@technicbuilder6410,I think I know why your bullets didn't fuse. Metals like to fuse together when they are hot. Those two bullets from civil war were likely fired out of guns that have already been shot and their barrels were hot. Try warming up the barrel after it has been loaded and do it for a while so that heat can transfer into the bullets.,4주 전,0,

You'd end up with the bullets meeting with matching rotation instead of opposing, and that would eliminate one source of motion that could prevent a fusing event.",2년 전,23,
@BleuSquid," @Mikado80813  That was my first thought, but I looked up the Minié ball and that bullet was designed specifically for rifling: ""The development of the Minié ball was significant because it was the first projectile type that could be made a loose enough fit to easily slide down the barrel of a rifled long gun, yet maintain good accuracy during firing due to obturation by expansion of the bullet's base when fired.""",2년 전(수정됨),5,

Now that you bring it up though, I wonder if a different twist rate to the rifling could affect the process?  Edit: I might be making the wrong analogy but think of it like a knuckleball pitcher vs a traditional pitcher. The knuckleballer wants almost no spin and instead lets the imperfections of the ball (seams, thread, etc.) move it in erratic ways while the traditional pitcher imparts spin to make it cut through the air, strike more accurately and/or move in very particular ways.",2년 전(수정됨),2,

@streetfightinmanrs,"A few things that I think affect the results: -You may need to cast your own lead bullets. Most manufacturers today will add a bit of tin to make them harder, so eliminating that tin should help stop the bullet from fragmenting. -The Minie ball fired from the Springfield rifled muskets had a concave base in order to expand to meet the rifling in the musket.  -The minie balls fired from Springfields were .58 caliber opposed to the .45 used in your tests which means there are some additional factors needed to replicate what you had seen in the museum. -The .58 caliber balls weighed 500 grains opposed to the 200 grains of the .45 LC. There is a 600ish grain difference in mass transfer between the two bullet types colliding. -The typical .58 traveled at about  944 FPS from a 40in barrel as opposed to the 900 FPS from the .45, usually in a 5 3/4 in barrel.  - the combat range which the bullets fired against each other could have also affected the result for the museum’s example, as the muzzle energy of the rounds could have dissipated a little bit if both muskets were fired at their maximum effective range of 300yds, intercepting around 150 yards.  If I had to guess, going with a soft lead .58 traveling around 600-750 FPS would probably yield the result you are looking for while staying generally true to what happened.",2년 전,2,
@ihdieselman,"@SmarterEveryDay hey Destin, I wonder If the reason that the bullet fused through the wallet was because the aluminum had stripped away part of the bullet exposing fresh unoxidized lead. Perhaps the soldiers bullets had been carried in a satchel pouch and the bullet tips were freshly polished as a result? Or perhaps it's because they had rammed it down the barrel and that polished the end of the bullet? That would be an interesting hypothesis to test. Also, maybe there is an alloy in the lead that the bullets are made of that is preventing them from fusing. Try casting some bullets with pure lead. Maybe it would change it.

What happens when a bullet is fired from a gun down the barrel of another gun of equal weight? Would the recoil of the second gun be equal to the recoil of the original? If everything were perfectly aligned, the bullet would bounce back and forth between barrels until friction and pressure loss between the barrels would stop the motion.

@DaSharedVideos,"The bullets/mini-balls seem to be fragmenting rather than deforming like the Fredericksburg Minie balls in the display exhibit.   If you haven't done so already, you may want to considering doing a metallurgical analysis of civil war era Minie balls to make sure they have the same ductile characteristics.  Temperature may also be a factor.  Are you cold firing the bullets using cold compressed air or are you also simulating live black powder fire and long rifled barrel friction to get the Minie balls up to temperature?  Another consideration is that if the Fredericksburg Minie balls were fired at a considerable distance apart, that their velocities may have been a lot less than in your demonstration tests which could allow for more time for them to deform and fuse.  Have you also tried reducing the relative velocities of the Minnie balls?  For a more controlled sampling of the fragments, have you considered laying some type of clean substrate under the test apparatus, such as a clean white drop cloth, canvas or just a blue or green tarp so that you have a better chance to collect all the fragments?

@reginaldsmith752,"It's not going to fuse because the temperature is not high enough. If you make the bullets out of silver you might have better luck. The silver doesn't store as much kinetic energy as lead. That's what's why winchester silver tips kill better at lower velocity than lead. They mushroom better and stay together without fragmented therefore they expend a larger amount of energy in the path of the bullet. SHOCK!!! Fragmenteing causes more bleeding but much less shock. At infantry ranges you don't get shock therefore you want fragmentation to insure the target is more likely to be taken out of the fight. Therefore, multiple small caliber rounds emulated fragmentation even if the individual bullets don't fragment. That's why we train fore the 3 or 5 shot burst at distance. Of course it also adds to the potential for a hit at conventional I pantry engagement ranges. Naturally that goes out the window inurban or sniper engagements. But try silver or a silver lead mix and get rid of the antimony in your lead mix. A longer barrel and 45 70 may allow you to reach near melting heat increasing the chances of vision. 45 LC with max loads out of a longer barrel might be worth a try before going to 45 70. The greater recoil may become an issue for your hardware. Though, it did look like you could have fired a locomotive down that I-beam.",8개월 전,0,

Tin and Antimony both make modern bullets MUCH more harder (and LIGHTER), and so would have a tendancy to shatter more easily.  The other obvious factor is that these civil war miniballs would have been going MUCH slower...for three reasons:  1)  The solid lead miniballs of between 52-69 caliber would have been MUCH heavier than these 45 cal bullets used...at least 2-3 times as heavy; 2) The black powder charges would have produced much less pressure, thus having slower speeds (even with long barrels)...not to mention the blow-by from using patches and imperfectly round projectiles; and 3) The two miniballs that met on that day in the civil war were fired across a battlefield, presumably up to 100 yards apart...both miniballs had slowed down DRASTICALLY by then.  The other thing I will point out, is those fused miniballs in the museum are almost certainly NOT the full weight of the two original miniballs!  There most certainly was a fair amount of lead splattered on that impact...and what was eventually discovered was only the part that fused together.  Finally....the thoughts that went into designing this experiment (especially from a safety standpoint), was nothing less than BRILLIANT!!!",8개월 전,0,

@DaSharedVideos,"The bullets/mini-balls seem to be fragmenting rather than deforming like the Fredericksburg Minie balls in the display exhibit.   If you haven't done so already, you may want to considering doing a metallurgical analysis of civil war era Minie balls to make sure they have the same ductile characteristics.  Temperature may also be a factor.  Are you cold firing the bullets using cold compressed air or are you also simulating live black powder fire and long rifled barrel friction to get the Minie balls up to temperature?  Another consideration is that if the Fredericksburg Minie balls were fired at a considerable distance apart, that their velocities may have been a lot less than in your demonstration tests which could allow for more time for them to deform and fuse.  Have you also tried reducing the relative velocities of the Minnie balls?  For a more controlled sampling of the fragments, have you considered laying some type of clean substrate under the test apparatus, such as a clean white drop cloth, canvas or just a blue or green tarp so that you have a better chance to collect all the fragments?  If you're using lead, then all the lead fragments flying about are likely to contaminate the soil.",9개월 전,0,

@michaels7410,"I believe it comes down to two main factors: 	1.	Speed: Due to the short distance, the bullets fired from both guns are traveling at extremely high speeds. In contrast, during the Civil War, the distances between opposing forces were likely greater, giving bullets more time to lose some of their velocity. 	2.	Ballistics: If my assumption about the shorter distance is correct, the ballistic properties of the bullets play a role as well. The rapid spinning (caused by rifling) of the bullets would be less pronounced over longer distances as the spin slows down. With two bullets spinning at such high speeds and colliding head-on, they are more likely to shatter or collapse rather than fuse together.",9개월 전,0,

@primemac3dstudio18,During the Civil War materials was lower quality. So your probably have issues because your bullets quality mix is to clean. I would suggest finding a civil war bullet and get the quality checked. Then duplicate the bullet values. Also black powder during that time was of lower quality.

@emeqgershown3064,"Well I watched until you picked the bullets you’re going to use and the distance the barrels were set apart on the beam. THIS WILL NEVER WORK! I think you came up with an interesting idea but the civil war mini-balls were propelled by black powder and the armies were at greater distance, at least when the battle began. So you need to use black powder (type 1, 2, or 3 since they used any powder available). The most common mini-ball was 58 cal. but the weight varied since they made many of them over a camp fire with crude molds.  The mini-balls must be pure lead, today’s lead substitute is to brittle. Increase the distance between barrels to at least 75 - 50 yards; or reduce the black powder charge to get a working velocity (FPI). Once the bullets are hitting each other adjust the amount of black powder (not a BP substitute) until they melt together on impact. You accounted for many variables but the most important for making these bullet weld together is in the civil war ammunition and distance = bullet speed at impact. (Remember during the civil war most Black Powder used by the confederate army was hand made in mines right below the Union troops. This means the flash point of the ingredients, and moisture content, is a big variable. For this reason they frequently scavenged munitions and powders from the Union troops after winning a battle. Cannon grade powder was frequently mixed with lower ignition point powders to reduce chamber pressure in the muskets, this makes reproducing the actual mini-ball speed a variable that you may never find). You may need to do some homework to see if the powder quality is known to historians. If it is you can experiment with powder charges of mixtures of BP 1, 2, and 3.  You have a-lot of rework to do. The starting distance of the battle is a matter of record, but troops charged to close the gap frequently, and just as frequently needed to retreat to find cover.  This is what makes reproducing the fused bullets so hard, hitting two bullets together has been done before, it’s just geometry and fixed barrel positions which you have done. Good luck with the rest.",11개월 전,0,

@denisleblanc4506,"As mentioned below, the fused bullets were going a lot slower and were softer. I'm not sure it was mentioned but I think your rifling twist is also faster. This were try to tear the bullet fragments apart more. Another factor that might have prevented fusion is the fact that on impact they are actually spinning in different directions. They would have to stop spinning relative to each other to fuse. The waller probably helped to stop the spinning of the first bullet enough so that the second bullet had a better chance to fuse. It goes back to the more energy that has to be dissipated the smaller the fragments. You have the rotational energy from the spinning bullets and the kinetic energy from the speeds of the bullets. You had solid lead bullets and the minié balls had very hollow bases. This may have helped the minié balls hold together because the hollow bases would have less total rotational energy and could have expanded around the solid noses keeping them together. You have to repeat this using shotgun slugs. The Forster style slugs. You should be able to get low velocity without any spinning, or if you have to use very slow rifling twist.

@GamerCaveman,"I would try putting a block of ballistic gel at the point of impact. This should fix the bullets fragmentation issue at impact and allow for them to fuse. I'm sure you'd love to have a whole new stack of variables. If you can get the gel block density uniform you can mold it in say 2"" tubes and just cut to different lengths. Then create a clear housing to place at the point of impact to hold them, with some holes to vent the displaced gel. This should reduce the chance of the bullets being deflected, control where any possible cast-off goes, and give you a clearer image. I would consider mounting to the same lifting mechanism as your deflectors so you don't have access it while directly in the line of fire but that might be overkill. I do think it would make that fused bullets story even more amazing. But it would also be tragic because it implies someone being shot by their own side in the crossfire. I'd be curious to see the bullets under a microscope to check if the have any indicators that they impacted anything else besides each other.  Love the channel.

@jmizarob,"I suspect the composition of the bullet was softer and more susceptible to melting. If the bullets are heated more before the explosion propels them out of the barrels, I think a fusion would be more likely. Run a test melting two bullets to see what temperature they fuse at. Then, run another test measuring the temperature of a bullet as it's firing. If the civil war bullets had more mass, the force needed to propel that mass might have been hot enough or had more time to transfer enough heat into the bullet for fusion.",1년 전,0,

@MultiAlbon,"Hello hello, many times I saw nice videos from your channel, today I know that you was working with soldiers :D  So lets go to the point of this video, that thing in museum is from old guns, and low power, probability hand make. Both bullets starts from long range before they hit each other, that thing is in museum.  Now how we can do that, because need much calculation...  type of bullet, long range before losing direction after need build tools like you already created.  I try to explain an example idea... first we dont need any heavy gun, but precision to shoot pistol bullet (exmp) gun from pistol can go 50meter before loses direction or losing his power in the air. gun from gun must stay in distance 75 to 95meter, ofcourse laser needed for calculation till it comes to the point we need. protection also can be more save because gun can hit other gun with full power or simple bullet can fall down before reaches other gun in to other side.  I know is not very easy, because distance brings more trouble things, day from day also makes the difference because one day rain and another day sun = how wet can be air, after the temperature maybe is one other factor when you continue to calculate from one day to another.  In my mind you, risk little because 2 sides of guns, are very close to do this experiment. Thank you!",1년 전,0,

@Databyter,"Try letting the bullets hit each other within a more dense medium than air. Like a water bottle. I think that would count. Slow it down without adding any material to the mix. Plastic is trivial, water won't stick to the metal or merge with it. You may get a nice weld within a water bottle of the right size. Water will significantly slow a bullet very quickly. You might even need to ADD powder again to have enough force to merge. These are all just layman guesses. I just know that you can't really shoot a person that is only a few feet under water, because the energy would quickly disperse. Maybe I'm wrong about that too. Another interesting experiment. When I see a movie, and somebody is shot at 6 feet underwater from a guy standing on shore or the side of a pool. I am very skeptical that the bullet would make it that far with any force. Never tried it. Perhaps a rifle or a magnum round could do it, but not a typical handgun round.",1년 전,0,

@stefansoderback5074,If the bullits rotate in the same direction it probably would fuse easier. That means that your barrels need to rotate the bullit differently. One pipe rotates the bulllit to the left an the other rotates it to the right and that will result in rotation at the same direction when the bullits meets and they’ll fuse easier because the rotation forces will disappear 😅  Thanks for a great video.,1년 전,0,

@JMW1906,"One small thing that might help with getting two bullets to fuse is the direction in which they rotate. If I understand correctly the barrels are made to give the bullet some angular momentum for a more stable flight path (gyroscope effect). If I saw it correctly (and based on the assumption that both guns are made identical) the bullets spin in a different direction. The angular momentum in different directions should mean they are slightly less likely to fuse into one, as the impact zone has to deal with both the frontal impact (deformations caused by that and a bounce back) and that rotation difference.  Awesome video :)  I could also be completely wrong and having them rotate in different directions (both counterclockwise in the flight direction) might be better.

Also says something nasty about potentially deliberately engineered lead fragmentation compared to civil war era bullets. Personally I view any lead bullet as a war crime based on that it is toxic, poisonous and carcinogenic but specially ones designed to explode, expand or shatter and fragment.

@fanwlkr,"As a weldor who have taken extra classes in metallurgy I think that they might be using like ""cast lead"" to make bullets. Fusing cast metal is harder because there are added more carbon and junk in there, to save on steel and make it easy to pour. That lead seems to act way different from the lead I used to shoot back in the days, and the friction from that impact is definitely enough to make it past the melting point of pure lead at 327.5 °C (621.5 °F). I saw in one of Jonathan Ferguson videos that old muskets fire with a lower muzzle velocity than most modern pistols, so I would guess that with the low gunpowder bullets you guys made, that this should be in the ballpark, however I think factors like shape of the round and distance could be factors as well. I would advice you guys to contact the manufacturer of the rounds you used and ask them about the lead they use to see if there are any factors there you could adress with little effort ;) Cool video, awesome stuff",1년 전,0,

@djfunk8000,Hey Destin I'm a little late to this video haha but I'm a metallurgist here in the US. You mentioned in the video that the composition of the Pb might be to blame for lack of fusion... that could be but I'd also suggest that it could be related to the hardness of the lead itself. Like you mentioned composition can affect the hardness. I'd guess increased hardness may result in a higher propensity for fracture upon impact. If different composition lead isn't an option I'd suggest annealing the bullets prior loading them. Annealing the material may result in decreased hardness and increased toughness. Just a very rough rule of thumb but I'd try annealing a batch at 70-80% melting temp for whatever amount of time is reasonable. Increased time at temperature will result in increased softening of the material. Of course at those crazy strain rates all bets are off but just a suggestion in case lead with different composition proves difficult to come by. God Bless.,1년 전,0,

Secondly, as soon as you got 2 bullets to hit but not fuse I thought, you need to use soft lead bullets, not typical hard alloys (or jacketed bullets), and you need to load them to a lower velocity.

Leave like a 3 inch gap  in the center so be able to watch the bullets collide. Get a couple of rifles of the same caliber & same velocity ammo. Put the rifles in vices on opposite ends. Have strings or mechanical devices that pull the triggers on both guns at the same time. So if the bullets collide  head on at the same time they should cancel out each others energy & drop to the bottom of the steel box. Also don't forget to put a little 5 inch x 5 inch door on the front of the steel box. Maybe have another small hole for a pen head camera to see the bullets collide.

The distance is so small that I don't think the loss of accuracy would be an issue and the rotation of the bullets might be reducing the chances of fusing.

@qwertysspam2104,"I think the reason U couldnt get the bullets to fuse together is because with  the fused civil war one, the barrels if the 2 guns where probably quite a bit further apart than the 6 or 8 ft distance between the barrels on Ur Test Rig. So the Civil War Bullets collided at a Much lower Velocity...  Also, Using Modern bullets + Gun Barrels, the Gunpowder burns more efficiently + the better engineering tollerances between the Modern Barrels + the Bullets, thus resulting in less energy losses when Compared to Civil War Era Bullet and Barrlel Engineering Tolerances which where worse, compounding the loss of Inertia of both the Civil War Bullets, so they hit with a Lot less force.

@chngdbygrace,"16:12 if I had to guess at this point I would say the bullets used are of a harder more brittle material, and the powder or energy may be stronger than the event in the civil war that lead to the fused rounds...  There are a ton of factors from that time period that may have lead to different elements like maybe lower grain counts, wet powder, soldier made rounds from a mix of metals at hand or dirty lead.  Then there are factors like distance between firing points... I mean the soldiers may not have been firing at each other of one missed and collided with a round from a different soldier... In that case that may have been a round that spent a lot of energy, may have gone through clothing, brush, etc and then collided with a round with more energy.  You may get an idea of the material used if there are other rounds from that conflict, check to see if the military records for the arms and munitions supplied to the units is available, maybe even the time of the conflict in light of the full war may give insight to just how respectful the soldiers had to be if they were leading their own bullets...

@daleskidmore1685,"There is, or was, some 40 odd years ago a WW1 British Army rifle in the Imperial War Museum on London, England which had had a bullet enter the barrel and fuse with the bullet fired by the rifle in the bore. Alongside the gun was an X Ray photograph showing the barrel with the bullets clearly visible. Loved the experiment and the thought that went into it. It did occur to me through the yid that, perhaps, setting a bullet on a plate in front of one gun and firing the other at it, you may effectively double the distance of the travel and halving the velocity, rather like the distance travelled by the original bullets. It may even be possible to increase the effective distance travelled because the variables are reduced,",1년 전,0,

Additionally, it's worth considering the influence of the weapon's heat on lead rounds in the barrels, possibly softening them enough to induce fusion. Drawing inspiration from your video explanation, where minimal flash occurs when lead meets flush with the rifling, this concept could extend to the original fused bullet. If it encounters a flame protruding from the barrel, it might sufficiently soften the lead for fusion.  After thought: Maybe when you shot the alluminium wallet there was some heat transfer enough for the fusion?",1년 전,0,

@barbarapiercy4312,"I know this is really late but, as an engineer and a shooter I just have to make a comment. Your methodology is almost flawless!! The only two things you didn’t consider…..well, one thing. Ok, the one you figured out was that the lead was too hard! The lead that was used during the Civil War was pure lead. There was no Antimony or Zinc in it. The one you didn’t consider the fact that the bullets were 69 and/or 75 caliber. A considerable increase in mass. That coupled with the softer lead, I think will give you the results you’re looking for.  PS. “All you have to do is “ cut off a section of the breech end to be able to use your shorter cartridges! Which was an excellent idea using the shorter cartridges because the ignition in the bigger cartridges would be inconsistent.  Nothing wrong with being Smarter Every Day!!

@hodgykillerraw7575,2 things to consider. Modern lead bullets have other metals added to make them harder then normal lead. May try getting pure lead and casting your own bullets. Also try using actual black powder or black powder substitute instead of smokeless powder. Black powder has a significantly slower burner time which will reduce velocity while still having enough gas expansion to get the projectile to clear the barrel.

The lead alloy used in those days would have been pure lead, which would have made them very soft and, in my opinion, may have aided in the fusion. Modern projectiles comprise around 96% lead, 1% linotype, and 3% tin. Linotype and tin make a bullet harder.

@tsherwoodrzero,"Excellent work and I'm glad nobody got hurt thanks to all of the safety procedures put in place. Judging from how each of the projectiles shatter on impact,  it appears to be a matter of material hardness. More specifically the projectiles disintegrate from being too hard and brittle vs the Civil War example fusing together due to it being softer and more ductile. There's a channel called Crazy Hydraulic Press that puts various objects and materials in a 100 ton Hydraulic Press to see how they compare, such as an old sledgehammer vs a new chinese one. SPOILERS The chinese hammer deforms and presses down like play dough in a rather linear, consistent manner. The old hammer doesn't budge until around 300 tons, then it explodes violently. They have high speed cameras on it to show a slowed-down replay to better examine how it happens too. Softer materials will have smoother deformation, which is the desired result here.  For a simple comparison, try shearing the head off of a class 4.8 bolt vs a class 10.9 one of the same size and examining them under the microscope. The 4.8 bolt's distortion at the separation point will be longer and smoother, while the 10.9 will look considerably more ""gritty"".",1년 전(수정됨),5,

@leo.koogle,excellent scientific procedure with top notch safety measures 👍🏻 would love to see more videos repeating the experiment with some adjustments suggested in the comments to see if you can get the bullets to fuse. to add my own suggestion: longer barrels (like those of civil war rifles) could possibly help as it may assist in slowing the bullets down further so that they don't obliterate each other. this in addition to using black powder and doing repeated 'test fires' (simulating realistic battle and thus the actual conditions in place for the civil war bullet) could keep the barrel warm enough to make the ammunition more malleable.,1년 전,3,

Now at the same time, these bullets could have both traveled a great distance before meeting, and it could have been right after the peak of their kinetic energy where there was not to much force to break everything apart, and not enough force for them to bounce either!

@jasonkoval4750,"I really like the beauty of the collisions when they are aligned, and the copper jacket splits into symmetrically-oriented ribbons that eject outward.  The lack of fusion got me thinking about velocities, temperature, and material properties. Now that I think about it, temperature might just be related to velocity at impact.  More velocity is more energy to convert into deformation, sound, heat.  To make them fuse, we need not so much rebound upon contact, so a softer material might work better, like you said.  I also thought about impact mechanics during a meteorite impact.  You never seem to see the impactor because the energy is so high that everything melts and gets distributed as ejecta, etc.  So I guess we want a happy medium in the materials and velocities.

@richardshawver7264,Civil war lead was just lead. Very soft. Modern lead is hardened with antimony even the lead you would cast bullets from. Much harder. Hence the shattering and lack of fusing. Who knows the distance both bullets flew before impact. Hence velocity. Probably near falling out of the air.  Civil war weapons used black powder. Slower burn rate  More a push then a slam of modern powder. Possibly your barrels are to short. Just some ideas to give you can look into.,1년 전,0,

@richardhowell7040,I would like to say some thing about your metallurgy. If I were you I would add a bunch of tin to your lead and perhaps remove some antimony my theory is the antimony causes the bullets to shatter and the lead and tin alloy would be more likely to fuse to the second bullet.

When you have a case with a primer in the back, powder inside and a bullet in the front ready to be loaded into your firearm you have a cartridge.  Your reloading ""expert"" should have corrected your terminology before you made the video. I don't think much of your expert. And then you load the guns with the aperture open so you are not safe from the opposite gun. Look at 10:56 to about 11:05 into the video. It looks like you're using hard cast bullets.

@ocng,"I think the rifling might be part of the problem: it creates breaking points - seen when the bullets colliding create perfect flower-petal-like structures. Also: is your rifling the same in both barrels or do the bullets rotate in opposite directions relative to one another? When rotating against each other, a film of fluid metal forms (like with ice skating - just not linearly but rotating). This is also kept fluid as long as the bullets keep rotating. This could be a good thing like with friction welding - but there the two parts are kept aligned firmly by holders. I could not see one case of the bullets stopping their counter rotation in any of the slowmo footage - so if they never stop rotating, the film is alwys there, allowing for easy low friction sliding and never freezing solid. Combined with the introduced breaking points from the rifling (what about polygonal or no rifling?) this might create conditions which are different from the minié ball situation. Also: are the bullets coated with lubricant?",2년 전,2,

@budzo100,"Howdy Destin,  Have you considered that the fused bullet in the museum was probably fired with Black Powder.  Which, in my very limited experience, is slower and has much less velocity of a projectile propellent.  So when you started on this video to use less powder, and seemed to have some progress.  I think this is trending toward the key ingredient.  Your correct in saying that the lead, as well, may have been of a different grade back in the musket days than today.  Probably more alloys in todays lead.  But just my two cents worth from a gun nut.  Great video, keep up the very cool work.  Cheers,",2년 전,0,

For two solids of like materials to fuse, they need to be in an altered state of matter, being either gaseous or liquid at the moment of impact. Then return to solids while the two non solids are still impacting, in order to fuse two solids impacting each other. This is why it's never happened. The closest you can get is if one ballistic shaped solid impacted an oblique solid, they could possibly become lodged under high enough pressure, to SEEM fused... but will actually just be lodged under high pressure, which is what you see with the wallet shot. The material added to the slug can be payed off, without melting, using a razor blade and magnifying glass... because fusion did not occur.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

The civil war rifles the minie balls were barely super sonic though for their weight they may not have been so there's that so about 1k to 1200 fps. Which you also need to consider their size and weight of those projectiles anywhere from 60 to 70 caliber weighing in at a hefty 1.25 to 1.5 oz's. So as well as dialing in your powder charge why not dialing up the weight of your bullets. As 45 caliber and at best 250 grain bullet is a fraction of the size of those civil war minnie balls.,2년 전,1,

You would think those bullets would have been laying down under the grass an dirt an some body with a metal detector found them an dug them up, right. How long were they hidden before they were found. An think how could two bullets fuse together in the air. I'd say a lucky shot after millions of bullets were fired passing one another then two of one day hit each other, yes very possible. But I think there was a long distance between the two men to slow the force of the bullets and the spin slowed down too. We don't know but one could have been fired first then second shot got fired and they was not meeting exactly between the two men, an one might have been about to drop when other found it. We wasnt there to see it happen. But i did very much enjoy your set up and appreciate all your hard work and with all your friends helping you with it makes this a very awesome memorable video buddy.

Most bullets today are not made with peer lead it’s considered hard cast so it’s an amalgam it’s much harder than lead typically is secondly bullets from the older age or much longer so 45 long colt might be proper but you might actually need a longer bullet altogether. I would suggest casting your own lead using a custom mold to make the bullet about ~twice as long allowing it to be considered a “soft cast”,2년 전,0,

Too much energy in the system is undoubtedly one of them, and the lead alloy being too hard compared to pure lead bullets is probably another, but I think that the shape of the bullets is another one; minié balls have a very deep conical void at the back, which I expect would make a difference.

@supertophashinshin191,Also consider the type of barrel you are shooting from  It looks like you have some form of a lighter metal which likely cools down faster between shots  in the war gun barrels would have been very thick steel that heats up a lot when you use it or extensive amount of shots - so presumable the surface temperature of the lead bullet would be a bit higher making the lead softer on the outside and likely to stick to the other warmer softer bullet  just some thought - i am not expert,2년 전,0,

Furthermore the lead you use is too soft, you need to add other metals like tin. This alloy will be stronger and will dump more energy at the point of impact, creating more intense heat whilst maintaining most of the mass of the bullet in one piece instead of splattering with lead fragments.",2년 전,1,

@travelfeet,"A few thoughts, The musket balls probably weren't spinning, as muskets did not have rifling in the barrel, so that is another factor in collision dynamics. Half way through the video and you have not mentioned what powder loads you are using/muzzle velocity of your rounds. Black powder loads were typically lower velocity I think than modern smokeless powder generally is. The barrels you are using look pretty beefy, but heat buildup might be a factor in shifting the aim over time as well. It not clear how much time there is between shots so I really have no idea if this has any impact either way. I am assuming your reloading expert is confident in the consistency of the loads, but that should also be ruled out. This whole experiment is fantastic regardless of the misses.",2년 전,0,

So my point is that, the lead alloy used for Minié balls must have more plasticity than today bullets.

Then consider the distance between the rifles. As a bullet travels it looses speed… so at close range the bullets are pretty much at peak velocity… also I’m not an expert but surely the actual bullets back then were lead. Not copper or alloys. So the metal in the bullets have different stress tolerances.   This is a 1 in a million shot… however you won’t be able to do it with modern ammo at a range between the guns of less that 10 meters.   Just a thought…,2년 전(수정됨),0,

All in all the slow heavy bullets would, on two counts, have more chance of fusing, Firstly because of lack of speed and secondly because the mass of each bullet would assist in withstanding some of the energy and hopefully have more of a chance of fusing. Whilst Minie bullets are available, it would perhaps be a pain to do muzzle loading, so for simplicity, perhaps a downrated 50 Action Express with lead round nose bullets would give better results, the .50"" Action Express coming close to the Minnie bullets .58"".",2년 전(수정됨),0,

What I have found out that the .577 minie bullet traveled at 950 fps and had a range of approx. 1000 yards, but the ballistic trajectories was a high arch 1000 yards. Most shots were within 50 to 100 yards of there target. As an experiment you could never reproduce these 2 bullets joining head to head like that again in a thousand years.

I think they have to analyze this video with some theoretical physicist or some experimental physicist, at minute 25 in the collision of the bullets it makes me think that they were involuntarily manipulating time, what do I mean, that the suspension of the two bullets slowed down the time that elapsed in that collision space, take into account that the speed in one way or another manipulates the mass of the objects and therefore time can also be manipulated, IMPORTANT NOTE; In case this leads to the discovery of time travel, please, I will demand 1% of the royalties. ha ha ha ha.

@stuartodell1709,"Question: were the civil war rifles rifled? or smooth bore? Not with ball and wad they were not. So using rifled guns changes the friction of the bullet or ball. So without the rifling the bullet  using ball and wad would go easier down the barrel (less friction) that would mean less or weaker powder could be used slowing the bullet/ball enough to get it to fuse. Or am I just blowing wind? Another question, why didn't you use lasers to shoot down the center of one barrel and a photo cell looking back (from the breach of second barrel) to align them instead of shooting the the paper and aligning on that. I think it would have been more accurate since both barrels would be aligned.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@sgsellsit,"This is one of the coolest videos I think I have seen in a while.  The attention to detail and time you put into your content is amazing.  Keep up the good work.  Civil war era bullets were formed of pure soft lead and some toxic red lead.  Furthermore the variable still remains as to powder load.  Since muskets or black powder rifles were loaded in such a hurry either by powder bag or even what was a prefilled paper cartridge they were never the same as it wasn't always measured or some was spilled.  The velocity of that era's rifle was also significantly lower.  So depending on the range at which each rifle was fired, they could have been at maximum range when they hit.  Most bullets of that era were smaller than the bore for easier, faster loading and very inconsistent.  Some regiments had arms masters and crews that made bullets, buck ball bags etc.  Supply wagons would often bring armory made munitions.  Many soldiers and even rebels had molding kits in their ruck.  They would repurpose lead they found.  Field medics and doctors would often collect lead from wounded and dead soldiers to reuse.  Another variable may be the type of gun used.  The North being made up of mostly organized military regiments would have had government issued equipment.  The South on the other hand was made up up of some organized military but also many settlers, farmers, northern deserters, etc. with their own guns.  Some dating back to the Revolutionary war.  Due to the economic conditions in the South, cheaper guns or even handmade guns were used.  Rifles could be rifled or even smooth bore barrels.  Interestingly enough one of the worst wartime and even post wartime injuries to come from the Civil War was....you guessed it...lead poisoning.  This came from not only wounds but the just the sheer volume soldiers handled on a day to day basis.  FYI.  We have another tractor pull coming up in Lexington, Alabama on August 11 & 12, 2023.

@Duke00x,"You are likely looking at four (though some are connected) variables that are causing them not to fuse and only three of them are somewhat easy to solve. 1. Longer barrel in the original meaning more friction for longer and longer exposure to possibly higher temperatures (full loads vs you partial loads mean more heat as well as more velocity) which could have heated up the lead more making it softer. This can't be solved by just making longer barrel. 2. As stated before stronger/hotter load as stated in the point before this could have led to more heat longer causing softer lead. This can be fixed by loading more gun powder into the round. 3. Modern lead is different then old lead. Not only in alloy but also in production a lot of modern rounds are made by pressing metal powder into molds (sometimes with external heat but other times just with the heat of the conpression). Where as old lead was melted and poured into molds. This makes modern lead fragment more. Well more like practicalize. Where as old lead stays together more. This can be fixed by mak8 g your own rounds and trying to get as close as you can to the lead alloy they used back then. 4. Distance. Those rounds likely started out a lot faster but slowed down before meeting this is how you can have a longer barrel abd the needed load to still get the round out of the barrel which also allows for 1 and 2 and the corresponding side effects. This one may be impossible to fix at least on a practical side of things not a technical side of things. First you would have to try and find what the distance was. This is more trial and error after you fix the other issues. And doing this would introduce a bunch of issues that would mean you had to be even more precise in aiming (a nanometer off over 1,000 means a bigger miss then over 5 meters).   All that be8ng said I would start with the lead and go from there. Actually soeak8ng of the lead and back then I just thought of another possible variable. Reuse. They often reused rounds. If these ro7nds had been used more then once in a short time frame they may not have fully cooled from the last use when shoot meaning the outside may have been cool but the inside may have been warm making them softer.   Thinking about it there are really only two variables lead alloy and lead temperatures. Right lead alloy at right temperature thus the right softness add impact and boom fusion.",2년 전,0,

@Andicus,"The bullets impacting each other look like galaxies in the 3d planes they create on the tangent line. Beautiful.  Edit: 22:03 wow that is INCREDIBLE. Thank you for letting us see this. The bullet stopping right there would mean it was a perfectly inelastic collision correct? Or maybe not exactly (as the bullets exploded and fragments went everywhere, would that be the lost kinetic energy?), but the back of the bullets at the very least WERE. So that would mean the masses of these bullets and their velocity were the exact same (or extremely similar). That's the one in a million shot right there. There's a saying that ""Luck is what happens when Preparation meets Opportunity"" and.. this is it right here. You guys had the setup, and kept the attempts going to study the head-on collisions of bullets. And preparation indeed met opportunity as we got to witness this wonderful moment.  The slower bullets looked like flowers when they collided. xD",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@_Shay_,Haven’t seen the whole video but my guess for why the bullets don’t fuse and just explode is because they’re too close to each other. The civil war bullets were probably fired farther apart and by time they impacted they had lost power and they fused. Instead since these guns are so close to one another there’s no time for the bullets to lose enough power to not just obliterate each other.,2년 전,0,

It is the shape of the projectiles. The mini balls are just that, balls. The modern bullets are cylinders with blunt or rounded ends. The mass of the lead with the balls keeps the energy focused on the center because of the shape of the projectile. The cylinders want to expand as the lead compresses and splinter outward. Because the ball contains the kinetic energy rather than fragmenting and dissipating it, the focused energy fused the two balls together.",2년 전,0,

Suggestions: 1 find some civil war rifle enthusiasts, show them the video and ask whats wrong. 2 minie balls were greased, that is likely a factor. 3 minie balls were an iron plug with lead skirting weren't they? That would make a huge difference as far as fusion. 4 minie balls were smaller than the diameter of the bore and expanded on firing, they may have fit the barrel looser and may not have been spinning the same way yours are. Fire some civil war guns or their replicas and measure twist rate of the bullet in the air with your fancy camera. The p53 Enfield had a 1:78 twist for example, but the projectiles were undersized to fit the paper cartridge so who knows how fast they were actually spinning when they came out. 5 I think your statements on metallurgy are spot on-weather it was cast or pressed, impurities, iron core, grease.

@jstephenallington8431,"I did not go through all of the comments (there's too many of them!), BUT!  Let me throw out a couple of ideas.      I think that there are a few differences between your experiment and the display you saw at the Smithsonian.         First: Velocity. The differences between modern day gunpowder and the ahem ""Gunpowder"" used during the American Civil War would be too numerous to even attempt to list here, let's just say that there's a bunch of them.  (Differences in grade, composition,  even in moisture, etc. etc.)  Second: The same applies to the ""lead"" used in the bullets.  The quality/grade used surely varied wildly from one batch made in Georgia in the 1800's,  and another batch made in Pennsylvania. Add to that the differences between what was being used one-hundred and fifty years ago and today. Third: Size, shape and weight of the round. Today's munitions are vastly different than the relatively primitive ammo of the 1800's, none of which were jacketed btw, which I'm certain is one of your problems as well.   There's more, (including the way that you're aiming the two at each other) but that's enough for now.    Good luck!",2년 전,0,

@SirFloofy001,"Im thinking your biggest problem with getting them to fuze is not the lead or the copper or how much powder you use, its the type of powder. Black powder doesn't burn in an explosion, it burns more in a conflagration. Its a slow (relative to smokeless powder) burn down a long barrel. The projectile speeds were lower then what you can get out of your smokeless short barreled guns. Remember, they used expanding miniballs meaning the miniballs were smaller then the rifling on the barrel and only fit the barrel once the powder went off and expanded the back of the miniball. Lot less friction meaning the projectile speeds didnt need to be as high to get the bullet to its destination.  At the end there yeah i think the aluminum slowed them down, but i think it also acted like a mold for the exploding lead and held it all together till it solidified together.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@bmurphy1603,Love the video.  Noticed one thing.  The historical bullets were fired in December in Virginia.  Their initial temperature could have been as low as 20 degrees F.  You tested in summer.  Could have been 80.  That 60 degree initial temp may have made a difference.  The interior of each bullet would have remained cold while the exterior was heated due to firing and friction in the rifle.  The colder bullets may have heated (due to impact) just to the point where they deformed and not to a point where they developed weakness and shattered.  Just a thought.,2년 전,2,

@trp-ur7gb,The barrel length probably contributes to the heat dissipation of the lead but also is it possible the mini balls were not fired from a rifled barrel? Rifling was still fairly new during the civil war but majority were using smooth bore. So the added rotation of the bullets makes them rip into each other and spiral fragments instead of mushrooming together.,2년 전,0,

@diddoall,As far as one bullet being harder that the other a Brinell hardness test could have answered that question. I would guess that they both would have been in the 4.0 to 5.0 range if they were pure lead. Wheel weights that are not pure lead run in the range between 9.0 and 11.0. Now we can take into account the two soldiers were probably not standing 6 feet apart. Standing 100 yard apart the two bullets would have slowed down considerably. The fusion would have a better chance of taking place  if both bullets were pure lead and traveling at a slower rate.,2년 전,1,

@jeromewaechter8466,"The video is truly great. Your setup is almost as it would have been. On the battlefield were some trees. It is likely that the bullets entered the limb of a tree. Based on my experience with lumber, the tree limb was about 2 inches in diameter. The bullets entered the limb from the north and south.  As shown in the video, the exploding force of impact causes a debris circle. If the bullets had met inside the tree limb, it would have contained the particles. The heat of impact would have fused the bullets into the single object. After the impact, the contained object would have remained at the impact site. However, the tree limb will have lost the ability to remain intact. Gravity would have pulled the outer part of the limb to the ground. The new object is likely to have stayed in the inner part of the limb. The local forces would not have caused much movement. After the battle, the field clean up crew would arrive. During the (likely undocumented) cleanup, a person would have found the lead object sticking to the broken limb, very likely at eye level. They would have removed the object and showed it later to others. They might not have recorded the location of their discovery. Thanks for making us smarter!",2년 전,5,

@CptFalkon,"I dont know what kind of bullets you were loading aside from the bullet styles, but from the intro it sounded like they were store bought. I am sure you are already aware, but store bought non-jacketed bullets have a protective coating to the lead to reduce lead exposure in both handling of the bullets as well as to reduce how much lead is vaporized and sent into the air when the cartridge is fired. If I had to guess, that protective coating might be a notable factor to why the bullets are colliding with each other but are not becoming fused together since it could be acting as a barrier between the two. If you decide to give this a try again, I think it would be worth hand casting the bullets or finding a way to clean off the protective coating on the store bought non-jacketed lead bullets before shooting them at each other.   The other thing that might be worth trying is to use the longer hard cast bullets in the cartridges (similar to the bear protection cartridges for example) instead of what I presume is the standard .45 long colt bullet dimensions. I think that the extra mass due to the longer bullet dimensions and harder metal might increase the chances of the bullets fusing by extending the length of time both bullets are colliding (generating more heat through more mass) and the harder metal might help reduce the percentage of the bullets that is sent away from the impact as fragments (may cause the bullets to fragment more).",2년 전,0,

@roneckler9937,"I have a Hypothesis on what the problem is with the bullets not fusing. The speed at which the bullets are traveling and the rotation of the bullets when they collide would cause the lead to melt and disintegrate upon impact. If only one bullet was traveling towards a stationary bullet the impact would be half the velocity of the two traveling at the same time. The two bullets you saw in the museum could have an embellished story behind them, or they were shot at such a distance from one another, that the speed was slow enough to not cause the lead to completely melt upon impact. I would check the velocity of a muzzle loader to know what the speed of the bullets are, and I would also remove the rifling in the barrels to stop the spin of the bullets. Lead melts at 621.5 deg Fahrenheit, so I believe the bullets at the velocity they are traveling would generate to much heat on impact to fuse like the two in the museum. It's just a thought.

(not offering my services just an idea) we thought you might be able to try and match the barrel rifling rotation so that the bullets are rotating in the same direction. so that they are not fighting each other as they make contact.  lastly my dad thought to ask if they might fuse in a steak? which might make the original bullet that much more incredible. cause we were wondering how they one knew the bullets hit, and how they found it on a battle field full of bullets. did they pull it out of someone.  just thoughts we have no way of knowing personally.  anxiously awaiting your next video!!",2년 전,0,

Would the produced drop be a did or would it experience different properties compared to a regular drop due to is far faster cool down,2년 전,1,

@az4running469,"As you pointed out, the lead was different, I'm guessing a little harder?  That is not the only factor interfering with the bullets fusing.  I think perhaps the bullets in 1862 were not fired from rifled barrels?  If I understand correctly, rifling was just becoming common at that time, but would not have been universal.  I'm guessing that your barrels were identically rifled identically.  It looks like that in the video.  Thus, since they were facing each other, they were spinning in opposing directions.  Using non-rifled barrels would make the bullets quite difficult to aim with precision.  But one barrel could be reverse-rifled, which would make them rotate in the same direction at roughly the same speed.",2년 전,0,

@WillPatagonia,"Impressive, let me give you (some output from Bard), about the Battle of San Lorenzo here in Argentina. San Martin ordered his army not to use firearms but only sabers (for agility proposes). Then we have this.    ""It is true that there have been reports of finding bullets split in half by the San Martín army sabres in the battlefield of San Lorenzo. These reports have been made by historians, archaeologists, and even tourists who have visited the site.  The most famous account of this phenomenon comes from the historian and archaeologist, José Toribio Medina. In his book, ""La Campaña de San Lorenzo"", Medina recounts how he found a number of bullets that had been split in half by sabres in the battlefield. He also describes how he saw similar bullets in the collections of other historians and archaeologists.  There are a few possible explanations for how these bullets could have been split in half. One possibility is that they were split by the sabres of the San Martín army during the battle. Another possibility is that they were split by the sabres of the Spanish army during the battle. It is also possible that the bullets were split after the battle, perhaps by people who were scavenging for souvenirs.  Whatever the explanation, the finding of these bullets is a fascinating piece of evidence from the Battle of San Lorenzo. It provides a tangible reminder of the violence and bloodshed that took place on that day. It also suggests that the San Martín army was well-equipped and well-trained, as they were able to split the bullets of their enemies with their sabres.""",2년 전,0,

And is it possible that the extremely rapid deforming of the lead raises the temperature enough to fuse them, even slightly?  There is less lead to dissipate the heat caused by a practically instantaneous deforming of the lead.  If I bend a paperclip back and forth fast enough, it gets too hot to handle.

You can get alloys with various compositions of lead with tin, antimony, and arsenic, all of which will make the bullet harder.  Sometimes, you get trace amounts of copper, silver, calcium, cadmium, zinc, etc.  The trick, in my opinion, would be to get an alloy with near-pure lead with maybe a bit of silver.  Adding silver lowers the melting point and may make the bullets more 'sticky', if you will.  You'd have to have pure lead at the contact point, but that would foul your barrels almost instantly.

@wombat6,"My first thought when the bullets just shattered on impact instead of fusing together was, way too much power. The gun tech, bullet tech, and very likely the gunpowder have evolved a lot between the original ""fused together"" shot, which would make replicating the shot with modern ammunition a job of WAY more accuracy (and luck). Maybe increase the distance between the guns, although I'm not sure that'll have a noticeable impact (and it'll make getting a collision much harder)... but yeah overall I think you need to reduce the power involved.",2년 전,0,

Altso i think i had a great idea. in a scenario similar to the wallets but where the aimpoint was offset, the object could really get some insane rotational speed, and if said object was engineered to withstand such and inpact and had a say a fixed propeller on top, and was free to move upwards.. that would probably be really cool.

@davidmessersmith786,"Destin, this is great work getting to this point. Really enjoyed the process part of your video. If you are interested, I think I can help progress your efforts to ultimately fuse two bullets in collision flight with some minor modifications to some key parameters. Your electronic firing mechanism is spot on for what it is intended. Adding to that would be closely controlling the bullet velocity to the impact. The powder mix and constancy is key to that. A simple velocity test with a chronometer would confirm the proper mix. That is a specialty of my son and a willing participant in this effort. In addition, the composition if the bullet as well as the shape should be closer to a civil war era bullet for some important physics reasons on the actual fusing of the material. One other aspect that may be important is the relative spin on each bullet. With the same spin from different directions, they are actually spinning in opposition to each other on a common axis. The rate of spin in the civil war era was minimal compared to current ballistic technology. Just slowing that down could help, but putting them on the same direction would eliminate it from the problem. The machining of matching but opposing barrels is also within the capability of my son. If your interested, let me know. We are willing an anxious to help if you want to pursue your dream to the end goal of fused bullets.",2년 전,4,

@BallardB,"@smartereveryday Have you considered trying to fire two bullets using a copper outer with a custom clay inner material. The fusion of the clay may be slightly easier to achieve but there may be some consistency issues. In addition, similar to pencil lead (graphite+clay) the composition of early lead bullets may not have as much lead content due to availability and demand during the civil war.  Also if the sleeve is copper then fusion of two dissimilar metals may make it difficult to achieve the fusion of the two bullets, so the sleeving may make it slightly harder to achieve fusion between the lead inner.  These are just some points for consideration but I am no expert in guns and bullets. Hope this helps with future attempts. Look forward to seeing more of your videos.",2년 전,0,

@shane5314,"Hi, I believe this was the first time I've seen your show, although your shows title sounds familiar, and I really love this one that you did. Bye, you try to fuse 2 bullet slugs by slamming them into each other head on from being fired from rifle barrels. I have always wondered what that would look like with high-speed photography. Awesome! Suggestion - you may want to use slugs made of all Heavy LED or lead iron as they used back in the Civil War. I can tell you the reason why those bullets refuse to fuse. The first reason is too much copper, the second most important reason is that rifles used back in the Civil War. Mostly, they were not rifled. Mostly because rifling just started in that timeline. And most rifles that had rifling was quite often worn smooth due to the inferior slugs they made. In just a short amount of time, thus having smooth barrels very little or no rifling left many times depending on the rifles they were using, so both bullet balls or slugs were not spinning making fusion possible quite often. The bullet slugs you were shooting were fired from rifled barrels, so both bullet slugs were spinning and spinning in opposite direction of each other, thus preventing them from fusing. If you can get the Slugs to hit each other head-on without the spin, you could probably get the fusion to work with bullet slugs you were using. That is why you got a partial fusion when you shot your aluminum wallet. It wasn't the fact of slowing it down, which was part of it. It was due to the fact it's greatly reduced the spin when they collided, thus fusion possible.  Or perhaps having one of the gun barrels rifled in the opposite direction, so both bullets will be spinning in the same direction when they collide. This I'm sure we'll make it possible to fuse. But I'm absolutely sure that you can get the bullets to fuse if you have no spin or minimal amount of spin when they collide. Also, the shape of your slugs would make a difference as well. Because you probably know the bullets that they made themselves back in that time. We're mostly round balls or close to round balls. And back in that time, they were not using shells, of course. Do to packing the gunpowder in and using material to pack in the gunpowder as well as fire cotton which was fast  combustion that allows the powder to ignite better, all these functions would massively heat up these led slugs to a very high temperature as they leave the barrel being surrounded by extremely high temperature explosion and combustion materials throughout the whole barrel. Even partially out of the barrel, which would contribute to extremely heated led slugs, which would definitely contribute to Fusion. These are definite factors to make fusion much more possible other than the spinning of the bullets, which I guarantee you is the main reason for non Fusion.",2년 전(수정됨),1,

I guess the lead in modern bullets tends to be forged [possibly cold?] whereas in the civil war they were more likely to cast molten lead. This will make a big difference to the crystal structure of the bullet and might explain why your bullets are a lot more brittle than the ones at the Smithsonian?   Perhaps if you're using a bullet in a firearm for protection you want the more brittle bullets because you don't want the main body of the bullet to ricochet.

@fly4doe2,"It occurs to me that ambient temperature has everything to do with this experiment's outcome. The specific heat of Lead is such that, it takes quite a bit of energy to move the thermometer.  However, the melting point is relatively low.  In your spring experiments, your lead was many degrees closer to the melting point than in the case of fusion at the battle of Fredericksburg.   The battle of Fredericksburg took place December 11-15, 1862.  The prevailing daytime temperature (researched in NOAA records, but not actually found by me) was, say, 30 degrees.    If I recall, you are near Huntsville, AL it appears to be spring in your video but you are not obviously sweating.  There is new growth on the trees.  Not sure what month you filmed but (per WeatherUnderground historical data) April 2023 average temps were 74 degrees, and May was 77 so the daytime noon (as determined by shadows observed in the video) temps were roughly 78 and 84 respectively.  I did not note you discussing freezing your leads when you discussed gunpowder loads and lead qualities.  However, I believe that if you cool your rounds down to 20 degrees(and otherwise play with lower temps) so that they are cold-soaked (as soldiers ammo would be exposed to outdoor temps continuously for days) at that temp before loading you would have closer true conditions to include temp which is a variable I don't see that your considered.  Your attempt at slowing the bullet down is a defacto attempt at preventing injection of extra kinetic energy into the Lead which becomes heat energy on impact.  By freezing the Lead you also achieve this goal and also ensure, through some metal contraction, that the lead does not hang in the barrel with low-power loads.  The reason the attempt with the aluminum wallet almost succeeded was probably not that the bullets were slowed, but that the aluminum (a great conductor of heat) absorbed some of the heat energy preventing the lead from fully liquifying and allowing partial fusion.  Of course, this is all just a wild guess.  ;-)",2년 전,0,
@matt2j.m929,"Im a M.E. not a chemical engineer, but for the last shot, what if the collision with the aluminum scrubbed the mating surface of the bullets clean? Like sanding pieces of copper before you solder them? Is this not essentially soldering with pressure? However, in this case there is no need for flux because there is not enough time between the aluminum scrubbing action and the two bullets colliding for oxides to form. Perhaps if you treated this as soldering you may have more success. Maybe clean the bullets before firing and put a thin layer of flux on them to keep oxides from forming? Getting the bullets to collide is impressive enough! but getting them to fuse? That's difficult enough on a workbench, let alone at such insane closing velocity.

@TheMechanator,"Amazing work. Very well through through.  Aligning the barrels with a laser was spot on.   I can't afford to donate to your patreon channel. But would if I could. So maybe I can lend a hand in the bullet making idea department. The gunsmiths in my family said that early bullets were made with a lower melting point lead of some alloy. Antimony makes it harder and is also used in early lead solder for electronics.  However when you make shotgun slugs out of lead with 60/40 lead-tin solder into the mix it softens the lead alloy a bit. It tends to splatter in a wider circle upon impact. Ergo leaving a larger wound channel in animals that one hunts.  I know the exit holes on door panels, wood, are much wider with softer slugs. Ignoring the lead fouling problem that comes with it. The tin content also explains why the civil war bullets didn't frost over so much as with normal full lead bullets. You can find older electronics with very little corrosion and the lead with tin flexes a bit in high vibration military electronics instead of cracking. (This is a problem with copper-tin solder at first when they switched composition) So my suggestion would be is to make a batch of differing bullets with solder into the mix before pouring the mold.  I would suggest a solid 60Pb/40Sn solder minnie ball or 90/10 lead-tin or a set of various ratios to see which sticks together on impact of each other.",2년 전,1,

@ellenmaclean-o9h,What about heat? Would the air resistance that slows the bullet to its terminal velocity also cause enough heating of the lead to cause it to be more malleable and able to fuse. I would assume that the distance from which the two fused bullets in the Smithsonian were fired was much greater than the 3 meters or so between the guns in the video. Would this increased distance and resulting longer time of air resistance cause enough heat to enable the fusion? Great video! Our whole family here in Germany love to watch your videos.

@TherealBagaluth,"First of all i am impressed. Outstanding work. I think i have the solution, why the lead of the bullets evapurates. It has nothing to do with other mixtures during the civil war and actual made bullets. The solution to keep the lead of the two bullets together and make them form a perfect donut ist friction of air. I bett, that the two bullets from the civil war had both at least 50 to 60 meters to travel from their musket muzzels to the meeting point in midair. The round about 100 to 150 m air between the two muzzels causes enough friction to slow both bullets down so much, that the energy in the meeting point was so reduced, that the lead was not foced in such a power, that it evapurated. It keeped together and mingeled even without the helping of your wallet in your test, that stopped the spreading sufficient enougt to keep more than 80 % of both bullets in the leadblock. Try again with more space between the muzzels. I think with the reduced powder of the actual settings 40 to 50 meter beween the muzzels should do. greetings Hein",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@TherealBagaluth,"One night sleep often helps to solve a puzzle. How to slow down the two bullets after they have left the muzzles so much, that the lead will only deform and not spread into thousends of fragments. On way is distance to let the friction of air do the work for you. But a biger distance between the muzzles causes a lot of other problems. So how to get more friction to get the energy out of the bullets? In your film you used plastic or paper cards to measure the way that  the bullets travel after leaving the muzzels.  If you use not one but 10 to 20 paper cards  all about two inch apart? That may cause so much friction that enough energy will be spend going through the paper cards. that the lead will stay together. You need to let the bullets travel about 20 inch before you place the first paper card to slow the bullet down. The space from one card to the next  should be at least 2 inch or you may cause a fire. It is a equation of energy and how to reduce the movement energy of the bullets after they have left the muzzels to the point where they meet in midair.",2년 전,0,

My grandfather helped build its signature wooden roller coaster “The Thunderbolt” but it also has a few really intense rides.   I love the engineering and physics of a roller coaster so much, and this park has some of the most modern type rides lined up alongside some of the true forerunners (The Jackrabbit is 103). It’s a historical site but also a true blue local attraction. I think fewer and fewer cities have anything comparable with Kennywood.

@gomezadams9900,I'm not an engineer but several things went through my ming while you were conducting this experiment. The gun powder is probably quite different from the powder they used during the war. Yes the lead was probably a little different too. The distance the bullets were shot from was probably a factor even though you attempted to address this in the loading of the powder in the bullets. The  artifact in the museum suggested that the shape of the bullet is very much what we would use today as apposed to the balls which were probably more common during the civil war. the actual shape and weight of the bullets used back then might also be a factor. These are just the thoughts that came to me mind while watching the playback on the slow motion video. It was still very cool to watch even if you failed to replicate the museum sample.,2년 전,0,

Smokeless powder combusts with a much higher velocity than black powder does, and so imparts more energy and power to the bullet. That's certainly part of the equation that y'all had figured out during testing.  I wonder if the other part of it was using a more impure lead.

@texasruss,I was blown away by how much thought you guys put into every aspect of the project. I thought “These guys are way smarter than me.” Then when you started firing the first rounds I was yelling at the TV. “Don’t forget to roll out some drop cloths to find the fragments on!” I guess you didn’t hear me because you were having to look through the grass. Ha ha! Great video.  I think about that original bullet impact though. Two soldiers lined up and took aim at each other. If one soldiers aim has been slightly off both would have died. I wonder if they survived the battle.,2년 전,0,
@nsttig777,"Great video. Try using similar but different bullets, unlikely the 2 people shooting at one another had the same calibre/ grain bullet. Maybe large vs small might do it might act more like a catchers mit and ball with the larger wraping around the smaller projectile.Also, You need to do this with base balls and make a second air cannon. Or regular cannons. Good luck with that though 😅 try aluminum/ brass bullets these won't ""splash"" and defragment as much I think. I really want to see this with a higher velocity round too but shield upgrades would be required. And don't assume BOTH bullets was fired. One could have hit the other in some unfortunate souls pocket that would have dislodged the casing, leaving only the projectiles to be found. Check to see if the civil war artifact has rifling is visible on both projectiles. And one last thing some smooth bore weapons were still used at this time so may not have even been through a rifles barrel. Notice the bullets hiting with opposite direction of rotation, this adds more moving parts to get nailed down. Again awesome video 👍🏻",2년 전,1,

@tacfoley4443,"You show a lot of jacketed bullets, with the jackets clearly visible in the off-centre hits near.  The sheer mass of the .58cal SOFT lead bullets, traveling at around 800 fps in opposing directions,wold ensure fusion.  Your 'little' bullets, made with modern HARD lead deliberatley to be shot FAST, are making around 1100/1200 fps almost straight out of the barrel, and are NEVER going to replicate that collision in the same way.  Physicist, Mr Taylor, down the page, notes '...  Black powder muskets had a typical velocity of 900 to 1000 feet per second, with a low ballistic coefficient, so they would slow down rapidly.  If there were something like 400 yards between the opposing battle lines, the bullets would have been traveling less than half the muzzle velocity at center path collision.'  Your bullets are making probably twice as much as this, with modern much harder lead in their makeup.

@McShavey,"Ah the old machinists demon strikes again.  From what I learned from the old heads at the paper mill I did my electrical apprenticeship at, I was doing a dual trade in instrumentation, and they used to get wandering calibrations on some of their instruments and it took them a little while to figure out what was going on.  A lot of the control equipment they used was pneumatic actuated and utilised PID control, with all the needle valves and such that go along with that kind of gear. They realised that the anchoring nuts and other bits that were supposed to lock the settings in these instruments were being affected by the general vibrations in the room from electrical motors and pumping equipment, and it was enough to cause some of them to loosen just enough that it would throw out the tuning on the control mechanisms, causing all kinds of headaches with poor and inaccurate readings and automation that wasn't automating.  So, they identified the problem. The solution?  Nail polish.  Usually bright pink or green or something easy to see. They'd put a bead of nail polish on the side of the nut and fasten it to housing so the setting was locked in place, but it was easy enough to remove with nail polish remover if it needed changing. It was perfect solution too because it could stand up to moisture, remained tacky enough to prevent it from cracking, and was a far better option than the various thread locking compounds that were designed for a more permanent bonding solution.  And that's why I now always keep a bottle of nail polish in my garage.",2년 전,0,

@notme8121,Well that was totally amazing obviously. I doubt you'll find this comment but I hope you do because I have plenty of questions or comments about it. First of all you didn't show how the protector saves one gun from getting shot by the other in case of a misfire. I was very interested in that. More importantly when you showed the 3D printed model of the gun it seemed to me that you should use the short cartridge full of powder but just cut off the back of the barrel so that the bullet sits in the rifling. Maybe there's more to it than the model showed but that looked like a simple solution to me. It seems like not filling the cartridge with powder made it inconsistent. Assuming the small cartridge full of powder to more consistent. I also thought of maybe mixing something inert with the powder to fill up the space but then that might not be consistent either. Anyway still amazing well-done glad you had fun I did too thank you,2년 전(수정됨),1,

@notme8121,I would really like to know how many rounds you fired and of them how many you liked. In other words what was your fire to like ratio? Also I think you might have to fire much much slower to get them to fuse and possibly change the LEAD composition. you can't pull the guns further apart so maybe cutting off a cartridge to make it very short and shortening the back of the barrel to do it. Seems like you need to fire a 45 with only the amount of powder a 22 short would use. But I really  really enjoyed it. I'm very curious to see what you do next. Thank you,2년 전,1,

It went plumb thru the scope without hitting the other internals of the scope. A one in a million shot at least and this is just like that in my humble opinion. One suggestion to see if the bullets will fuse is to load the shells with black powder instead of modern day smokeless powder. That is what they used back in the Civil War days and it doesn't have as much oomph as the modern day powder.,2년 전(수정됨),0,

Maybe the pressure gauge simply reads the difference between the air and the tyre say the tyre is at 1.6 and the air at 1 therfore ot reads at 0.6 but then why does it do that? Why not say 1.6?

I love your topics and stuff, but with most channels I enjoy long winded explanations, but, you take the part everybody wants to see and put it late in the video and it seems like it’s just trying to keep the listener engaged but it doesn’t work for me. Don’t show the main shot and then cut it right before, that’s annoying man. Just a big fan’s constructive criticism. Sometimes the way you tell stories seems self serving and long winded as opposed to telling the story in an engaging manner. Sometimes going over details that are really obvious, or whole sections that don’t need explained. Much love. (This doesn’t apply to this video only and specifically, it applies to all of your content as I’ve been watching over years). It’s like the things that I would prefer you to explain, you don’t even touch on (sometimes the more complicated explanations, or things that require background knowledge), but the things that I already have heard about a million times from other sources you explain at length.

@Sertao2013,"The  Minie balls were 58 calibers and 500 grains  with a BC of 160  with a mv of  right around  900 fps  to 1,000  fps  with about 60 grains of black power . That's right at  899.52 fpe  mv  at 900 fps mv   According how far they traveled before they hit each other that could have been  0 yards to up to 250  yards will be the balls fpe on impact  The lead had to produce enough fpe  to fuse together .  If the mv was 900 fps  you are looking at between 900 to 727 fps from 0 to 250 yards  and 899 to 587  fpe from  0 to 250 yards . So Its going to be in that range .   Even at 1,000 yards the bullet is still going  415 fps and still has 191 fpe . I'm guessing the 2 bullets would have had to have been at least 1,000 yards apart   to only mushroom together  . Any closer and they would have exploded the bullets into fragments .      The easiest way to figure this out is to  shoot a 58 caliber pure lead ball with a mv of around 900 fps and shoot at a pure lead plate .   Back then they used pure led so they could  pour it over a open camp fire . Start off at 10 yards  and walk back till you get the ball to mushroom out against the lead plate .   The best way without using gun power  would be to use a 50 caliber  pcp air rifle  that you can change the  mv .with a twist of the dial .  You can dial the  mv   from 1,000 fps down to as slow as it needs to be to make the lead  mushroom together without breaking apart .   Once you know  the mv  and fpe on impact  needed to do this it will be a good start to  making them fuse together .    The pcp air rifles  are very precise and very accurate. With a chronograph you can dial both guns to fire the lead bullets at the same  mv . I think this would be the fastest and cheapest way to  figure out  fpe needed . Because  you can use a pcp that has a built in regulator  each shot  will be the same mv  .   You can take a hundreds shots if you connect the guns to a  carbon tank  that can be refilled on the spot with a pcp air compressor   or just use a few tanks . Its more accurate than gun power .  Talk to the good people at Airforce Airguns they will even help you out to make this happen .   Once you get them to mushroom together  you will know how far away they were  from each other when  both ball were shot. It would be cool to know how far they were from each other  when they both were shooting at each other  . I bet they both wondered why they missed and why they were not  hit from the other  musket . Were they close enough to know they could not have missed ? Did they both think they forgot to load a ball in the heat of the battle ?  Were they feet apart  or 1,000 yards apart ? I wonder if they both  lived to fight another day or did the next reload  end a life .",2년 전(수정됨),0,

Just inside there were saveral display cabinets with collections of bullets collected from the battlefields.  There were shoeboxes full of plain minnie ball slugs of different calibers.  In the middle was a small box with maybe 12 to 14 pairs of slugs that hit and fused together in flight.  They were mostly complete, no splattered lead.

@theaberrantdon,"I'm only part of the way through the video, but I see one of the problems you are having. Store bought lead bullets will be made of an alloy to make the bullet harder. That makes the bullet more  brittle. You will want to try a pure lead bullet. That will be more maliable and less brittle. It should also be much more likely to fuse together. You could also take some of the guesswork out of your loading procedures by figuring out the muzzle velocity of the rifles that fired the original fuzed bullets, then figuring out what the velocity would be at a distance you would expect for battles of that time. You could then load to that velocity and do your adjustments from there to account for error in the distance and loading estimates. Also, the miniball shape may have played a part in how the bullets folded together.",2년 전,0,

@Doramius,"Someone may have already said this, but your velocity is too high.  To replicate, you probably want to check the velocity of a mini-ball from a black powder rifle, and try to reduce your powder in the casings to try and match the lower velocity.  Too much energy is being expelled at the high speed, and MUST go somewhere...causing the massive shattering.  The ridge wallet effect worked as you added a medium that absorbed energy at impact, equating to lower velocity impact energy.  Another similar effect is firing bullets into water, they will shatter at high speeds and not get very deep.  Reduce the velocity, and they will go farther in water, and they're energy can cause damage deeper.  IE: High velocity rifle ammunition vs bow & arrow fired into water.  Set a foam target in 4 feet of water and see which one make it to the target, and which one disintegrates before making it halfway to the target.",2년 전,0,

Also I didn’t watch the full video as I don’t have the time right now so I don’t know if this was covered later but, I heard the part where you wanted them to fuse together like they have them in the museums from the civil war, but instead are exploding. That may be because back then they mostly used pure lead to cast their bullets, of course not all of them as around that time they were experimenting with other bullet types, coatings, alloys, velocities etc.. but pure lead is much more malleable and softer than the lead alloys we have now in modern bullets, so harder lead alloys are going to fragment and shatter more than pure lead will.",2년 전(수정됨),5,

@aperson9495,"It's probably been said (can't really read through 18,000 comments lol), but part of why your shot exploded and the civil war rounds fused could well be related to metallurgy - The lead bullets from the civil war were likely a different lead alloy vs what you used today, resulting in the difference in results (with your first collision). Edit3: and then you touched on both of those points later on in the video after I commented lol.  Edit: Another aspect could be distance... Of course at any significant distance, the odds of such a shot are astronomical, and the one in the museum, well, the odds of such shot really can't be calculated, I suspect, but you're firing from really close range, so you have more than enough energy to fuse them at that point, to the point where there's TOO MUCH energy I suspect.  Edit2: Yes, jumping to the lands vs being on the lands will cause accuracy issues - when handloading for precision, you typically load specific rounds for a specific firearm, with the the bullet seated to a depth that is a specific distance off the lands (or just touching them) for consistency,",2년 전(수정됨),1,

@blainetaylor8718,"What a great video and narrative!  As an 80 year old physicist with a lifelong interest in ballistics, I have a couple of comments;  The muzzle loading rifles of civil war era used a much different rifling twist than modern ammunition.  The use of hollow base or ""mini Ball"" bullets rammed down a bore require a much different idea for stabilization.  The lead composition is very, very  soft so that the hollow base can expand to fit the bore tightly and engage the rifling without causing so much loading drag.  Many of the muskets used in civil war time were smooth bore, without any rifling.  Stabilizing the bullets in a smooth bore required a round ball , or in later years a Mini Ball with a hollow base or skirt.  Modern air rifles also achieve stabilization partly through the skirt stabilization.  If you compute the total energy of a bullet, it is not just ""1/2 mv squared"" of linear energy, but has a rather large rotational energy due to the rifling twist.  In a head on collision, this rotational energy is in opposition for the two bullets,  To achieve true linear energy transfer, you would either have to have the two bullets rotating in opposite vector direction, or not rotating at all.  For reference, a 45 colt is commonly rifled at a 1 turn every 16 inches, wheras the muzzle loading rifles ranged from smooth bore (no twist) to 1 turn every 5 to 10 feet.   My suggestion is to change the rifling to very long twist, in opposition, and use a pure lead bullet if you really want to see a fused bullet.  The other factor is velocity.  Black powder muskets had a typical velocity of 900 to 1000 feet per second, with a low ballistic coefficient, so they would slow down rapidly.  If there were something like 400 yards between the opposing battle lines, the bullets would have been traveling less than half the muzzle velocity at center path collision.  You might try to fire a pure lead bullet at a steel plate and determine the amount of deformation of that bullet then take half the linear energy backed out to velocity as a starting point for your powder charge and velocity starting point.  Modern large bore pneumatic or air rifles might be an easier and more controllable medium to base your configuration on.    Again i want to emphasize what a marvelous presentation you have made!!!",2년 전,624,

@jean-pauliribarren5700,"Edit: as @DROW RANGER pointed out, there's a big mistake in the numbers below: one rev is 2*Pi radians, not the opposite. Please check the end of this message for correct (and astonishing) values.  Regarding rifling, I did a couple back-of-the-envelope computations, and if my numbers are correct, standard rifling values actually result in a high amount of rotational energy. Assuming 1000 ft/s linear velocity, 1 turn every 16 inches, and converting to SI units (I rounded numbers a bit):  rifling = 1 rev / 0.38 m linear speed = 300 m/s rot speed = 1 rev / 1.27 ms rot speed = 790 rev/s rot speed (omega) = 125.7 rad/s <== this is incorrect bullet radius (r) = 0.0057 m normal accel = r * omega² = 90 m/s² (at bullet periphery) => close to 9 g  Therefore, just after impact, molten lead experiments a centrifugal accel as high as 9 g. This may be the main cause for the corona shaped dispersion of molten lead and other bullet fragments. @Blaine Taylor is probably on the right path when he suggests using either a smooth bore or a very long twist value to limit dispersion and to fuse both bullets with each other.  Edit: since 1 rev = 2*Pi radians, the correct maths are:  rifling = 1 rev / 0.38 m linear speed = 300 m/s rot speed = 1 rev / 1.27 ms rot speed = 790 rev/s rot speed (omega) = 4963.7 rad/s bullet radius (r) = 0.0057 m normal accel = r * omega² = 140440 m/s² (at bullet periphery) => close to 14300 g  The erroneous computation already gave a respectable value with 9 g, but the correct maths show a MIGHTY normal accel value with those 14300 g!",2년 전(수정됨),12,

@ГригорийНазаров-ь2г,"My guess it's both metal and velocity. Lead in original bullets might have been much softer. Also it might have been heated by the shot. Speaking of velocity, probably any barrel escape velocity is too big for the fusion, so my suggestions are water or ballistic gelatin. You won't need too much of that. I'll also add two points.  First, you can test much simpler setup of shooting one bullet against steel wall. Because it's almost what they will get through when perfectly collided. Thus you will eliminate issues with them exploding.  Second point, it might be that the original bullets didn't actually collide midair. After all, no one will search battlefield for some bullets. So my bet it was, unfortunately, someone's body. Which also helped to keep bullet pieces together. And that's why it was found.

High-caliber, long-barrel muskets used in the Civil War fired extremely slow rounds.  If you compound that with distance, you could probably have watched those bullets approach each other with the naked eye because they were going so slowly.  Get much larger and longer barrels to remove as much energy from the rounds as possible and increase the distance as much as possible.  Your problem is the linear momentum.  The force required to fire those rounds far exceeds the force required to destroy the round.  You have relatively small caliber pistol rounds.  They don't have the mass to absorb such energy.  Test larger rounds against a stationary, bullet-proof target at the farthest range you can accurately shoot until you find a round that distorts as little as possible on impact.",2년 전,1,

@holl0918," @raidermaxx2324  Just load the cartridges with a smaller quantity of  less dense powder w/ a heavier bullet. .45 Colt wasn't the best choice for this test because it is a naturally spacious cartridge, being designed for black powder. If you loaded a .45LC full of an appropriate smokeless powder your average .45LC revolver would explode, and we want slower not faster. The bullets designed for .45LC are usually in the 250gr range at between 950 and 1100fps from a revolver barrel, depending on the load. You could soft-cast a 500gr+ .45-70 bullet, then swage it down from .457 to .452, and fire it at only 600fps (or less). This would take up the excess room in the case with the larger bullet (consistant velocity) and help reduce the velocity (heavier projectile, less propellant). It would also increase the projectile length, allowing the bullet more time to splash everywhere and decelerate before running out of bullet. Remember, if both guns are firing at 1000fps, impact velocity is 2000fps (assuming minimal deceleration, we're at point blank here.) KE=1/2MV^2. Kinetic energy scales with the square of the velocity, meaning that 2000fps has 4x the KE of 1000fps. Reducing the velocity is key here.",2년 전(수정됨),1,
@raidermaxx2324," @holl0918  what would ""curving both  barrels"" do,  as opposed to having two straight barrels pointed at each other? Any effect on physics you think ?",2년 전(수정됨),1,
@holl0918," @raidermaxx2324  It would reduce the velocity due to the added friction of the bullet pressing against the barrel walls and deforming. The barrel would have to be made thicker than usual to handle the excess stress all concentrated along the outside of the curve, otherwise the pressure imballance would just punch a hole in the barrel. The bullet would exit the barrel slightly bent, and would travel in a strait line as soon as it left the barrel as there is no longer anything forcing it to change direction. Think of a ball or a yoyo on a string. If you spin it around your head and let it go, it will just fly strait off in whatever direction it what traveling at the time you released the string. The bullet would do the same, traveling strait out the muzzle just as in a strait barrel... at least until the air resistance acting on the slight bend imparted by the curvature of the barrel and the spin from the rifling cause it to destabilize and tumble. It would accomplish the task of reducing the velocity, but introduce a whole bunch of much more unpredictable engineering hurdles.",2년 전(수정됨),1,

@burninpwder76,You are on the right track the lead composition of civil war minnie balls was a lot different than modern lead bullet composition. Also most of the civil war minnie balls were 58 or 69  caliber so you are dealing with more mass than a 45 long colt projectile. 460 to 500 grains for the minnie ball Vs around 255 for the heavier 45 lc loadings. (you didn't say what weight projectiles you were loading). the addition of alloy metals to modern lead bullets tend to make them more brittle at impact. The softer lead and greater mass of the original minnie balls would likely make for a greater chance of actual bullet fusion at point of impact. Good luck with further tests. I would like to see you actually fuse 2 bullets.,2년 전,0,

You can pull on CF super hard (like in a cable for a space elevator, not that it's actually strong enough for that, but is stronger than steel in that way) and it'll be fine, but if you hit it with a hammer without even really going for it and it shatters. Of course that is more true of traditional weaved CF than the forged CF my wallet has, but still applies to each individual bit of forged CF where the fibers are oriented roughly in the same directly as they all are in the weaved variety, and the part that isn't fiber, is just still resin / plastic in both. CF is much more like a super strong string / rope that we then embed in plastic to use for 3D objects to make them better under tension than steel, but under compression, it's still just plastic and the side of that same super strong string / rope.",2년 전,0,

@wittsullivan8130,"Your velocity might be too high. Normally .45 Colt is fired through a revolver, which has a gap between the barrel and the cylinder, allowing some gases to escape. your rig has a solid chamber and barrel, so there's no bleed off. Also, revolvers have a forcing cone that acts like a funnel for the bullet to squeeze down to just above the bore size, so the bullet can bite into the rifling. The forcing cone and the rifling add friction, which also slows the bullet down. This also allows for different tolerances from the machining process, no two barrels are identical. Longer barrels can actually slow bullets, depending on how the ammo was loaded, which is why a lot of precision shooters use custom loads for their guns.  During the Civil War, the soldiers were 80-100 yards from each other, which could slow the bullets down some. When you have hundreds of soldiers shooting nearly simultaneously at each other, weird things happen. If you're not first, you're last. It was the Quick or the Dead.",2년 전,0,

@wittsullivan8130,"There are a few things. On both sides of the late Civil War, soldiers used British Enfield musket rifles and Springfield musket rifles. The South used paper cartridges supplied by the British with a Pritchett hollow based bullet or a minie style bullet, also hollow based. The cartridges were loaded with 60 grains of musket powder. The way the Minie bullet works, the base of the bullet flares out upon firing to engage the rifling and mostly seal the gases so it's more efficient. The bullet is also very stable from the shape of the bullet and the gyroscopic effect from the rifling. The bullet is going about 1000 fps. The bullets they used were also pure lead.  Modern cast bullets have some other metals mixed in like tin and antimony, so the bullets are harder on the Rockwell scale, which also makes them brittle. Hard bullets fragment when they hit hard objects, like steel plates or other hard bullets going the same speed. Pure lead bullets can be deformed by dropping them from waist height on concrete or even hard wood.  Another option to .45 Colt would be .45 Schofield, which uses a case about an eight of an inch shorter. The reason they call .45 Colt ""Long Colt"" is the US Army fielded Colt Single Action Army revolvers and supplemented them with Smith and Wesson revolvers, designed by a guy named Schofield. For some reason (maybe the weaker frame design?) they made the Schofield ammo a little bit shorter. So if you had a Colt revolver, it could chamber either round, but the Smith and Wesson couldn't chamber .45 Colt, so soldiers started calling the .45 Colt round .45 ""Long Colt"".  Of course during the Civil War, they used blackpowder, which has different properties than modern smokeless powder. Blackpowder requires compression with no air space between the projectile and the powder or it becomes explosive instead of a propellant. Smokeless powder increases chamber pressure if you compress the powder with the bullet, so you want a gap between powder and bullet. Different smokeless powders have different burn rates and different primers have different ignition times.",2년 전,0,

@wilfredocolon9827,"In order to do this safely and correctly, you professionals took the most dangerous and least effective path to your goal.  A.  You built an open air facility to photograph the phenomenon.  The better course of action would have been to place the barrels a few inches apart and completely enclose the impact zone in a printed plastic enclosure.  The barrels could themselves be printed by using one long boring tube that builds both barrels out of the enclosure itself.  This achieves two things.  The barrels are perfectly aligned to each other and they are reproducible out of polycarbonate thermoplastic.  If you damage the chamber, you simply print and bore out another.  B.  The high speed must be inside the enclosure in order to capture the phenomenon.  It's lens must be protect from impact.  A large polycarbonate protection filter can be placed in front of the lends that would protect the camera from shrapnel exposure.  C.

@frebirdstil1godsson691,"Super cool video !!!😁👍...🤔so the casing length regarding the powder arrangement and the distance from the nose of the bullet to the beginning of the twist...couple thoughts..1,the size shape, and the burn rate of the different powders available. Some of the powders may burn better in a Loosely packed environment versus a tightly packed one or vice versa given that there are different burn rate powders, there are different shapes, and sizes, cylindrical, disc-shaped, and so on. Thought num2, that Gap in between the nose of the bullet and the rifling is called headspace, I'm no expert by any means however my reloading books specify a specific headspace for any given load. Something that they all seem to have in common is that there is a specified space there meaning the nose of the bullet should not come in contact with the rear of the rifling when seated in the chamber because they say that can cause unsafe head pressures. And too much head space would absolutely allow for energy loss out of that Gap. Also thinking maybe modern-day bullet materials and Manufacturing processes may pose a problem with trying to get the two bullets to fuse. Would be awesome too figure out exactly what the Civil War bullets were doing for velocity, and the exact composition of the projectile. During the Civil War, were they good clean manufactured lead bullets, or could people have been possibly melting down whatever they could get their hands on?? In that time period were there riflings in their barrels or were they smoothbore?? I would tend to think if you had two identical twist barrels facing each other the bullets are going to be spinning opposite directions which would kind of make them want to spin off of each other when they hit in my mind. I almost imagine u would have to have 2, slow moving, heavy, soft lead projectiles with no spin meeting head-on in order to make them fuse..??? 😆😁fun conversation 👍🤘 keep being awesome and having fun, later dudes God bless✌️",2년 전,0,

@jwstaddo,If you use historically accurate blsck powder it burns MUCH slower and accelerates the bullet through the barrel. The highest speed will be as it exits the barrel. So you get a slow speed without the bullet getting stuck in the barrel. Its common for black powder guns to fire bits of unburned powder out the end of the barrel if you put too much powder in.. When that happens the bullet starts to loose power since the excess powder is absorbing some of the energy.  For your project precisely timing a slow burn with black powder may not be posdible however.,2년 전,0,

@tobyshipley3078,I think the velocity of the bullets are too high to fuse. It must be considered that in the civil war people weren’t shooting at each other from 2 meters away. The same goes for the two bullets that fused during WW1. During WW1 trenches were 50 to 250 yards apart. I think the bullets that fused were travelling much slower because they were fired far away from one another.,2년 전,0,

The Lady in the office said that people visiting the site over the years have found most of the bullets while walking around the monument.

Muskets were muzzle loading and the bullets were tamed down the barrel by hand with a ram rod.

@amrshehab7019,great video but at the end it didn't make a fusion of the two bullets like the one in world war and i kept thinking of what could happen in the world war and you didn't do in the video especially when i knew that the bullet in the world war is also from lead which i thought at first might be the reason as i thought lead is  brittle but i found that it is not it is from the most no-brittle material exists that means it is not easy to fracture that way like in the video so it is very hard to know how to fuse them without fracturing but i believe it is one of two reasons no third  1) it might be that one degree angle make the force line of action deviates from the axial direction of the bullet making them unfused but fractures first before heat is transferred due to loss of kinetic energy and the interface between them is melted and they mix then cooled again to fuse  2) may be something about the speed and the way the bullet exit from the gun you made which is of course different from the actual guns used   so if you accept an advice from me if you want to fuse them you can try  1) to make them at zero angle and for safety you can make the barrier hole is exactly the same as the bullet size so that if the bullets didn't deviate at all it will sure hit the second bullet but if it deviates a little bit it will hit the barrier and things are not dangerous. 2) to see the type of guns that actually used in world war and the velocity at the exit from the gun and make your calculation well to design your gun to have the same exit velocity and also i don't know if guns at world war has that thing that makes the bullet spin so if you know try to make as much as you can a similar gun or in other word a gun that make the bullet exit with the same conditions,2년 전,0,

@43zthang,"Destin, great video. As usual, it was both entertaining and educational. I have a couple suggestions on how to make your two bullets fuse together, since I have a fair amount of experience in testing bullets against various objects.   - Velocity needs to be lower, but consistent. To that end I suggest asking your reloading friend to use Trail Boss powder; it's specifically made for larger capacity cases like the 45 Long Colt - it is a low density powder so that you get good case fill with more consistent velocity. You can safely use a full case of Trail Boss, but you'll want to use significantly less for this experiment.  - I recommend targeting about 500-550 fps; below that you probably will have too much trouble with consistent velocity. It might be worth measuring velocity from each barrel individually; they may not be the same. You also could adjust crimps and seating depth to get the most consistent values. (Some chronographs, like the CED ProChrono DLX, will send the data straight to your smartphone and give you statistics like standard deviation right there.) - Lead alloy needs to be as close to pure lead as you can get, to keep it malleable. If your reloading friend wants to cast the bullets from pure lead, he'll need to set the pot temperature hotter than usual to get the bullets to fill out well in the mold, or add a tiny percentage (less than 0.5%) of tin. Be aware that too much tin and/or antimony make the alloy less malleable, which is why your bullets shatter rather than fusing together. - If you want to use commercial bullets, buy muzzle loader bullets; these are typically pure or nearly pure lead, much like an old Minie ball. Another option is to use muzzle loader round balls, either .452"" or a larger diameter sized down for more bearing surface. These are also nearly pure lead and should fuse together better than the bullets you tried in the video above. If nothing else, these will expand and come apart on contact in a different way than the more brittle hard cast bullets; I expect you'll see more of a ""splash"" and less ""shatter"" if that makes sense.  I hope that helps!",2년 전,15,

@droolgrewa5451,"I don't comment on yt videos, but I feel like I have to get this out there so smart people than me can disprove it.   I think the two bullets fused together because they melted the aluminum just enough to be the bonding agent.   Those look to be led rounds and not full metal jacket. Led has a melting point around 1900degC and aluminum around 650degC. The two around hitting the thin aluminum from both sides at the same time transferred enough kinetic energy to melt or soften the aluminum just enough to fuse the bullets at the contact point.   This may work better with a full metal jacket round since copper metals around 330degC. The thin layer on the rounds themselves is not enough and fragments too fast to provide enough material for the fusion.   However a fmj round shot at aluminum (or copper) the same way might give a more consistent result due lower melting points of the metals, and a larger surface area (aluminum or copper) of the sheet (wallet) providing more material as the bonding agent.   TLDR: the kinetic energy from the two rounds coming in contact with the aluminum at the same time may have melted and then fused the two rounds together.",2년 전,0,

@Jamndude3,"There is one more variable that I think needs to be considered for getting the bullets to fuse like you wanted.   Civil War Era long arms wouldn't be used at such  short distances from each other.  These weapons were mostly muzzle loaded and took an experienced soldier about 20 seconds to reload.  If you were close enough to just rush the front line in under 20 seconds,  they wouldn't order to fire, they'd call for a bayonet charge.  The fused bullets were probably fired from much farther apart, giving air friction time to bleed out energy before impact,  much like how they lost energy when traveling through your wallet. To get a similar effect without increasing the distance you would need something to create drag on the bullets, but that might make aiming more difficult just increasing the distance.  The only thing I could come up with was using a ballistic gel target, but the impact interface will certainly mess with the shot...",2년 전,0,

@ctdieselnut,"Id like a statistician to calculate the odds  of how many shots need to be fired to expect to have at least one mid air bullet collision, precise enough for them to stick together during  the civil war. Say, 2 lines of 500 men a piece, on level ground, 200(?) yards apart, all shooting 3(?) shots a min at each other (rate of a muzzle loader?).  This sounds perfect for r/theydidthemath. I would start with finding  the area of the targets, and divide them by the area of the tip of a bullet. After that, see how much time it takes a bullet to make it from one side to the other, (and vice versa would be the same). Then, multiply the odds of a shot being fired from each side within the same time it takes to cover the distance (so the two fired simultaneously would be in the air at the same time) by the number of possible points of impact.   I could plug in some numbers and see what I come up with, but i wonder if anyone will read this and immediately find a flaw with my method?",2년 전,0,

@ctdieselnut,"Heres what i came up with. Civil war rifles: 1500fps(more like 1200-1400, but lets just say), .75 cal bullets  2 sides in lines of 500 each, facing each other 200 yrds apart (effective range 200-400yds)  Each man is 6', and averages 2' wide. All standing shoulder to shoulder like a wall, all shots targeted and hit this 'wall'.  Given the speed and distance, the bullets actually take .4 of a second to cover the 200yd gap, 1000 men firing muzzle loaders at 3 rounds a min equals 3000 shots per minute.   Area of each man wall divided by possible shot placements with no overlap is is almost 2m possible points of impact(or possible  trajectories).   Ill save you all the numbers, but amazingly with that rate of fire(3 per min each) times 1000 men means at any given time theres an average of 20 bullets in flight, 10 from each side. There's 4 chances per second it could theoretically happen.  Ill spare you all the numbers, but i came up with a mid air bullet collision is around 1:9.5 trillion.   I could be off by a factor of 100, and it would still be amazing. Its probably a higher number than that, this was 2 bullets coliding within the same square inch (not dead on), soldiers don't stand broadside shoulder to shoulder towards the enemy, musket accuracy was abysmal, i averaged and assumed numbers/times/distances/sizes, etc. Yet it still happened, at least once by accident(that we know of, with the certainty of having recovered the fused bullets) and at least once for yt lol.

I'd expect the real reason has more to do with velocity loss because of air resistance of the original bullets, as a result of distance between the two shooters. They dropped to a point where the two bullets could collide and not explode, without causing a squib load.  That would be SO hard to test though.  Quick edit: actually this would be easy to test, as you just need the velocity to drop. You could literally just use sheets of paper to lower the velocity ahead of the collision point... You'd probably want to anchor them down so they don't move though. That could cause the bullets to drift.",2년 전(수정됨),15,
@johanwamokolobetsi6094,I think that there is nothing wrong with the lead that is used but that it is oxidised and has a coating on it and the time they fused together the oxide layer had been removed but tie initial impact on the target giving them the added help to adhere together  yes a different composition of lead would be easier I think if you could use swaged lead projectiles rather than cast the results should be attainable faster   There is a vast difference between swaged and cast that may be a key factor I thoroughly enjoy all your videos thankyou for taking the time to make them,2년 전,0,

@letsdosomething6691,"34:00 This ridge wallet shot makes me wonder, if you were to break open the two bullets at the museum, would you find something in between them like clothes, metal, wood, dirt, possibly even DNA if you know what I mean. This would have been a battle field after all. It's possible that there was a person between the two guns and their clothes or possibly even, unfortunately, their body allowed the two bullets to slow down and be enclosed enough to fuse and not explode. The external forces on the bullet provided by a body, clothes, or tree could be enough to contain the entirety of the two bullets and allow them to fully fuse as seen in the museum. When you look at the museum bullet they are rounded in the middle all the way around almost as if they were inside something when they hit each other. like the water vortex video, the edges are round and curling back. that video was water jets inside water. Two materials with similar or identical densities. You are shooting lead in air. Two very different densities and the bullets explode because of it. If they met inside something with a more similar density to lead I think you might find exactly the result you are looking for. It would be interesting to test this theory by having them meet inside clear ballistics gel, thick period accurate clothing, or a block of wood. Heck you might even prove the museum doesn't have the full story. What are the chances of that?;) Chances are no one will read this comment but if you do I'm interested to know what you think and if you agree this should be tested.

As far as getting that fusion you're looking for, I think you will have to fire from a much farther distance and use air friction to slow the bullets down enough that they don't explode on contact. That or painstakingly fine-tune and test the amount of grains so that you use some of the friction from the barrel to slow them down to the perfect speed, but even then there would be some variables that would create inconsistencies in testing that you'll just have to get close enough and just keep missing until you don't.

The final thing to consider is the speed at impact. in the CW the typical distance between firing lines is? (assume 50 yards?) you may need to use an alternate launching system",2년 전,0,

@wienerwoods,"Try using less powder for a slower muzzle velocity guys. Higher velocity results in more fragmentation as the lead is unable to maintain it's structural integrity as the kinetic energy of each projectile is absorbed by it's opposite and re-directed perpendicular to it's original vector in the form of a pressure wave of heat. Lower velocity = less heat and pressure at impact, less heat and pressure at impact = lower terminal heat in each projectile. Less heat = more material cohesion = less fragmnetation.  Think of each bullet as an anvil from the perspective of the other bullet, and the powder charge as the hammer smashing it into the anvil:  If you want to shatter the bullet against the anvil, you'd pick the biggest sledge hammer in your toolbox with the longest handle and you'd wack that bullet with it as hard as you could. Lead is extremely ductile at room tempeture. The melting point of lead is only 621 degrees F. when you hit the bullet with your giant steel sledgehammer against a giant steel anvil, most of the energy in the head of the hammer is going to be transferred into the anvil after passing through the bullet.   The ""lost"" energy will go into plastic deformation of the bullet in the form of heat caused by the impact of the hammer and the pressure wave this creates as it compresses first the bullet, then the anvil. If this heat is high enough, the bullet will fragment as the lead is stressed past the limits of Pb's elastic and then plastic deformation point (yield point) under loading. These limits are dictated by a combination of the material properties of the Pb bullet, It's mass and initial temperture, the amount of energy put into the system, the time over which this energy is delived, the direction from which it comes (vector) and the geometric shape of the bullet. If the loading (energy) comes axially and symmetrically, and heats up the bullet enough, it will first permenantly deform past it's elastic limit, then litterally dis-integrate past it's plastic limit due to thermal and mechanical stress as it transfers as much of the hammer's energy into the anvil as it's capable of transferring before structural failure.   In this case structual failure occurs through fragmentation / shattering.   If you want to deform the bullet without shattering it, you need to put less energy into the system. The aluminum wallet absorbed enough energy from the projectile(s) to allow them to partially fuse rather than completely shatter. You need to load the Pb above it's yeild point to achieve ductile failure, but below it's plastic deformation limit.  There is a wide margin between plastic deformation and complete structural failure in ductile materials like lead. It's within this margin that those two civil war bullets fused instead of shattering. What's truly amazing is that they were fired on a battlefield at almost perfectly recipricol balistic trajectories, meeting at what appears to be the apex of both projectile's flight, with perfectly symmetrical / reciprocol azimuths and elevations.  Very spooky - but given the number of combatants (over 200,000) and the number of bullets flying (hundreds of millions ) in a relatively small area ( 5 mile front defined by the Rappahaunic River) it's certainly not impossible. My guess is that the fused bullets came from oposing firing Minie balls hundreds of yards from one another more or less simultaneiously.   At the start of the battle the armies squared off a mile or so apart from each other over the river, and no doubt millions of bullets were fired at the start of the battle by each side as they closed with each other. The real question is where the fused bullets were found exactly. That might give some clue as to the range at which they were fired, and thus the energy with which they met. If S.E.D. can replicate the fusion through energy management, they should be able make an educated forensic guess as to how far apart the guns that fired them were, and that might narrow down where the bullets came from.

@Pierobon,"Hey Destin, what happens if the bullet flies a longer distance before meeting? Will the lead be colder or hotter before impact? Of course, it will be slower... But is the speed and chemic the only thing here? Can the bullet temperature variation be calculated for every few centimetre it flew, and if the air heated or cooled it? Maybe it is possible to induction-heat 100 or maybe even 500 degrees the barrel with the bullet inside before firing, to compensate for the little distance and little air friction heating up? Or somehow shoot it from further apart, so it will be even slower when they meet...  My blind guess is that they have to heat up more, AND slow down a lot more to fuse successfully. But then, who am I to know for sure? Would definitely patreonize if not currently unemployed. Follow your channel for years already, this time you went beyond awesome!",2년 전,0,

You are using 20th century firearms, ignition, and projectile technology in an attempt to replicate a 19th century phenomenon which used 18th and 19th Century firearms, ignition and projectile technology.  - Civil war era firearms all used Black Powder. Modern smokeless powder was not invented until the 1890's.  - A great percentage of Civil War long guns and pistols used muzzle loaded projectiles. In fact, many of the long guns were muskets, which shot  cloth patched round balls through smooth bore barrels. Muskets have no rifling to set the projectile spinning.. - Most modern ""Lead"" ammunition is not pure lead. It is a lead and antimony mix, which stiffens and hardens the bullet, making it more likely to fragment upon contact with something hard, like bone....or another bullet!

@Nexinator,"I think fusion will occur when the diameter&length is increased of each bullet and velocity decreased (from modern guns). Also, the rifling may have been more/less in the older guns, so the rotational aspect of each bullet rotating versus each other might (and I use this very sparingly) have an effect. Consider fusion welding. Check the difference between degrees of rotation per 20 (picked a random number here) yards of each. Match them up if you can! Good luck.",2년 전,6,

@bobnesler4271,"The two fused bullets in the Smithsonian may be .58 caliber minie balls, which were mostly cast from pure lead, without the hardeners used in modern lead bullets. (Zinc, tin and antimony are used to harden the lead in order to prevent ""leading"" of the rifling.)  But the minie balls of the civil war rifled muskets, such as the .58 Springfield and the .577 Enfield, used a 530-grain bullet with a hollow base to create obturation when the black powder charge behind it exploded, causing the soft lead skirt of the hollow base to spread into the rifling, sealing the expanding gas (obturation).   Your bullets may be shattering like glass because they contain modern hardening agents.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

My person thought is your bullet lead is to hard. (Harder material causes fragmentation softer material mashes together). The only way to truly duplicate the event is to know the chemical make up of the lead bullet and the exact powder chemistry used in that war. Then you can get closer to the fusion of the two bullets.  @KnuckleHunkybuck makes a valid point you are using short barrels and in the war they used long barrels.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@gergelymolnar1661,"It is a wild guess, but it looks like from the videos that the bullets are fractured/fragmented compared to the old ones from the museum, where most of the kinetic and potential energy is dissipated in a ductile manner. Which means, that after the collision there wasn't enough elastic energy left in the material for the reflecting waves to separate the two pices. While in these present day experiments too much energy was transformed into fracture... Probably shooting the bullets with a smaller initial velocity and finding a ""softer"" metal with a higher fracture toughness and a smaller yield strength will do the trick! Keep up the good work!

@tobyshipley3078,I think the velocity of the bullets are too high to fuse. It must be considered that in the civil war people weren’t shooting at each other from 2 meters away. The same goes for the two bullets that fused during WW1. During WW1 trenches were 50 to 250 yards apart. I think the bullets that fused were travelling much slower because they were fired far away from one another.,2년 전,1,

The solder need to have in its composition one atom that match with the pieces of metal. For exemple when you work with copper, you can use silver soldering because it have copper in it.  Maybe you could try that… An other thing is the composition of the bullets. I don’t know what you use but maybe try to use bullets whose fusion point is lower. Silver have a pretty low fusion point( around 900 C) and you can mix it with other metals to lower even more the fusion point. ( that’s the principle of soldering) I hope you can find some ideas in all this. Good luck for the total fusion😉",2년 전,1,

@YOUneedJESUS1,Anneal the lead. Heat them up to almost melting (550 to 600°F) then burry them in warm sand (100 to 120°F) for 24hrs. Most lead bullets are hard cast. Meaning a light heat treat to prevent barrel fouling. Then shoot for 400 fps. Use a 2in barrel helps drop fps. Then bobs your uncle,2년 전(수정됨),0,

@Texlex61,"I'm skeptical that the fused bullets happened from a midair direct impact. Your tests seem to show that they're much more likely to shatter. Could the fused slugs have been caused, instead, by loading two slugs tip-to-tip into the same barrel and shooting them into some medium that would not destroy them (e.g., water, mud, flesh, etc.)? Wouldn't that approximately halve the impact momentum while tending to keep the two slugs perfectly aligned? Also, with both penetrating into the medium at the same time, the medium itself might resist the tendency  of the slugs to shatter.",2년 전,0,

@JoshuaHorn,"Great video! I've seen a couple of those fused bullets in museums, they are really amazing artifacts. You may already have this all figured out, but I had a few thoughts on why the bullets didn't fuse. I know a bit about Civil War era guns, though I'm not an expert. One issue is the bullets you are firing are way too light. I just weighed a couple original Civil War Mine balls I have, and they were 30-32 grams. I've read online they were 34 grams (that's for the 1853 Enfield). The other is your gunpowder. Looks like you were using modern smokeless black powder which is far more powerful than the black powder used at the time of the Civil War. It's a harder to find the old style of black powder (I have a replica Enfield I've never fired because I haven't got my hands on the right powder yet). But Civil War reenactors use it all the time, so it's definitely out there. Infantry manuals gave precise instructions of how much powder to load in the paper cartridges, so that should get you pretty close to the load that you need. Perhaps the lead composition may be different, but I would definitely start by addressing those issues first.   Looking forward to part 2 to where you get the bullets to stick!",2년 전,50,

It would be extremely difficult to video a bullet self-destructing by combination of overheating and centrifugal force, but I bet you could figure out how to do it.

One thought though, those Miniballs were 50 caliber so a much larger mass than what you've been trying and were propelled by black powder which burns slower.  Rather than decreasing the amount of powder again since it appears you can get too little, try making larger bullets by making a ""plug end"" which fits further inside the cartridge so you don't end up going deeper into your gun barrel.",2년 전,0,

You might have more lead to fuse  after some of it fragments. Just a thought.  The muzzle loader calibers use were, Springfiled- .58 cal, Enfield- .577 cal, Lorenz- .58 cal. Breech loaders used were Spencer- .52 cal, Sharps .52 cal.  US rifle brand came in either .58 ca or .54 cal don't know if the were muzzle loaders or breech.

@urbangeeze1348,"Here's my take on this:- Firstly, I would have analysed the composition of the lead used in a civil war minie ball & replicated bullets to match. Then, not knowing the distance travelled by the original bullets in the museum, before striking each other, I would have reduced the amount of powder in both bullets on each attempt, to compensate for reduction of striking power thru distance travelled, without compromising safety. It would probably happen eventually, but I guess you would be looking at a long day of testing. I can see it's taken a lot of fabricating & planning for you to set this up, but I feel if you'd just gone that bit further as per my suggestion, you probably would have achieved what you set out to do.

@arsmol,Barrel should be really long for slowing effect. Don't forget there is expanding gas which accelerates bullet,2년 전,2,
@wienerwoods,"Or, try using less powder for a slower muzzle velocity. Higher velocity results in more fragmentation as the lead is unable to maintain it's structural integrity as the kinetic energy of each projectile is absorbed by it's opposite and re-directed perpendicular to it's original vector in the form of a pressure wave of heat. Lower velocity = less heat and pressure at impact, less heat and pressure at impact = lower terminal heat in each projectile. Less heat = more material cohesion = less fragmnetation.  Think of each bullet as an anvil from the perspective of the other bullet, and the powder charge as the hammer smashing it into the anvil:  If you want to shatter the bullet against the anvil, you'd pick the biggest sledge hammer in your toolbox with the longest handle and you'd that bullet it as hard as you could. Lead is extremely ductile at room tempeture. The melting point of lead is only 621 degrees F. when you hit the bullet with your giant steel sledgehammer against a giant steel anvil, most of the energy in the head of the hammer is going to be transferred into the anvil after passing through the bullet.   The ""lost"" energy will go into plastic deformation of the bullet in the form of heat caused by the impact of the hammer and the pressure wave this creates as it compresses first the bullet, then the anvil. If this heat is high enough, the bullet will fragment as the lead is stressed past the limits of Pb's elastic and then plastic deformation point (yield point) under loading. These limits are dictated by a combination of the material properties of the Pb bullet, It's mass and initial temperture, the amount of energy put into the system, the time over which this energy is delived, the direction from which it comes (vector) and the geometric shape of the bullet. If the loading (energy) comes axially and symmetrically, and heats up the bullet enough, it will first permenantly deform past it's elastic limit, then litterally dis-integrate past it's plastic limit due to thermal and mechanical stress as it transfers as much of the hammer's energy into the anvil as it's capable of transferring before structural failure.   In this case structual failure occurs through fragmentation / shattering. What if you want to deform the bullet without shattering it, you need to put less energy into the system. You need to load the material above it's yeild point to achieve ductile failure, but below it's plastic deformation limit.  Fortunately, there is a wide margin between plastic deformation and complete structural failure in ductile materials like lead. It's within this margin that those two civil war bullets fused instead of shattering. What's truly amazing is that they were fired on a battlefield at almost perfectly recipricol balistic trajectories, meeting at what appears to be the apex of both projectile's flight, with perfectly symmetrical / reciprocol azimuths and elevations.  Very spooky - but given the number of combatants (over 200,000) and the number of bullets flying (hundreds of millions) in a relatively small area ( 5 mile front defined by the Rappahaunic River) it's certainly not impossible. My guess is that the fused bullets came from oposing firing Minie balls hundreds of yards from one another more or less simultaneiously.   At the start of the battle the armies squared off a mile or so apart from each other over the river, and no doubt millions of bullets were fired at the start of the battle by each side as they closed with each other. The real question is where the fused bullet found exactly. That might give some clue as to the range at which they were fired, and thus the energy with which they met. If SED can replicate the fusion through energy management, they should be able make an educated forensic guess as to how far apart the guns that fired them were, and that might narrow down where the bullets came from.",2년 전,6,

@elementalist1984," @DEATH_TO_TYRANTS  wasn't sure if I'd missed that, but the type of lead would matter. I think the reason they were able to get the one that hit the aluminum wallet to fuse is because it kept the bullet in more or less one piece.",2년 전(수정됨),0,
@edufer111,"I think that if bullets collide inside a water balloon, they will slow down enough to stick to each other.",2년 전,1,
@wienerwoods," @elementalist1984  I suspect S.E.D's bullets partially fused because the aluminum wallet absorbed just enough energy from each projectile before catastrophic failure to allow them  to partially fuse.  Aluminum is a soft ductile metal. This is why it's used to manufacture the beer cans we love so much and other lesser but useful objects through forming, pressing and extruding manufacturing processes. Al has a much higher melting point (double) and electrical conductivity than Pb and is much less dense. The thermal (heat) conductivity of aluminum is where things get really interesting - it's almost an order of magnitude (10x) greater than that of lead.   Kinetic energy and heat are interchangeable object  properties - both are forms of the same thing:  Energy, which itself can best be understood as a differntial between two beer cans/bullets/wallets in terms of mass, space and velocity, with changes in these states governed by laws of thermodynamics - like the direction of energy always flowing from hot to cold, never being able to get as much energy out of a system as you put into it, due to entropy, and paradoxically, the law of conservation of energy, which states that energy can't be created or destroyed, only changed from one form to another.  I personally think the 2nd law of thermodynamics and entropy are bunk, but I can't PROVE it until the universe ends and starts all over again of it's own volition and invalidates our primitive understanding of natural phenomena and the supposed laws that govern them.  Anyway....  .... In my understanding of current Newtonian consensus reality, the aluminum wallet absorbed and dissapated the energy of the projectiles as it yeilded, deformed, and failed through impact. This process converted the motion of the bullets (kinetic energy) into heat through mechanical deformation of the aluminum, which also conducted and disapated some of this heat through radiant and convective cooling and the rest through it's own kinetic displacement (movement)  The titanium and steel wallets suffered the same transfers of kinetic energy and heated, yielded and deformed and kinetically displaced based on thier elemental properties surface areas, thicknesses and masses, but their limits of plastic deformation were not reached, so the bullets never pierced them, and so never met, much less fused. Instead they were fragmented and deflected / redirected as they dissapated thier residual kinetic energy.  I'm not an engineer or a scientist or anything though. I'm just a highschool dropout idiot savant polymath who pretends to be smart on YouTube now then, so I might be wrong about all that....  ;-)",2년 전(수정됨),0,

My bullet hit one of the wires and the wire snapped, the next day he went to fix the fence and kept the two ends where it broke to show me.

Your suggestion of the lead content being incorrect may be valid and changing that may yield better results, but the far simpler solution would be to introduce more drag on the bullets. This can be done by increasing the distance traveled at the cost of increased difficulty, or bullets with a different shape. As too little gunpowder will stop the bullet from exiting the barrel, introducing more resistance on the bullets could slow them to the desired speed.",2년 전,0,

@KaijuWRX,"Not an expert, however most bullets are designed to dump energy (expand) into the target they hit, unlike ball shot which was not really designed to do anything other than be fired out of a firearm... Sphere's also have some interesting physics and strength properties (no singular weak/strong point) to them that a more modern day bullet shape does not have. If you were to try this again but with 2 lead balls, I assume you would have a vastly different outcome with a much higher chance of fusion.

The 45-55 and 45-70 not long after the civil war were IIRC 16-1 to 20-1 lead/tin during their developing production and original rifles and carbines seem often to shoot better with out other metals that change the ductile nature of the bullet.

@SharpPointyThings,"Notes: The original bullets were heavy (about 460 grains), and nearly pure soft lead.  They'd likely slowed a lot before impact. It was probably almost like hammering them together. The chamber should always be cut to seat the bullet close to the leade. Freebore is undesirable and a source of inaccuracy and erosion. The short round looks shorter than .45 Schofield. Cartridges should be loaded to maximum volume for safety. Propellant and inert filler can be adjusted. This gives a consistent flame front, rather than a potential lateral ignition that can damage firearms (but wouldn't with the massive test barrels used) and affect pressure/velocity. I would keep the shields in place at all times except when zeroing or shooting.  Even if one side is empty, the shield is a good precaution against error. Awesome demonstration. The fragmentation patterns are fantastic.",2년 전,0,

@jml_53,"Destin, another great video. I had a couple ideas:  - could you 3d print a ice cream cone shaped insert for the cartridge.   Put the narrow end opening at the primer and the a wide end at the bullet. It would reduce the volume, allowing a more consistent charge.  - put a tarp down to make finding the bullets easier - mount a laser on each barrel.  It should help highlight some of the mystery drift in your aim from shot to shot if the connection to the barrel is rigid enough - would larger round help?  It would give you slower bullets and shift the momentum/ kinetic energy balance to a more favorable point with less KE at impact and less damage - the tilted debris plane reminds me of pool balls impacting.  I'd love to see someone do a finite element mode to understand and visualizel the propagation of the impact and deformation  Keep this great stuff coming. Wish i had the time to do stuff like this.

@craigsheffield6546,"As I first start to watch this, only one word comes to mind: CROSSFIRE!! Personally; throughout the first  half of the video, there was smokeless powder being used. This has much more power than black powder, which would have been used during the Civil War, and bullets at that time did fly much slower and, thus, could fuse. Smokeless powder is going to give off at least twice the power as black powder. Next is the copper jackets. Those will shatter right away, no matter what. Now, I could see them being used on and off, so, how often they were used is up for debate. If you try this again, don't use less smokeless powder to slow down the bullet, because that will only offset both packages. Use black powder and fill and entire cartridge.

@ThreeQuartersCrazed,"Yes, the lead is shattering because the bullets are moving too fast.  You can see the same thing with silly putty if you hit it with a hammer--it'll shatter.  This is the effect of the lead's viscosity and internal friction properties, like bulk modulus and shear modulus.  Any solid can only flow so fast as it deforms, because most materials are made of many tiny particles that hold themselves together through friction (unless it's a single solid crystal, in which case molecular forces hold it together).  If you try to deform it too fast, it falls apart because it can't flow fast enough.  Bullets in the Civil War obviously traveled much more slowly than modern bullets.  I'm also guessing that the lead was much less pure, which likely impacts the mechanical properties.  The impurities may have made it less viscous, but I'm not sure.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

I would try a custom molded bullet, using wheel weights or some thing similar, a soft lead alloy. I think the bullets are going way too fast. I would investigate a civil war era velocity and try to reproduce that. Along those lines as well, the barrels are too close to each other. There is probably a sweet spot of lead hardness, velocity and separation that will fuse the bullets more like the sample from the museum. Good luck !",2년 전,0,

@Reniconix,"I have 3 things to add, maybe you have already figured these out but I'll leave them here for all to read anyway!  1st, modern non-jacketed (all, but less important in jacketed) lead bullets are designed to withstand much faster spin velocities and are hardened with antimony to both prevent barrel fouling and keep the bullet from tearing itself apart. This makes them brittle and is the major component in the exploding seen in the video. Civil war lead was more ""pure"" lead.  2nd, the overall mass of the bullets. Modern .45 Colt bullets are about 1/4th the mass of a Minie ball. A more direct comparison, in every way, would actually be a 12 gauge shotgun slug (both approximately 1 to 1.5oz, Minie balls being available in .577 or .69 caliber and 12 gauge being .729).  3rd, as you addressed in this video, the bullets are going pretty fast. The Smithsonian example was likely not ""point blank"" like this, allowing the velocity to be much lower than you can achieve with this setup. You can probably simulate it with a shorter barrel, but safety is obviously the prime concern here.  Good luck with part two!",2년 전,0,

One thing you can possibly try to do is go back to the Museum and see if you can analyze the bullets themselvs both in weight, original shape and the metallurgy make up of them. If done carefully and with the right equipment it can be done without any damage to the artifacts.  All these could be factors that allowed them to Fuze together.

Then you would only have in mind to never walk into the deflecting area. And if for some reason you have to go into that area while life amunition is in the gun you can open up the shield. With that way of thinking you have one side of both guns completly free for your work until the test starts. No matter if it is a miss fire or not.  I would also have added an additional visual marker when the gun is loaded like a flag or a light. Just in case you load one and forget to make a mark in your notes.

@snafu2350,"'Today's lead' is considerably harder than the purer soft compound used back in C19, partially due to the increased velocities (thus stresses) modern propellant is capable of. Any jacketing may also be interfering with the desired weld - I am in no way an expert on any of these matters, but my gut feel is with what was stated during the vid: the lead needs to be softer & the velocity decreased.   Perhaps consider overboring the barrels used (with the same bullets) to simulate the lack of chamber pressure from period pieces? This would emulate the lower tolerances capable back then, & reduce the initial friction/loss of impetus from the bullet engaging the rifling grooves: for max efficiency (hence velocity) you want the bullet to fully engage ASAP, but these aren't 'skirted' bullets & therefore there would be some time period after primary charge ignition but before the bullet base expands enough to allow full rifle-groove engagement",2년 전,0,

@brazil3207,"If the creation of anything thru molecule to man evolution were true, nothing should evolve because organisms have ORGANS. and evolution could never get even 1 of them to function right, LET ALONE 4 OR 5!! AND THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM!!  The sequence of DNA can be identical but produce different results based on the presence or absence of epigenetic markers. So if humans and chimps share a common ancestor and these chemical tags are heritable, they should have similar epigenetic markers, right?  They should (if evolution were true), but they don’t.   the bbt (bigbang theory) is a manmade construct. How insane the chances must be for mill's of plants and animals to magically mutate over ludicrous spans of time. We should find missing links. However we dont, we only find Fully Formed animals. If animals could evolve into totally new animals, there should be a chance we find missing links. ONLY THE SIMPLEST LIFE FORMS SHOULD BE ABLE TO EVOLVE INTO EXISTENCE. GENETIC ENTROPY WILL UNDO WHATEVER BENEFITS THE ORGANISM MUTATED, FASTER THAN THE ORGANISM WILL MUTATE BENEFICAL TRAITS. EVEN THEN, THE CHANCES OF ANY ORGANISM MUTATING A BENEFICIAL TRAIT ARE NEXT TO NONE. HOW MUCH MORE CRAZY IS EVOLUTION, WHEN APPLIED TO MILLIONS OF PLANTS N ANIMALS?? FOR THEY ARE WITHOUT EXCUSE.... DEBUNKING BIGBANG:  if the bigbang was real the 2nd planet's orbit would be normal and sat turns ring particles should've moved too fast for ANY gravity to pull them towards the planet. And thats not even taking into account the bigbangs hot temprature which shoulda vaporized anything. also there is too little antimatter in universe. if bigbang was real 99.999999999999999999999% of our universe should Not exist because antimatter destroys matter when it make contact with matter. the bang wouldve made much of it touch matter. so we see far less stars n stuff bc the so called bigbang wouldve destroyed nearly all of it. . READ THIS VERY CAREFULLY!! ---->   this should prove that Jesus is Real: JESUS CHRIST will Not make you take any mark, and He will punish the tyrannical ANTI Christ. The ANTI Christ will get a terrible wound, but cure himself to reinforce his deception to decieve the non-Christians and the lukewarm Christians. (look up lukewarm Christians on Christian websites and/or the Bible.) the AC will be world famous and very popular. he will make people take a mark on r hand or forhead. there will be a severe punishment for not taking it. The ANTI-Christ is a control freak, the opposite of Jesus Christ. However, this AC will act all nice and cool for 3 years and 6 months, and then he will make a tyrannical dystopia. for another 3 years 6 months. Jesus uses His power for GOOD, NOT EVIL. This is BIBLE PROPHECY. Dont trust the false god, his goal is to get people into the lake of fire. he  will go there too, despite all the FALSE MIRACLES HE WILL DO!

@lukearts2954,"@smartereveryday you probably only read and consider suggestions from patreons, but on on the off chance you don't, here's my suggestion: since you were not using the exact minié (pronounced mini-A) balles, I guess you would be fine using different lead alloys too. Use solder, optionally with a tin jacket, and put a core of solder flux in them. Solder is a Tin-Lead alloy, to a ratio that fuses easily and consistently. There are different alloys for fusing at different temperatures. I would not go for the solder used in electronics, as they are made to melt at the lowest temperatures, and they might get too liquid to stay together. Or perhaps get an expert on lead alloys from the welding (brazing) industry, not the ammunitions industry, and ask them to tinker with the perfect alloy for your bullets.  I'm looking forward to see your other ideas as well. I can think of a couple. Actually, you could start easily by just putting solder flux on the outside of the bullets you already have (unjacketed ones), just to help that flow. Some fluxes (e.g. SK10, available in spray cans) lower the melting point of the alloy and burn off immediately so it's just a very brief and temporary lowering of the temperature. They don't make the strongest bonds, but it could help fusing pure lead.  TL;DR: try spraying solder flux SK10 on your lead bullets, or cast bullets from pipe solder with an S39 flux core ( and spray SK10 on them as well).",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@Jaster832,"It blows my mind that you had someone who actually does reloading as a hobby and he didn't say how bad of an idea it was to go with a shorter cartridge in a longer chamber creating bullet jump. Headspacing is a major key to tuning your hand loads to be accurate, every hunter who does their own custom loads knows this and tunes each of their hand loads to the specific rifle they're firing out of because you want to have a small and consisitent distance between the projectile in the chamber and the lans. Putting the same amount of powder in a smaller cartridge also affects pressure (increases it) which affects velocity. The ""problem"" you thought you had with the powder falling to the bottom of the case in a non-uniform manner isn't a problem because even your electronic primer should penetrate deep enough into the case to ignite the powder in a uniform manner.  To successfully fuse two projectiles in the manner you're hoping you'd need to have soft lead projectiles instead of the hardened and brittle standard projectiles that have a coating to make them safe to handle with your bare hands. You'd have to cast the projectiles yourself. You'd also likely want to have a smooth bore instead of rifling because putting a spin on the bullet isn't conducive to what you're trying to achieve, especially because each projectile will be spinning in opposite directions assuming you use the same barrel on both sides. You'd have to reverse the rifling on one of the barrels to make them match up and that's a lot tougher than just eliminating the riflign altogether (and the WoNA rounds probably didn't have rifled barrels.)",2년 전,0,

You could even have one air tank that would split the air between both projectiles to make syncing of the shots easier.

The bigger slugs could have the same kinetic energy but due to being bigger they would have more time to slow down gradually.,2년 전,0,

@grantmartin1852,"As other commenters have pointed out in one aspect or another, He'd have to try to duplicate bullet weight, speed, and composition of what was in use at the time. The fused bullets can get him on track as far as the caliber, bullet type, weight and composition.   From that, he can get much closer to the types of weapons that fired the bullets. But from a general perspective, at that point in time, for rifles, that would be in the 50 caliber region traveling at subsonic speeds, and most likely using pure lead. In fact, as pointed out elsewhere, the rotation of the bullets isn't helping either considering that they are rotating against themselves at impact. So that points to a smooth bore weapon.  The other thing to consider, which Dustin identified, is the lead type. Modern lead projectiles use trace elements like antimony to harden the lead. This makes it relatively more brittle than pure lead. Couple that with a much higher velocity, and a high angular momentum and we have the recipe for fragmentation.  What I believe is going on, is that the energy of impact, at much slower speed, and relatively 0 rotational velocity, allows the softer, pure lead bullets to ""weld"" themselves together.  Something else to consider: These two weapons most likely were fired at each other from a distance. And as such, their velocity began to decrease as soon as they left the muzzles. That means that at contact, their individual velocities would have been much, much lower than their initial muzzle velocities. This would aid in the welding process as the excess energy to dissipate through fragmentation would have been much less.  Another thing, I wouldn't get all wrapped up in the ""Odds of this happening"". Considering the millions of bullets that were fired in opposing directions, I'm pretty sure there are dozens or hundreds of these to be yet found. A search for ""images of civil war bullets that hit each other"" shows a large number have already been found.",2년 전,0,

@Pystro,"I think the bullets fused inside the ridge wallet because the first one had slowed down to below half of its initial velocity. To get the bullets slowed down that much without deforming them or risking them getting stuck inside the barrel, you might need to shoot them through several thin layers of some soft material. Applying only a small amount of force several times should impart much less of a tumble on the bullet than one single impact. And sheets of material that slow the bullet down via their mass, not their tensile strength, would make the applied force most repeatable. Something like wet paper might be ideal; more mass and less stability than even dry paper.  Also, the barrel takes away a fixed amount of energy. Where ""fixed"" means it doesn't depend on the speed of the bullet or the amount of powder, it's defined by the barrel length and whatever friction the individual bullet you are firing happens to have with the barrel. Especially if your powder contains only barely more energy than what the bullet looses to friction, any fluctuations in the amount of friction can have massive influence on the bullet energy, relatively speaking. Whereas an impact with an object of 1/10th the mass of the bullet always takes away 1/10th of the momentum. I.e. in absolute terms a faster bullet will get slowed down more than a slow bullet.",2년 전,0,

@twelvewingproductions7508,"Very fun. A couple things that I thought of. Seeing the fragmentation it was obvious even from the beginning that velocity was going to have to come waaaayyy down.  But the other thing that struck me was a kind of first principles examination of just what you were looking at in the museum. I don't think the ACTUAL caliber/mass/velocity of that specimen can be discounted. As I understand it, most of those musket balls were 68 caliber weren't they?  Additionally, their deadly nature was from their weight that would transfer a rather low speed projectile to the point where the bullet would remain inside the body. So I'm thinking you need to start this saga again but speak to someone who does civil war recreation firearm shooting. Get the data from them as far as the actual caliber and velocity of those original rounds. I think you will be surprised at how slow they actually flew.  450-500 fps would be my guess.

I'm sure you can still get the molds for mini balls and figure out the lead composition. The shape of the mini ball is very different from modern bullets as they have a hollow area at the rear and they were 50 or 55 caliber. Also, they were fired at distance with muzzle loaded rifles so their speed must have been much slower than what you were able to achieve. Maybe these factors are what is needed to fuse the bullets. Lastly, from what I understand, there are a few examples of bullets hitting each other in midflight at Vimy Ridge in France. The results were quite different though.",2년 전(수정됨),2,

@Danthe4thStreaming,"Two things which might affect the bullets sticking together. First, the rifling imparts a rotation to the lead slugs that adds to the forces affecting the fusion. Secondly, most significantly, air resistance against the nose of bullets causes the leading portion of the lead to MELT. This is why copper jackets were invented - they fly more accurately at longer distances because they don't deform.   Destin is firing at such short range that the lead doesn't heat up. Maybe try both smooth bore barrels, and a blob of solder at the tip of each bullet? Or perhaps some sort of heat source along the bullet's travel that will cause the face to melt. Something as simple as a couple propane torches - although the shrapnel might be a problem there.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@christophershort5480,"I think you were missing one detail that could help with the solidification of the two bullets, if you think about the battle of the Civil War,  there would be some kind of distance between two weapons (greater than the ones you were shooting from). If you also take a look at your videos, the bullets seem to shatter from almost point blank like glass from sheer force, it mushrooms out too fast and scatters, of course you said the bullets need to be slower, which should mushroom out and still be intact.  I propose to increase the distance between two weapons to let the bullets lose a little momentum and the initial blast the bullets is propelled by, the bullets will mushroom together and not shatter by the sheer force that just came out the barrels fired from the distance stands you got going on. Of course the  increased distance will make this replica experiment more dangerous and more variable, plus other factors that may come into play. You could cut the stands in half keeping the sheild deflectors so the makeshift firearms can be loaded safely still, then add a conex box down range in the middle and have both ends of the conex open to help contain the collision.

@justinsowa1972,"Two thoughts, 1. about the lead.  Modern lead is rarely lead only for bullets, it contains antimony and tin.  This makes them harder.  Often the bullets will be hardened.  You could try heating them before the bullet is seated.  This may remove the temper during the casting process.  The best would be to cast your own bullets with no tin and antimony.  2. The Civil War rifles were not firing with modern powders.  The black powder will ""burn"" quicker.  This change in the ""burn"" time will change the velocity and likely give a better result.  I think that the ammo was of various calibers, what if the size of the bullet was larger, like .58 caliber.  My thoughts.  Great video and, as always, very interesting.",2년 전,0,

@DarkLordReborn,"Fun fact... bullets from the Civil War era had aluminum in them. Less than 5%, I believe, but still had some in it. The bullets today are far more refined and cheaply made. They look for aerodynamics and impact damage more than composition of the bullets. Manufacturers use the cheapest metals or alloys they can to get the closest results of what they aim for. This makes fusion of the bullets all but impossible.  Using proper era made bullets would yield far closer result to what you are striving for.",2년 전,0,

@michaelwang6809,"Materials science of ballistics: The reason the bullets are shattering is because they are hitting with too much energy, Newton's 3rd law (equal and opposite reaction) and the bullets hardness is essentially equal. The bullets are hitting with so much kinetic energy (KE=(1/2)*m*v^2), on such a direct trajectory (not able to deflect off each other and keep going); that energy has to go somewhere, so it goes into the creation of new surface area, energy gets absorbed into the unzipping of the material grain boundaries (intergranular fracture, likely) or intragranular fracture (less likely) which results in shattering the bullets. With lower energy, the metal would still heat up, locally melt, and have a tendency to plastically deform instead of shatter, which is what you saw when the two merged after hitting the aluminum ridge wallet. In the case of shooting the aluminum ridge wallet, the aluminum hardness is much less than the bullet hardness, so the aluminum preferentially fails first; allowing that first bullet to slow down to the point that when it collides with the other bullet, there is less energy available to go into the creation of new surface area (i.e. shattering the bullet). In the case of the Damascus steel/titanium ridge wallet, the bullet's are less hard, so they preferentially erode first and shatter (there is a very tiny ""bullet dwell phenomena"" time, where the bullet literally sits on the surface of the metal plate, is eroding and cannot penetrate, this can be seen utilizing flash radiography, or see figure 9 in the monograph entitled Developing an Ultra-lightweight Armor Concept, by Charles E. Anderson, Jr. in Wiley's Progress in Ceramic Armor volume 1 by the American Ceramic Society, ACerS); this is essentially how modern body armor works by using high hardness steel or ceramic armor plate. So two conditions for you to explore; how do I have enough energy to leave the barrel of the gun, but at the point of impact, have lost enough energy such that the bullet material plastically deforms instead of completely shattering.   NOTE: One practical consideration for your experiment which you could do, besides decreasing the powder content, which might help you achieve your goal is to increase the distance between the guns. This would decrease the energy of the rounds when they meet since they are no longer at what is essentially muzzle velocity in your experiment. On a civil war battlefield, the soldiers firing at each other would likely have been at a much farther distance away from each other than your two-gun setup. One caveat though, depending on how far apart you place your guns, you may have to adjust for bullet arc (rise/fall of the projectile along it's ballistic trajectory), which is even more crazy to think that in the past, two guys shooting at each other, lined up at such a perfect distance and trajectory that when their bullets collided, enough energy of the round has been sapped away that they merged instead of shattering. Another variable is that modern gunpowder is likely different from civil war era gun powder, the burn rates, and thus energy propelling the projectile is a variable; slower burning powder down the X-length barrel takes longer to build up pressure; so depending on which powder you used to reload your ammunition, you may be able to change the burn rate by changing the powder used. Your comment about projectile metallurgy is also valid, as likely the metallurgical control back then was not as good as it is today; but what really matters is the material properties which I mentioned (hardness, which is mainly a function of local composition and microstructural grain size [itself a function of work hardening, heat treatment, temper])",2년 전,1,

@jonnas1977,"i am in no way a scientist or firearms expert. but, based on my limited knowledge of firearms and ammunition, i think the use of the type of ammunition is where one of your issues could be arising from. i had to research the Minié ball to discover that it was a iron core with a lead jacket. where as the rounds you appear to be using are a frangible round and of course the full metal jacket rounds. a possible fix might be to find a modern day round that has a similar composition to the Minié ball. my theory is that the fused impact was based more on a softer metal making the initial impact and the harder core keep fusion stable, as an example, it's like two wooden dowels with glue on the end coming together. where as the frangible rounds are designed to shatter on impact to prevent pass through solid objects and the full metal jacket rounds are a hard metal shell with a lead core which causes the metal to strike a hardened surface first. again, i must state this very clearly, this is based on limited firearms knowledge. i also hope my ramblings are making sense.",2년 전,0,

Because they're pointing in opposite directions, the rifling for each barrel spins the bullet in opposite directions. I don't know how much of an effect it would have on the ultimate results, but I think it'd be interesting to see what happens when the bullets are only clashing in terms of linear momentum while being matched (as closely as one can reasonably get, at least) in terms of angular moment.

@Tokushu101,"There's 4 bullets (2 each) somewhere in this world in a museum (that I know of). Think one set was from the civil war and one from the WW1.  The biggest issue today is the lead we make them out of.  The one from the civil war, fused.. as Did the one from the WW1, If I remember right, which had copper jackets. The fact this even happens on a battlefield is amazing in it's time. Nowadays the chances of this happening are far less, which would make it even more of a feat to behold. Watching your shatter was worth the watch though and the wallets are pretty tough..   Ps. I like the wallets, just dislike the metal frames.  My dickies wallet is gold though as it comes with a built in security feature to keep people from reading your card when it has a micro ship in the card. Made of premium leathers and as small as yours, also comes with a foldable money clip. Built in!

@SaltiRogue,"​ @smartereveryday  That's because the projectile of the Minié ball was mostly comprised of an iron plug and the lead was used along with some grease to promote pressure buildup/obturation.   So, my guess would be that the Civil War era Minié ball fuses because the iron plug construction and modern ammunition is mostly lead &/or copper. As for the lack of lead or iron oxide, my guess is that the bullet is regularly cleaned because it's a Smithsonian museum. I do have to note that I am not an engineer and I can only cite Wikipedia's Minié ball article in my research for this comment :)",2년 전,33,
@Tyler1169,"i think this test also left out a few key variables. 45 long colt and minie ball have similar muzzle velocities, but the bullet weights are way different. minie ball usually weight 510 grains. also the powder charges are different, black powder for the civil war and smokeless in the 45 long colt. also the distance at which the test was performed isn't the same as the conditions that the bullets may have collided. average engagement distances were around 60 yards in the civil war also this collision could have happened at at greater engagement distance which would also have and effect on the overall velocity of the projectile at point of impact. not complaining about the absolute mountain of work that went into the gem of free media but i think it's hard to dismiss it fully until all variables are tested. also the smithsonian could also be regularly cleaning the bullets as well to keep them in display condition.",2년 전,33,
@spacehitchhiker4264," @Solidst8dad2112  If you google ""antimony in lead bullets"" The gist is that plain lead is gummy and leaves fouling in the barrel. Antimony stops that, and makes the bullet harder but more brittle.",2년 전,25,
@snowstalker36,"​ @smartereveryday  You did fuse copper, or at least a copper lead alloy. Which brings up thought #1, the fused Minie balls may be an alloy. The melding in the aluminum wallet makes me lean even more towards this. Maybe from due to impurities in the metal from lower concern over purity at mining and different ore origins, or manufacturing contamination (lower ammo quality is a constant in wartime), or maybe something added from the powder burn or wadding? It looked like you were using much cleaner Smokeless powder as opposed to the dirtier Black powder that would have been used then and definitely no wadding. The cone of the Minie ball could trap some of the debris from firing?  Thought #2, the example bullets are rifle bullets with about twice the mass of material compared to .45 Long Colt. This could let them shed more material in the impact while it slows down enough to fuse?",2년 전,11,
@RichardCranium321,"so if it was not legit/ faked, then how would it be done?  it looks like the two were moving at significantly different velocities, and it looks like they did impact each other, but the permanent fusing is definitely suspicious.

@keithyinger3326,"​ @Solidst8dad2112  that's what I'm wondering about as well. Those old mini balls looked like they might have been just a softer alloy perhaps. The new ones they were firing really fragmented apart when they hit each other. I'm sure he can't test those ones in the museum but perhaps if he got his hands on some other Civil War era lead, he could have an xrf done to determine exactly what the impurities are in that old lead.

But it could also just be that the one bullet formed a skirt around the other one, with a friction fit. That's what it looks like in the footage.

@Demo12345,"Something to note, the munitions you're using are using modern day smokeless powder. Smokeless powder is a different beast to black powder. Smokeless powder has higher pressures and velocities compared to black powder, that higher velocity is quite possibly why your bullets are smashing instead of deforming.   So I suggest you try using black powder instead of smokeless powder, also you might want to go to a .50 caliber round instead, a larger bullet should have more lead in it and as-such should have a better chance of holding together. And you should try casting your rounds like you first thought, my guess is that, like you said, the lead mixture used in modern bullets is a harder alloy than what you would have had during the civil war meaning that instead of deforming on impact, it holds it's shape.  If you want to have an excellent demonstration of how the rounds would mainly crush and deform as they hit their target, I suggest watching Garand Thumb's video where he tries out a flintlock rifle and shows it impacting a target. Another possible source of info is Brandon Herrera's video where he recreated president Lincoln's assassination and also shows the round hitting the target.",2년 전,0,

@dfdempire8912,"@smartereveryday   The Original bullets were Rifle rounds and would have been at a very high velocity when fired, but there would have been a lot more distance between the bullets ton slow them down before impact.  what i suggest is to use a medium load of powder and measure against the static target the range and the force enacted to where a single bullet doesn't explode. then double the distance as you'll then have 2 bullets so twice the force and you should be able to fuse the bullets as they are fast enough  to leave the barrel but have enough distance to slow down mid flight.  The shortened version is that your experiment is too small and you need to add space between the guns to lower velocity.  i hope you see this and can use it to get the desired result :)   Like so he can see it",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@heirofaniu,So if you're going to do this again in the future a few things to note that'll (hopefully) make fusing them easier:  >The minee balls of the civil war rifles were sixty-eight caliber and weighed about three times the amount that a 45LC does while also being longer nose to tail >The lead in use back then was much more pure and much softer than modern lead used in smokeless powder applications >The lead bullets used back then had no jacketing >The rifles back then fired projectiles at much lower velocities than even a relatively slow cartridge like 45LC does using modern smokeless powder loadings  All four of these things taken as a group would (theoretically) allow for a much easier fusing of two rounds with this setup.,2년 전,0,
@raisagorbachov,My dad used low charges in his reloads because he didn't see the point of wasting a lot of powder on making a loud noise when the target was only a couple of hundred yards away.

The wad used could have been waxed or wax could have been in the lead itself. One earlier comment mentioned the rifling and spin of the bullet. To counter the twist, you could have a lh twisted barrel and a rh twist. Or try smooth bores. Trying to make two knuckle balls meet in the middle will just add to the fun! 😂  Now, the thing I hate to bring up... those bullets at the museum likely fused at a rate of speed too slow to exit the barrels at such close range. They likely impacted mid battlefield at a very slow speed. That, my friend, will require a much longer I-beam! But, two bullets can be collided using non gun propulsion to find the ""fusion speed"".

@69sound81,"okay, here is my input into this because I think it is an amazing experiment. try slightly longer barrels, a slightly more direct hit instead of a light offset if you haven't, a consistent barrier on the exit of each bullet like pieces of cardboard to slow them down, and you can actually even make them go through a second barrel to guide them. I saw a very interesting video a long time ago where a guy called matt with a huge channel called demolition ranch used cooper piping to force a 45 acp follow a crazy twisted route (and it worked). It even worked with a bent barrel and a 556 bullet to make a full turn and hit the scope of the same rifle it was fired from. So, piping perfectly alligned as secondary barrels might help to increase the probability of direct impact and soft barriers might help with the speed of the bullets.  you might also consider changing bullets. 12 gauge slugs of pure lead are a big mass to accelerate and they decelerate quite faster... specially when they hit a barrier. but dont use water because lead will fuse better if it is hot and soft.",2년 전,0,

@therealbeaker,"As a handloader, I loved this video more than you can imagine!  Using Remington E-tronx primers to solve the variable of lock time is exactly what I thought would work, haven't seen those in a long time! When you were talking about the amount of powder in the case, and how the 45LC case length left airspace in the cartridge under the bullet, I immediately said to the screen ""why don't they use IMR Trailboss powder.  It's meant for exactly this.  Mimics black powder charge volumes and is usually on the slower side"".  Cue to the part where you show the handloading and he's using exactly that!  Trailboss!  Impossible to miss with it's unique donut shaped flakes.  My only idea for this test would be to use cast bullets in the 250-300gr range (takes up more case volume, usually slower velocity as well) and cast them from dead soft pure lead like they used for minie balls in the civil war.  The bullets you're using, if they're commercial, I think are too hard for the fusion you want. Antimony in harder lead makes it fracture like that.  Aim for something in the Brinell hardness range of 5-7.  Let them air cool, don't cast and quench in water. Commercial bullets are usually 18-26 BHN.  Also, aim for 750-850fps. Can't wait to see the update!!  If you need someone to cast you some bullets for the test, lemme know!!!!  Fascinating stuff.  Keep up the good work!",2년 전,0,

@tomctutor,"@32:00 Ok guys here's the maths:  Two bullets each 0.014Kg with a velocity (I assume) of speed of sound (=340 m/s) collide, this gives a combined kinetic energy of 2X 1/2mv^2 = 1600Joule. So how much energy is that? Well to lift a person above your head height (~80kg) up 2 metre ~ 1600Joule (Potential energy = mgh) In theory then the energy of the collision is equivalent to a wrestler throwing his opponent over his head! In terms of heat generated in lead bullets at moment of collision, E= mC△T (Specific heat),  1600 = 2X 14X  0.130X △T solving gives a △T =  440 degC, adding ambient outdoor temp of 25 degC gives final temp = 465 degC. Now lead melts at 330 degC so lead would melt and should have fused! But aluminium (wallet casing) melts at much higher temp (660 degC) so that's why lead bullets did not fuse.

@billtisch3698,"Just because I had nothing to do this one time, I calculated the approximate odds of this happening in a real battle in the Civil War.  I estimated the number of opposing bullets fired in a typical battle, and the number of possible places over that same battlefield where two opposing bullets might have come into contact.  The space between two armies is huge compared to the amount of space taken up by bullets.  The odds of two bullets colliding were one in an indescribably enormous number.  So enormous that I had to conclude that it was, in fact impossible.  I believe with all my being that the artifact on display in that museum was actually constructed fraudulently to make a few bucks selling it to an eager curator.  I mean, how can there be any provenance for such a thing?  A guy in a field says, ""Hey, look what I found!""  Really?   Mathematically, I just can't believe it.",2년 전,0,

@ppipanman,"The velocity is too high for the bullets to fuse. Firing points distance and barrel length contribute to the high minimum speed for your test. Look at the velocity drop off over distance graphs for some standard ammunition. If you were 200 yds away (100 for each barrel) the bullets would each lose approx. 25% of their velocity only getting slower as distance increases. That would, however, make that impact point exponentially harder to hit. Another possibility could be to shorten the barrel to allow lower charges without getting squibbed.

@FMitchellFelling,"I think there are four contributing factors.  First, as you have determined, is controlling the energy.   Second, you need either pure lead or 30:1 lead:tin alloy.  I am sure any number of guys could cast some bullets for you.  Third, I think the minié bullet design might have a contributing effect as well.  The hollow base and thin skirt may act as a crumple zone to absorb some energy in a way the helps preserve retained weight.  Fourth, you may find that a higher initial bullet weight is needed.  The .58 caliber minié of the civil war was around 500 grains, giving a combined total of 1,000 grains for two.  You appear to have been using a Lee 230 grain tumble lube bullet.  The final retained weight of the joined bullets will be a function of the initial weight.   I would suggest a 400 grain pure lead bullet using a starting load of Accurate 5744 for a velocity of around 600 fps from your test rig.",2년 전,0,

@gaussmanv2,"Hey Destin, a fun aside for discussing how impact angle changes the resulting direction of expelled material. If you have two laminar streams of water pointed directly at each other, the resulting spray will come out in a 180° pattern. If you start to change the angle of attack the spray will decrease from 180 and decrease until the streams are parallel. If you point two streams at each other that are in a transitional state somewhere between laminar and turbulent, you can create a repeating signal that creates a fan that waves. It's similar to how windshield nozzles work. They're actually one line being rastered. You can see this if you take light up the stream with a strobe light. If you can change the frequency of the strobe, you can find the frequency of the fluidic.",2년 전,0,

@D_Boone,"@SmarterEveryDay A few notes for you to consider. I agree with changing the bullet composition. Modern all lead bullets are made of 'hard cast lead' which is a lead alloy mixed with silver, tin, and antimony. This raises the Brinell hardness from about 4 to 15-30 depending on composition. This improves penetration characteristics because it deforms less, but also makes it much more brittle and more likely to fragment than deform. Switching to pure lead with the lower velocities might do the trick.  Second, Civil War Minie balls were usually around 500 grains and .54-.58 caliber, meaning it is nearly twice the mass of an average 255 grain .45 LC and has a significantly larger diameter. Not sure if this will effect the test, but I certainly could see it happening.  Third, I am highly doubtful this would have an effect, but because of the distribution of rifles in the South during the Civil War, it is likely that only one bullet would have been spinning, and possible neither of them would have been. Although they are twisting so little during the impact, I doubt it has any significant impact.",2년 전,0,

I also reload and you have an error in your thinking-  more powder does not equal more pressure or speed, less powder does not equal less pressure or speed.  Packed load (a load with no airspace) burns at a different rate than a load with airspace which equals different pressure and speed.  The best thing you can do is try a range of loads, say from 1.5 grn to 2.5 grn or whatever.  Increase each load by 0.1grn and then chronograph this.  You'll see points in the speed data that will level off around certain loads.  then choose a load in that range so if the powder burns slightly inconsistent or there is a variance in the powder grains the pressure and velocity will not vary much and you'll get more consistent shots.",2년 전,0,

@igormikuska4369,"Why did you go with longer cartridges instead of shortening the barrel? Figuring out how to capture it was probably time consuming as well; would love to see the technicals behind that as well. Did you scavenge for scraps after each shot with metal detectors, so you do not mix up results? There is probably a way to design a fiducial such that you can see your writing from multiple angles, so that you can shoot from multiple angles. Multiple transparent planes, all 90° from the stablizing plane, crossing through each other at a single point, with half the writing on each side of the cross for each plane and with different coloured text on each plane. In editing you can fluff up/down colours for each angle. The colours even makes it easier with coding names for cameras and their shots. The downside is the same as in the video - the fiducial can not be the direct background to the bullets (the bullets can not be superimposed onto the fiducial), it has to be lower/higher than the bullets' paths. Another way to go about it is on the sides (two parts on each plane, except for the gounding plane/with empty space in the middle/with no plain crossing point), but you lose the measuring function the closer you get to the centre. That way you can not take the video shots 90° from the bulluets' paths, the quality of shots and number of planes would be reverse proportional, how close the video shot would be to 90° of the bullet's parths and the wideness of the plane gap would be reverse proportional (for a good quality shot), and if you want to capture the bullets through their full path (no superimposition of fiducials over a bullet), the gap would have to be big enough to fit both barrels' ends. It would also be difficult to reuse such a fiducial as such material would not sustain as much damage. Another way to go about it is to have a ring around the whole scene (behind the guns, behing the cameras) with repeated writing. To fix the measuring inconsistencies from the curviture you would need 3d magic on whatever is printed on the ring. Does trying this in vacum sound even more exciting or the same?",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@TheMaricarrr,That gap between the bullet and the rifling is called headspace. An experienced handloader/reloader will make specific bullets just for their firearm by measuring the headspace. (as each firearms headspace is unique) The tighter the tolerence in headspace not only makes the load more accurate but increases pressure. Measuring headspace when making bullets for specific firearms has always been an important step for making an accurate load. I really appreciate that you were able to confirm this technique in high speed. The old timers that taught me how to reload/handload expressed the importance of this step. You confirmed it Dustin!

Or about twice as much lead as the bullets Destin was using.  More lead, without opposing rotations, might be enough to make them fuse, especially if it was also a slower collision than Destin's (and given how quickly smoothbore balls lose velocity compared to spin stabilized bullets it might well be a slower collision than even low powder close-range firing can provide).",2년 전,21,

@Schultz-ko3ve,"The biggest difference between the historical bullet and yours, and why your results were different probably has a lot to do with the set up. Originally you had two shooters who had enough powder to send their bullets from the barrel at a certain velocity. Those bullets then had more distance in which to slow enough that when they hit, much of the energy had dissipated allowing them to slow  enough that they fused rather than disintegrate each other. Your experiment had the bullets coming from the barrels and striking each other while they still had a lot of energy in their velocities. Great job and what an exciting video!",2년 전,0,

@Cartermchick," @rppope1006  basically, it’s a matter of the forces acting on the bullets, and the original states of the bullets. While one bullet is traveling faster horizontally (along the x axis for the sake of explanation) neither bullet is starting with any speed on the y axis; neither starts with any speed vertically. This means that from a physics standpoint, if we want to see when the bullets will hit the ground, nothing happening in the x axis matters whatsoever, because it works independently from the y axis. That’s the basics, but taking it further, both bullets have one force acting on them in the y-axis, gravity. Acceleration (change in speed) of gravity on an object is constant (it doesn’t depend on the mass of the object, weird right?) so, that means that the bullets’ speeds in the y axis are changing at the same rate , so if they’re dropped from the same height, neither initially going up or down, they’ll experience the same acceleration for the same amount of time, and hit the ground at the same time, entirely regardless of how fast either is moving along the x-axis. Hope that helps- sorry for the long explanation",2년 전,1,

@Irishrave,i have to ask but the bullets you show at the top of your video do indeed look fused but i see no rifling and i noticed that every single shot you made had rifling and since those bullets spun in opposite directions upon impact no matter how little powder you use you wont be able to replicate the shock welding of those two without outside help such as those that hit the wallet. reversing the rifling on one side or using smooth barrels would keep those bullets from sprawling such as they have been still a really cool video on the dynamics of mid air collision and splatter. Being Caused by leads ability to break up upon impact which makes them so affective as a projectile. Additionally I wonder if you could weld 2 steel bullets together not changing that set up since you can reuse that mechanism for further experimentation.,2년 전,0,

@prjndigo,"I'll mention something that will blow your mind:  barley flour.   There were a LOT of loading specifications that included barley flour in the powder charge.  So what you're looking at in the museum is a completely different kind of bullet.  Poured in a casting block from the nose first of all, the velocity was probably around 830-930f/s because they were under-powdering the shots due to moisture causing a slower but more expansive burn.    You CAN some shots get pellets to fuse together from a pellet rifle by sticking one in the muzzle and the other fired normally (both aimed out) and you get a nice sharp clap of breaking the sound barrier from the compaction.   I suspect the thing that made the two bullets in the museum stick was that clap, so we're talking about an incredibly accurate strike and probably both had a little dimple from where the pour happened and the sprue from the fill-hole was broken off.",2년 전(수정됨),1,
@Sevness,"This is the single safest, most controlled, most carefully made video I have ever seen when it comes to dealing with fire arms. The fact it took years to make, is honestly the best thing, because i know a lot of people would just rush to the chase, hook up 2 guns of same make and model, toss them in some vice grips, hide behind some old tires or other stuff, and use a string or simple mechanical device to shoot the guns at the same time.  Which is why you can tell this was done for the sake of science and personal curiosity, over actually trying to gain fame; this took YEARS to do, and the first 1/3rd of the video is literally going over every safety measure taken, and even bringing experts in to further idiot proof it. It brought me back to the days of Myth Busters, but even that was rushed to get a result often due to needing to be on TV in a reasonable time.",2년 전,0,

@MorrisPlagens,This was great but you should try to shoot them through Ballistic gel.  Not length wise but through the side.  It could be the trick to slowing them down enough.  The gel will cause the bullets to deflect slightly but going through the sides could give you less deflection and the chance to fuse them together.  The other problem you are having is the mass of the bullets.  I believe most civil war rifles were 58 to 69 caliber and 4-500 grain bullets.  The typical rifle probably shot in the area of 750-1000 fps.  Absolutely great video and love your channel.,2년 전,0,

@BigFatDynamo82,I wonder if the burn temperature of black powder vs the kind of smokeless powder you used will help to create a softer lead projectile as it flies downrange.    The extra mass of the wallet seemed to prevent the bullets from being able to shear off in other directions.  The energy of the hit was less able to disperse therefore and more of it must have been converted to heat energy for the welding of lead to lead.    I'm also wondering if you added a significant amount of mass to your lead projectiles if they would be more apt to fuse.

Our prototype can react to bullets just leaving a gun barrel less than a meter in distance and destroy it within nanoseconds (speed of light vs. speed of projectile) The challenges we're facing is the line of sight needed for early destruction of the projectile which would require multiple placement of the laser source/reflection mirror relative to the protecting target.

@mr.mcewan9261,"The key to lack of fusion may very well be the twist rate of the guns that fired the bullets. I do not know the twist of the barrels in your test barrels. Recommended rates for 45 Colt barrels is one turn in 20 inches. Civil war muskets ranged from smoothbore guns with no rifling, to rifled musket twists varying from 1 turn in 78"" to one turn in 48"". A very common rate was 1 turn in 72 inches. In my opinion, if the spinning bullets are in opposing directions in your design, creating a shearing effect,  that would preclude any possibility of fusion. I would suspect that using a non threaded barrel in your gun might work. Or using barrels with the same direction of twist at the contact point might also work.",2년 전,0,

@AndyDoodle,One thing that might help is the shape of the mini ball did have a hollow area in the rear of the projectile. The design was for this to expand slightly in the barrel giving a better grip on the rifling. Not exactly sure how much that will make a difference on impact but could allow the lead to deform slightly rearward saving the projectiles from fully pancaking. They were also much larger than the rounds used in your video. I'm not a historian but 500 grains is what I have seen online (Historynet) for a .58 caliber projectile.,2년 전,0,

@moodberry,"I'm just a layperson, but I think I know what the problem is. In order to fuse lead (or any metal for that matter), the temperature of the lead has to be identical and at the melting point of lead when it fuses. Otherwise, fragmentation will occur. And as we saw, that was what you were getting - fragments, not fusing. SO in the Civil War, the lead was traveling slower (as you acknowledged) because the velocity of bullets then were slower than they are now. However, it is the MASS of the bullets you are using now that is different. Civil War bullets had more mass. How is that important? It's important because the amount of TIME in which the Civil War bullets had to ""melt"" was long enough for the generated heat of impact to travel through the entire mass, allowing the whole bullet to melt and fuse. With your modern bullets, the mass is smaller and the time of impact is less, not allowing your bullets enough time to melt and fuse.",2년 전,0,

You can also add a small amount of sawdust to slow it down a little, effectively reducing the quality of the powder. Consider using a wad to pad the case and keep the powder in contact with the bottom of the case too.  Pure lead will help with the fusion.

Try preheating the bullets, in war time the barrel of the gun would be hot, so it is possible that lead bullets are soft enough for the fusion.

@wvXvxvXvw,"TLDR: You would have a better chance of fusion if you used smooth bore barrels, a larger caliber projectile and black powder instead of smokeless.   To get the fusion, you need to change a couple of things on the rig. First, you need a bigger bore. Something in the 54+ cal range. Second, not all guns used in the Civil War were rifled. They also used smooth bore weapons. With a rifled barrel you get spin, which adds momentum away from the center of the projectile. The faster you spin something, the less stable(structurally) it is. An example is if you run a 6.5 Creedmoor out of a 1:7 twist barrel at 3200fps, the projectile would explode right after it leaves the muzzle. It is essentially pulling itself apart. Add to that the fact that you have two bullets rotating in different directions, you increase that outward momentum times 4. Lastly, they used black powder. It's much faster burning than smokeless powder and develops much less velocity with a much higher case fill(meaning you can take up more of that empty space in the brass). It takes 150 grains of black powder to produce the same velocity that 50 grains of smokeless powder can do to the same projectile.",2년 전,0,

I would honestly suggest taking a page out of 'how to make everything's book and try to figure out how they made the lead back then and try to recreate it. Its likely that at the high speeds the lead is too brittle to deform and fuse together and instead crack and shatter like you saw, expending all the energy that would have led to them fusing in the blasted away shrapnel.

I looked up the Springfield 1861 rifled musket (most common civil war small arm), and it has a 1:72 twist rate with a 1000fps muzzle velocity. That is a much slower twist than most modern guns. The bullet was also undersized, which would have reduced the efficiency of the rifling.  The minie ball projectile also commonly had a hollow base. The most common balls had a cone shaped divot in the base that expanded when fired to better engage the rifling.

@vaakdemandante8772,"The bullets fly way to fast i.e. have way too much energy to fuse. Either the distance had to be longer or the amount of power had to be lower. Historical accuracy would imply the distance should be higher - not to mention most of this could be calculated beforehand, to at least get a sane estimate of the required setup, instead of that much trial-and-error. I guess it's the old age conflict between more scientific vs more engineering approach. Engineering is certainly the more ""showy"" one, so I understand the choice.  The metal composition observation is spot on - sure looks like the lead isn't sticky / gummy / melted enough to fuse - I would bet the war time lead had less heat conductivity so that it stayed hot longer and hence fused better. The lead in the video cools way too rapidly for it to fuse - maybe it's too pure? Don't know, I am not a metallurgist but he issue is interesting.   I've also noticed the default state of the bullet-plates is open, while it should be closed - defaults matter, a lot. Like in 26:26, you can see Destin loading one barrel, while the other one is open. Yes, most probably there's no bullet in the other one, yet. And the positive cable is disengaged BUT most of the serious mishaps happen when bad things lineup just right.  There could be a bullet in the 2nd one, because of some unexpected break in the firing sequence and a ""happy"" spark from a falling rock or something just happens to ignite the gun. Improbable? Sure, but it's the improbable things that kill most unexpectedly. Sane defaults are just another layer of safety and they are cheap - in this case basically free, use it.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@Texas_Roclimber,"💯💯💯 OF COURSE IT COUNTS!!! ❤🥸🤪 The aluminum wallet slowed down the bullet allowing it to fuse. By YOUR OWN ADMISSION, the bullets are going to fast to fuse. The civil war bullets were NOT fired at point blank range. We’ll NEVER know how far apart they were fired from. But from a RESULTS PERSPECTIVE, it is obvious the bullets had slowed enough to be in the sweet zone of enough energy to fuse but not too much energy to explode. As with every bullet, muzzle velocity is always the fastest the bullet will ever go.  And the further you are down range from the bullet, the velocity exponentially slows down.  Aluminum wallet VS gravity and atmospheric conditions, both are external forces causing the bullets to slow down enough to not transfer enough energy to cause an explosion, but still enough energy to not cause the bullets to just bounce off each other.  There is a sweet spot of energy delivered at the point of impact that allows for fusion vs failed experiment.  From a kinetic energy, drag coefficient, velocity, mass and sectional density perspective, you have attempted to created an experiment that, as you pointed out is so complex, you’ll probably NEVER figure out ALL the variables. And I KNOW that will drive you absolutely BONKERS!!  HOWEVER, accidentally you did discover a KEY factor in replicating the desired result. Figuring out a way to reduce velocity at point of impact.  Of course that equation is also something so full of variables it will probably drive you BONKERS.  Here is an excellent read on this portion of the experiment.   The external ballistics of a bullet's path can be determined by several formulae, the simplest of which is: Kinetic Energy (KE) = 1/2 MV2 Velocity (V) is usually given in feet per second (fps) and mass (M) is given in pounds, derived from the weight (W) of the bullet in grains, divided by 7000 grains per pound times the acceleration of gravity (32 ft/sec) so that: Kinetic Energy (KE) = W(V)2 / (450,435) ft/lb This is the bullet's energy as it leaves the muzzle, but the ballistic coefficient (BC) will determine the amount of KE delivered to the target as air resistance is encountered. Forward motion of the bullet is also affected by drag (D), which is calculated as: Drag (D) = f(v/a)k&pd2v2 f(v/a) is a coefficient related to the ratio of the velocity of the bullet to the velocity of sound in the medium through which it travels. k is a constant for the shape of the bullet and & is a constant for yaw (deviation from linear flight). p is the density of the medium (tissue density is >800 times that of air), d is the diameter (caliber) of the bullet, and v the velocity. Thus, greater velocity, greater caliber, or denser tissue gives more drag. The degree to which a bullet is slowed by drag is called retardation (r) given by the formula: r = D / M Drag is difficult to measure, so the Ballistic Coefficient (BC) is often used: BC = SD / I SD is the sectional density of the bullet, and I is a form factor for the bullet shape. Sectional density is calculated from the bullet mass (M) divided by the square of its diameter. The form factor value I decreases with increasing pointedness of the bullet (a sphere would have the highest I value). Since drag (D) is a function of velocity, it can be seen that for a bullet of a given mass (M), the greater the velocity, the greater the retardation. Drag is also influenced by bullet spin. The faster the spin, the less likely a bullet will ""yaw"" or turn sideways and tumble in its flight path through the air. Thus, increasing the twist of the rifling from 1 in 7 will impart greater spin than the typical 1 in 12 spiral (one turn in 12 inches of barrel). webpath. med. utah. edu/  TUTORIAL/ GUNS/ GUNBLST  Additionally, civil war bullets were ball ammo typically around .58 caliber. Not a round nose .45. I’d imagine ball ammo is going to impact differently than round nose ammo.  Some ideas I’ve thought about on this topic. Use the AIR GUN principle to replicate this experiment.

I suspect that the fragmentation is much more likely to be caused by the velocity of the impact than the spin of the bullet, but I have no idea how much of the fragmentation- if any- is caused by the bullet spin and it would be wonderfully edifying to see a non-spinning bullet impacting another.

If you could take a FPS reading of this standard load, then hand load your 45 to a similar fps at a given Distance with a pure lead composition, I think that’s as close to original as you’d get with 45 caliber. You could try hollowing the bases but I feel like consistency would be difficult?  The ultimate would be to rebarrel your guns to 58. You would have to play with powder loads to achieve velocity at given distances since you’d be using a shorter barrel. The hardest part would be what cartridge to use, if you could use a paper cartridge with your electronic ignition that would be optimal. Maybe that’s too much.   Another thing you could do would Be to shoot like a 56-50 Spencer cartridge. This would get you much closer to the original diameter, and you can buy starline brass.

A piece of steel that will turn 45 degrees Using a basic motor form a RC car would work, if balanced it would not strain too much.  Halfway point notes,  yes, the barrel is designed for the longer round. It is designed like a pistol not a revolver where the round is seated inside the barrel. Using a smaller round will both damage the round and barrel, but also give inconsistent velocities.  Also the reason why the rounds are fused is the distance in which they are fired allowed for the rounds to cool and for both to be moving slower. Since range is unknown i would assume 100 yard from shooters A & B as a good starting point. This also bring in a lot more factors like bullet drop and weather.

@brodiecouch,"‼️Something to take note of: Since the barrels are rifled in the same exact way, yet mirroring one another, the rifling is in two separate directions. This might be leading to just enough torsion between the two bullets that they are fusing and twisting apart simultaneously until heat dissipates and they ultimately are not fused.  Aside from the obvious reason, the wallet might have also played a factor in slowing the twisting action enough via friction without dissipating all the energy needed to fuse.  Edit: as far as I can tell, I can not visibly see any twisting motion on the slow motion as they collide. However, fusion would happen at an atomic scale, so as long as there is a general twisting action at that level, they will not fuse. (it seems there is a microscopic battle between the torsion and the necessary heat required for fusion, whichever ends first determines the outcome)",2년 전(수정됨),1,

@JS-ob4oh,"I think there are 2 things that has to be factored into this regarding the Civil War bullets.  1) We do not know at what range those bullets were fired at. But if the range is sufficiently long, it could mean the velocity they were travelling at the point of impact could be far lower than their muzzle velocity. This could mean there is not a way for your setup to recreate the fusing of the bullets because the distance is too short and there is not a way to lower the powder charge so not to cause a squib (the bullet stuck in the barrel). 2) The pressure differences between modern smokeless powder and the Civil War era blackpowder (gunpowder) would influence the velocity also. Before smokeless powder, there was a limit on how fast you can push the bullet because the high amount of blackpowder given the metallurgy of the period would risk castetrophic failure of  the barrel and chamber. Which is why they use large caliber bullets (for more mass) instead of going for faster velocity to increase kinetic energy.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

The sponsor story was compelling, and was even tied in to the experiment. The storytelling for the video created suspense and while it clearly indicated that MANY small specific engineering details were left out for sake of entertainment and time, it did not leave any unsatisfied curiosities but rather created an aura of slight mystery that so often accompanies joy.

@paulhomsy2751,"They're called Minie balls, not ""miny"". Notice that the spelling is different. Pronounced mee nyay. It's a French word (the name of the inventor of the conical ball).

Prior to this invention balls were all round and lacked precision. The term ball in English comes from ""balle"" which in French implies round ball or as in English any ball to play with, baseball, basketball etc... but is also used to describe a complete round of ammunition which is still called ""balle"". The ""e"" is silent. ""balle de fusil"" means rifle bullet or rifle cartridge interchangeably. The entire cartridge.

As you can see the bullets stuck togather at the museum are longer and after losing approximately the length equal to the slug you are using for energy dessication those stuck togather.....so try some longer bullets like a 45/70 or similar with a thick copper jacket or one with a steel core might also  help in binding,2년 전,0,

@darkxxhimxxlight,"Lead is naturally sticky.... When it's not tarnished. The goal is essentially cold welding. So, one could assume that in the civil war time that they could have JUST made fresh slugs and were dispersed quickly to the soldiers, before they had time to get the film of oxidation on the slugs. So, i say clean the mating surfaces surfaces in hopes that the natural stickiness would act like cold welding. Also, modern lead has zinc in it to keep it from oxidizing, since the bullets would be presumably sitting in storage for some time before use. That zinc also changes the spalling pattern to smaller fragments for maximum damage. I would assume the bullets from back then were pretty close to pure lead, which is like bubble gum at high speeds like this. When it hits its target, it would smush out but stay intact, unlike lead with zinc, which is designed to maximize fragmentation. Looks like you'll have to smelt your own lead slugs to achieve the accuracy of being as close to period correct as possible. You may even buy a genuine civil war era slug and do some kind of purity test on the lead to find how to recreate a period correct recipe for the lead composition.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

That should allow the powder to consistently cover the flash hole due to smaller case volume as well as allowing the bullet to consistently engage the rifling lands and the shorter barrel length should allow lighter loads and lower velocities.   Also, I can't imagine it has much measurable affect but maybe try a slower twist rate on the rifling since the bullets are spinning opposite directions that may play a role in the ability of the bullets to fuse. Research what the typical twist rate was on civil war rifles as well as velocities and see if it is possible to replicate not only the velocities but also the twist rate of the rifling to try and eliminate that factor as well.

@OpenCarryUSMC,"Haven’t read all the comments. But here’s my suggestion, others may have already said it.  The two civil war era bullets were very likely non alloyed lead or, if alloyed, a much softer alloy. Those bullets had to be engaged into the grooves and lands of the rifling by hand and then forced down the barrel with the ram rod. A hard alloy would slow down, or make impossible, reloading. At the least it would slow the COMBAT shooter.  The modern bullets, even those that were not copper jacketed, are modern alloys designed for terminal performance in modern shooting situations. They could be for paper targets for which the alloy would be largely unimportant other than desired density. They could be for hunting or self defense in which case the alloy would be chosen for its ability to retain mass and size while allowing sufficient penetration to cause maximum damage. If they were for “Cowboy” or “dynamic shooting course” use the projectiles would likely be a softer alloy (though likely still harder than Civil War era). Dynamic shooting often involves steel plate targets and soft lead will splatter reducing ricochet hazards.  The copper clad bullets are simply inappropriate choices due to the copper jacket.  I would suggest returning to the museum and asking the curator if they have or can check with the main Smithsonian for any metallurgical data they may have on those fuzed bullets.   In the absence of data on the specific bullets, research on commonly supplied bullets should be available somewhere.",2년 전,0,

@icarusfx84,"It is possible that the original bullets may actually have intersected each other at an angle. This would transfer some of the kinetic energy into the new direction of travel. If you adjusted the angle of intersect to 170 degrees (or more), it might be enough for the bullets to fuse and then redirect their trajectories. It could have been that the bullets on the battlefield were travelling on the same plane, but one soldier was firing to his left and the other to his right. Having the bullets meet head on means all the energy is transferred into the projectiles. Try and bleed some of the energy in the redirection.",2년 전,0,

@SiNNeR90737,@Smartereveryday- I think the shape of the bullet is why it won't fuse together. If you had ball shaped bullets it might of worked. My theory. Is the shape of modern bullets there is more weight in the back of the bullets still pushing the nose foward. If they were round the center of the ball bullet is majority of the weight and that is were the momentum will stop when the center of the ball bullets collide they will effectively have to more weight with foward momentum to keep pushing. There for when the center of the ball bullets meet in the middle the foward moment u m will no longer be forced away from the point of impact. The ball bullets will stop once the center mass of each meet in the middle.

@harveybc,"Extremely interesting and fantastic engineering. As to the fusion of the two bullets, I suspect you are at least partially correct in that it is the bullet material. However the bullet design may have also played a roll.   Bullets of that era were made from pure lead, not alloyed lead used today. Also the bullets most often used were called mini balls. (Think of how you might fire a plastic/paper cup from a gun. The bottom would be forward and and the opening you'd drink from to the rear where the powder is.) This way the bullet could be made slightly undersized to make loading a lot easier. When fired the rear of the bullet would open up creating the seal with the barrel.  Maybe try to find some hollow base wadcutters in that caliber. To get pure lead you might have to cast your own. Lee at least use to make mini ball molds for creating these.  Any one into traditional muzzle loaders should be able to help you out.",2년 전,0,
@fritzs8117,"Pretty cool.  Take-away:  The two civil war bullets did not meet in ""clean air"".  You sort-of proved that in your testing.  Obviously, they did not meet in an aluminum wallet, either.  So what sort of medium would have been present on the battlefield?  A book,  a bundle of clothing. other known ""kit"" that CW soldiers would have been carrying, etc.  Another answer would be ""human soft tissue"", but that's kinda hard to test.  Maybe the Smithsonian bullet has been tested for organic matter coating the bullet(s)?  Paper, leather, etc?  May not be helpful since blood, powder, etc would also test positively as organic, so further testing would need to be done on that sample to determine origin.  Another takeaway:  it would be a miracle that the two war bullets met in the exact middle of their flights.  One bullet likely had far less energy upon impact than the other bullet, having traveled farther to get to the intercept point.   Great video.  Keep experimenting!",2년 전,0,

@JosephParker_Nottheboxer,"My first thought that I don't see that you've covered is lubricants and oils. IF their is a small oil or lubricant layer on the bullet from the barrel, making of the bullets or something that's designed to prevent things sticking, that might be just enough to stop the fusing of the two bullets. Even the oils from handling the bullets might be enough with these smaller bullets to prevent it working. So an acetone cloth to wipe the tips of the bullets down with just before loading might help. Also this makes firing more dangerous as it can have a higher risk of fouling in the barrel.  On a similar note on a few impacts I saw a flash, that's a friction flash that could be oils igniting, or air igniting. I guess the other thing to consider is the leads... a copper jacket would prevent the lead from contacting cleanly so you won't get the fusing.",2년 전,0,

Even with pouring your own lead bullets, you will end up with inconsistent bullet forming that is not 100% concentric that can lead to bullet yawing in flight. Then there is the matter of barrel twist rates, and how the lands and grooves were cut. There's also the primer equation, which there could be small variances in them as well.

@spvillano,"One problem with fusion of the rounds is, civil war bullets were soft lead. Modern bullets use lead-tin-antimony for lead bullets to lower lead fouling of the barrel and also hardens the bullets. I'd doubt the propellant difference of modern smokeless powder vs black powder would make a realistic difference, as that'd be more an acceleration curve while inside the barrel and be irrelevant to the rounds impacting one another. Velocity, as in range the civil war rounds traveled likely was much lower though, as most battles weren't fought at point blank range. So, emulating that, one could use a lower propellant charge and slightly larger bore barrels, while going with pure lead projectiles, as finding non-alloy rounds is beyond unlikely today.",2년 전,0,

@stephenallen9786,What you need to do is try and find out where the lead of the two fused together from back in the day came from then cross reference the exact type of lead from then to today's lead type.

You guys are amazing! BTW your two safety guys would totally get along with our safety guy at Westfall Roofing here in Tampa!  Lol,2년 전,0,

I totally agree safety is #1 and everybody should go out of their way to be as safe as possible. However, you give a safety lecture for half of the video. Is this a video about two bullets hitting each other or a comprehensive firearms safety lecture? You talk about the safety features of your rig more than the actual shot. I hear safety lectures every single gun video I watch. I pretty much know everything possible about firearm safety. For example, every gun video I watch lectures about never standing in the line of fire and having a berm behind to prevent stray bullets from hitting anything behind. So I watch 500 of these videos and hear 10 minutes of gun safety every single time. These videos spends most of the time talking about safety. It's getting REAL old for me. I've heard the safety lecture hundreds of times. Enough. Please. Stop wasting my time with excessive safety content. Briefly mention and explain it, but don't make me take firearm safety 101 AGAIN!

@davidzakrzewicz707,"I haven’t read all the comments and someone may have already said this, but I think your bullets won’t fuse because modern lead bullets are usually an alloy of lead, tin, and antimony to give them hardness , whereas the Minie balls used in many civil war era muskets were more likely to be a more pure form of lead. The skirt of the hollow base of the Minie ball obturated to fill the rifling grooves when pushed forward by the expanding powder gasses, sealing the bore and engaging the rifling to give the projectile rotational stability. The powder used was black powder that varied in consistency and quality of formulation as well as quantity, thus giving a wide range of velocities. I don’t know what the range of those velocities might have been, but suspect that they were slower and more wide ranging than the velocities given by modern smokeless powders. I’m theorizing more than what I know, but wonder if a pure lead bullet propelled at black powder velocity might fuse with its counterpart meeting it from the other direction more readily than a bullet of a lead, tin, antimony alloy.",2년 전,0,

@BernardBonG-r3z,"Very interesting. If I am not mistaken at the time of the original bullet impact they were shooting pure lead without a copper jacket which will have an effect on how the bullets come together. At the time of the original they were shooting a velocity of approximate 1200 fpm to control leading of the rifle barrel. For pistols you may want to be at about 700 to 750 fpm with pure lead By the way the lead can not be pure lead as it will lead up very fast and may distort because of the rifling. The other question would be ""were the rifles smooth bore or rifled""? Just some thoughts but this is still amazing.",2년 전,0,

I couldn't find any reference to the typical additives in civil war era minie balls, but it seems they probably understood the process just as well in 1865 as the at home bullet casters of today.

@robertr4193,I think I may know why the bullets were fragmenting instead of sticking together. Probably two reasons but I think the main reason is that most of the led used on modern led bullets is an alloy to try and make the bullet harder to allow for greater penetration on impact. When the harder alloy hits the same bullet hardness instead of fusing it fragments. If the projectiles were either a more pure led content making it softer it might fuse. Also as close as the two guns are firing the speed is just too great for them to stay together.,2년 전,0,

@mattw.6726,"Question: could a hotter bullet temperature prior to collision make the bullets more likely to fuse?  I'd assume that a longer barrel would both give the powder more burn time and also result in more friction as the bullet's engaging the rifling for a greater length of time.  It may also be worth investigating just how tightly the rifling from a Civil War-era musket grips a bullet and if it's tighter than in modern firearms.  Speaking of rifling, could bullet spin impact the likelihood of the rounds fusing?  If so, it might be worth investigating a lower (or possibly higher) twist ratio.  Similarly, it might be useful to try rifling one of the barrels clockwise and the other counterclockwise to reduce or eliminate the relative spin when the bullets impact.  Taking this further, you could also try using smoothbore barrels, as a quick Google search (which may or may not be accurate) says that both sides had some non-rifled muskets at the start of the war.",2년 전,0,

@mooneym.3642,"Since the first collision and shattering I knew the problem, the reason you are not getting them to stick. Its the heat. Lead melts very easily and those projectiles are not getting the time to dissipate the heat energy they carry from the powder ignition and the friction in the barrel. So, without increasing the distance by elongating the test apparatus you instead have to experiment with the right amount of temperature by, say, cooling the rifles or somehow cooling the lead the right amount before impact to create maybe an even better looking, science assisted bullet congregation.",2년 전,0,

@47f0,"In May of 1654, two teams of fifteen horses each were hitched to  two copper hemispheres that were held together by nothing but air pressure and the vacuum inside them.  The man of presenting the demonstration, Otto von Guericke, was showing off his new vacuum pump. Emphasis on the showing off part, because one of those teams of horses was entirely superfluous - if one of the hemispheres had been tethered to a building or tree, it would have provided the same force with half the number of horses.  While the  theater of two guns firing at each other is not lost on me, the relative velocity which seems to be a problem and probably is considerably higher than Civil War mini balls, could be cut in half and the whole rig greatly simplified by simply mounting one bullet on top of a soda straw and shooting at it.

First, the civil war balls were shot at a much longer distance and will have slowed down considerably when they hit.

Maybe loading with fireworks grade powder would more closely mimic the original. Third, they were made from real lead. I'm not sure that modern ""lead"" bullets are not more pewter than toxic lead. Fourth, I'm not sure that modern bullets don't have some sort of anti friction coating on them to prevent them from sticking in the barrel and slowing down.

@zachaustin5225,"to help with your shattering problem you might want to make sure you're using black powder. It is known for being slower burning than modern smokeless powder. 45 long colt comes in black or smokeless powder loadings. I don't know what you were using before but that could be part of the issue. either way, you may have gotten as close as you can to the lowest velocity possible with you small powder load but it is still something I thought about. It would take a lot more effort on your part but you could also re build your guns using a larger caliber. Many muskets in the civil war used .58 or .577 caliber cartridges. This might allow you have better contact area and generally stronger bullets that won't shatter so easily. Just some ideas for your consideration.

@tomsutcavage114,"My thoughts... 1. test fire once projectile at solid target until you find projectile material and speed that only flattens projectile (does not fragment). Hitting another projectile same size would have same affect.  2. shorten barrel length to slow bullet (trade off with accuracy). Original event was probable at long distance and bullets slowed. Accuracy would be issue to reproduce.  3. place projectile into barrel separate from casing and powder (like a muzzle loader).   More realistic to the story. engage barrel refiling at same point regardless of size of casing.  4. move to inside to eliminate wind and make everything easier. 5. can use less powder if you switch to smooth barrel .  6. image of handgun and bullets laying on table looked to be unsafe.   7. I assume you picked handgun for lower muzzle velocity, while still using a 'gun'.  Do it with firearm used at time of story. Or switch to air pressure to launch projectile . 8. both shields down condition should only occur when ready to fire 9. Alarm when firing if it was more that you two at range. 10.

@bq5575,@smartereveryday I think the fragmentation issue is due to the mass of the bullets. The miniballs used during the civil war were typically .58 caliber or .69 caliber weighing in from around 500 grains to over 700 grains. I think a better analog for what you are trying to achieve would be something like a 12 gauge rifled slug. They are 437.5 grains but have a much larger surface area given that they are around .79 caliber. Also given the ease of reloading shotgun shells it may be easier to produce a reduced load and may also have less chance of a squib given the smooth bore of a shotgun.,2년 전,0,

@spvillano," @tde1964  you can avoid them shooting each other by a longer flight distance, allowing drop to handle the matter for you, but also increasing the precision of the build to allow much greater precision in adjusting the aim to cover the greater range. That said, one wouldn't have to clean the barrel after each shot, but they'd need much more frequent cleaning. One can offset the higher velocity and fouling issue by using a slightly larger bore. Lower friction and cutting by the rifling, gas leakage lowering pressure and hence, velocity, downside is lower accuracy. Chroming the barrel also would lower fouling.",2년 전,6,

@SirSpuddington,"Maybe part of the reason the two bullets that went through the wallet partially fused was not just that the thin aluminum sheet slowed them down enough. One bullet hit the wallet just before the other one did. Maybe that first impact imparted a tiny bit of friction-generated heat to that bullet that softened an outer layer of lead just enough to make it stick to the second bullet in addition to slightly reducing its velocity just before the bullet-to-bullet collision. The two Civil War bullets that combined didn't shatter; they kind of look like they got squished together as if they were Play-Doh. Is it possible that, in addition to being a somewhat different kind/purity of lead and traveling at different velocities than yours, those two bullets were at a higher temperature at the instant of impact than those that you were using, such that the metal was more malleable and less brittle and thus more prone to merging than shattering? The rifles that they were fired out of probably had much longer barrels than your homemade solution (which is ingenious by the way :D ) and therefore probably would have had more heat imparted to them when they left their barrels due to the extra time they had engaged with the rifling.   There are of course a bunch of other variables to consider, such as how far away from each other the two Civil War rifles were when they were fired and how that might affect things, but maybe something to think about?",2년 전,0,

@MrCanadiandad,My suspicion is that the two bullets that fused from the American Civil war were shot from FURTHER distances apart AND WERE FUSED TOGETHER INSIDE A BODY. That way the mass of the body would have held the shrapnel together with the pressure from within the body where the two bullets met. Just a thought. This of course would have made it even much more of a miracle that the two bullets met inside another person. Maybe you guys should test this theory by firing the two bullets into a chunk of ballistic gel??,2년 전,0,

This is due to the rear of the blocker having two almost 45° angled plates that direct shrapnel back towards the gun/loader when only the far one is closed. 2. Blocker(s) should be closed before loading so all shrapnel is angled in the same 90° direction at all times in the closed state (giving a clear no go side of the setup). 3. You should be filming from the other side to prevent entering the no go side defined in #2.  Love you and your content. Thanks and stay safe.",2년 전,0,

@danieladams553,The reason the bullets were fragmenting vs fusing like you wanted is because the minié balls had significantly lower velocity than even other black powder weapons.

@Lilith-Rose,"Even with the lowest level of powder to make it out of the barrel youre still at much higher combined velocities than two bullets hitting at the far end of their reach which you almost certainly already know. The question is how to get a lower velocity and still get the bullet to leave the barrel.. well first logical step after reducing the powder is reducing barrel length, starting with 25% reduction and working your way towards 50 and 75% reduction because that reduced length will reduce consistency but at this point it is your biggest limiting factor regarfing your minimum velocities  Your other course of action is to use ""stickier"" lead. Most lead used in bullets is alloyed to minimise fouling but in this case its the same property that causes fouling that will cause the bullet fusion (essentially cold welding the lead) so a pure soft lead will increase your chances as well",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@Athazago,"There could be two reasons, the bullets didnt fully fuze in mid-air without support.. Either modern gunpowder, or too tiny of a caliber.  The composition of ""gunpowder"" and ""black powder"" are two different recipes. One is made from sulfur, potassium nitrate and charcoal, and the other is made from either nitrocellulose, or a mix between nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin.  Modern gunpowder, aka smokeless powder, is a high explosive and burns way faster, accelerating the lead too fast, resulting in too much kinetic energy on impact, destroying the bullets.  Black Powder is a low explosive, burning much slower, which also means lower muzzle velocities, meaning lower kinetic energy on impact, meaning its a good chance the bullets will fuse.  While I'm nowhere near qualified enough to have any right of statement, I would propose the suggestion of either a bigger caliber, or a slower burning black powder mixture.",2년 전,0,

You also over designed those zip guns as you could have bought a pair of 1851 Navy revolvers, removed or locked down the hammers, removed the nipples and then easily loaded and slid the electronic firing mechanism through the hole for the nipple. There are devices already on the market which allow you to lock a pistol in place for precision firing and zeroing, so you didn't need to waste the time and money on the braces for the zip guns. As for using that huge chunk of metal beam to set the two zip guns up on - another waste of time and money as a solid wood table and a level could have easily done the job. All said, you could have had the rig built safely and properly over the course of a Saturday afternoon and for a fraction of the cost while having the real look and feel of redneck engineering.",2년 전,0,
@DjAboo1,"You might be able to reproduce the impacted projectiles stuck together is you used larger projectiles. The mini balls used during the civil war were .69 caliber for the Harpers Ferry rifle, and .58 caliber for the Springfield design. These are pretty large in diameter compared to modern pistol projectiles. They are also cast lead which bullet molds can be purchased to cast your own. I wouldn’t be surprised if you can find some commercially made these days as well. Slower velocity may help as well, you can down load the powder charge. From searching online, rifled Muskets of the day were capable of firing projectiles at over 1800 feet per second. That is on par with modern hand gun ballistics but slower than a lot of common modern military calibers. Bigger bullets made of more malleable material with more mass moving at a slower speed might be what you need to make the impacting bullets stick.

The other part of the question is why wasn't there a catch can to stop the fragments as they ricocheted off the blocker plate?  As far as your bullets exploding and the civil war bullets welding themselves together, you have two variables to consider, velocity and the alloys of the bullets.

@kjm5448,"Destin, One thought that occurred to me is that since both guns have the same rifling, and one of them if flipped, you also need to worry about the sheer force from the rotation of the bullets spinning to account for with fusing the bullets. Musket balls from the civil war were primarily shot from smoothbores, and therefore didn't have opposite rotation. For the next attempt at fusing 2 bullets, it might help to have a reversed rifling on one of the guns to make the bullets rotate in the same direction, or just shoot them out of a smoothbore and see if you can still get them to be accurate. I know a diablo shaped round is stable in non-rotating flight.",2년 전,0,

At the eutectic with a SnPb ratio of approx. 63% Sn and 37% Pb the melting point of that alloy is the lowest, about 183°C. If you can't reach that temperature with the colliding bullets it might be possible to use a softer  alloy with a higher lead content to achieve something that looks like actual fusion but is actually the softer lead holding on to each other. On this note it would be interesting to know if those civil war bullets actually melted together or just ""stick"" together really strongly.",2년 전,0,
@martinfyhn1976,"As you mentioned, metal composition and speed are likely important factors. In some first shots, the colours of some of the metal fragments made me think of Bismuth crystallizing. I know that Bismuth is used as a lead replacement some places, because it's less toxic, but I have no idea if this also goes for bullets - it likely doesn't, because of the low melting point of Bismuth.  (The following is not meant to have subtext. I don't know how to communicate it clearly without using the words I've used, so please excuse me) Also, shape and size might be important. With more material, there's more material to hold the things together. Also, they were referred to as ""minié balls"", and a ball might be able to stick together more, because it doesn't have a cylindrical shape behind it, so it's not adding equal amounts of material for the duration of impact. However, looking at the bullets in the beginning of the video, it does look like they used to have more of a bullet shape, than a ball shape. But maybe they had a much smaller cylinder-to-sphere-ratio, than the bullets used in this video.",2년 전,6,

Because there's certainly a chance that some poor soldier got hit by both enemy and friendly fire at the same time, giving both bullets a bit of a slowdown and puts mass around the bullets to keep them from shattering so much…  It'd also mean they are cooled by, essentially, body warm water instead of air. The higher heat transfer coefficient would cool down the lead faster.   Basically, perhaps you should try firing into ballistic gel. Or, since tunnelling through the gel is likely to divert the bullets, make a path through the gel for the bullets to enter through and only use the fact that they aren't free to shatter and can cool down faster.",2년 전,0,

If you are worried about casting inconsistencies, you could build a centrifugal mold and use centrifugal casting, or, if you need more precision than this, just turn them on a lathe (maybe overkill).  Either way, I would probably anneal some bullets, to see if the dead soft lead sticks better.  If all the above still is not enough, I might remove the oxide layer (probably with an acid dip - vinegar should work), and maybe flux them if even the acid dipped, annealed, pure lead was not enough.

@ArsonalTech,"TL;DR: Buy a Hybrid wallet from KingsLoot. Easiest wallet for finding the right bills, better deployment of cards than Ridge. Doesn’t deface credit cards like a Ridge will.   I had an aluminum ridge wallet back when they were a lot cheaper. I switched to the KingsLoot Hybrid which is about the same price as a Ridge or cheaper. The reasoning is that you’ll have to get new cards ever 1 to 2 years with a Ridge because they scratch against each other. There’s no soft leather protecting them from each other. So you can still have 3 cards you most frequently use deploy quickly, and instead of having a money clip where you have to pull all your money out and find the right bills and then fold them back up and slide them into the clip, you just open your wallet like a book, and tab through the bills until you find the right ones. Their customer service is great too. The first one I bought, the pull tab broke on the second time I used it.

The 2 bullets from the Civil War hit each other at a much lower velocity and less power than the 2 in the video, but were still capable of doing devistating damage to the object they hit, usually an enemy soldier in this case.  The 2 bullets in the video had so much more power and speed that they exceeded the bullets ability to survive the impact of another bullet also traveling at the same speed. However, both bullets were hit at twice their own speed and twice their own energy. Therefore, neither of the bullets survived the impact intact.",2년 전,0,

@PanicProvisions,"Three relevant factors: - How fast they are - How well they stick - How massive they are With factors 2 and three not being wholly independent, since they are both influenced by the material and size of the projectile. Some ideas: Speed - use a ballistics gel target (may also help w/ stick), put the guns closer together and use less gunpowder, use shorter barrels. Stick - Put impurities into the lead that make it even softer to make it fuse instead of fragmenting or go the opposite route and use something much harder and stable to stop it from fragmenting altogether or mix both approaches so one almost passes through the other, until it loses enough speed to have the rest stick to it (least promising approach, but possible and would be cool if it works) Mass - If you use a larger caliber with less gunpowder, it will be affected less by air resistance and lose its low speed less rapidly. It also contain more binding energy and be less likely to explode all over the place. Sadly, this advantage could be offset by it also getting a larger transfer of kinetic energy due to the higher inertia of the colliding bullet. So going smaller might actually help more than it hinders.  Be that as it may, amazing video, I hope you don't mind my musings. Thanks for the great content, as always.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

There was a small museum there and I hope it is still there, that also had a mini ball collision pair on display.  I remember being very, very impressed with it, enough that I recall it to this day.  The one they had looked more like the one Destin is holding at 34:08 than the one in the Smithsonian.  It had the star pattern rather than the smoother edged one the Smithsonian has.

@donrofkar946,"If the historic bullet had to align within .050” of another, there are 57,600 points in a single square foot.  If battle accuracy was a very optimistic 3’ x 3’ square, that’s 518,400 points that each rifle is firing at.  The odds of both hitting the same point is 1/57,600.   What are the odds the timing will be the same within even within 1 second?  In a 16 hr battle there are 57,600 seconds, so it’s 1/57,600 for each shot.   1/57,600 x 1/57,600 is 1/3.3^9.    A civil war soldier could only fire once every 15 seconds at most or 3840 shots.  That’s a probability of .00000116 per day, not taking into account angle of fire or ballistics or odds both bullets are capable of bonding together, which would take the odds truly into outer space.  However, at Gettysburg 7 million bullets fired by 160,000 soldiers is only about 44 shots per soldier for the entire 3 days.

@enscroggs,"I'm pausing at 21:20. I haven't seen any part of this video past this timestamp. I want to inject my thoughts so far. In your best collisions so far, those closest to the nose-to-nose dead on ideal,  the bullets are shattering rather than melding into a solid mass like the Civil War two minié bullets. Why? My hypothesis has three factors: the velocities, the angle of collision, and the metallurgy of the bullets. To get the final result, you must replicate the Civil War situation as closely as possible. Both the Yanks and the Rebs used the same caliber and the same metal, a soft lead that was easy to cast around a campfire, whereas your modern factory-made .45 Long Colt projectiles are cast from a harder alloy designed to leave very little lead fouling in the barrel. When fired against plate steel, these bullets ""splash"" almost like they're liquid. A sufficiently soft lead alloy for this experiment should mushroom into a disc. The Civil War armies used black powder, i.e. charcoal, sulfur, and potassium nitrate, which produces relatively slow muzzle velocities and low chamber pressures. The kinetic data for the .58-caliber Springfield 1861 is probably available through one or more reenactor websites. Finally, you'll probably need to lose that offset angle.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

Civil war era bullets are usually cast from pure lead which is much more malleable than the harder and more brittle lead alloys from which  modern bullets are cast.  Pure lead also has a lower melting point which would also make it more likely to fuse at the temperatures generated by the collision.

@randalldunning5738,"Viewing this as someone working in the discipline, this was a GREAT video. I will be sharing this with our lethality team.   Modern cast projectiles are made of lead, zinc, and antimony. The lead provides the weight, the zinc improves shape consistency and complete filling of the mold, and the antimony provides hardness. Civil War Minnie balls were likely pure lead. Modern bullets are also swaged which also aligns the “grain” of the metal. Since modern bullets are “hard” due to hard alloy and swaging, they shatter upon impact rather than fusing.   Also, smokeless  (cordite) propellants  are more brissiant than civil war era black powder. Check the pressure curves of cordite vs black powder to mimic Civil War projectile muzzle velocities.

@bobsmith6079,Modern bullets are made with an alloy of lead and antimony which produces a less ductile and malleable metal than pure lead which causes less fouling of the barrel or leading making it easier to clean but it causes the bullets to shatter into dust rather than fuse together. Using pure lead should be more successful than the modern bullets but the most ductile and malleable metal is gold and one gram of gold can be drawn into a wire over 2 kilometers in length and gold can be rolled into sheets thin enough to transmit light.

It may not be possible to do this while they are flying in the air, but let's say if the ammo was in an ammo cache, the fact that they are bunched up together may allow for the bullet to stay together long enough for it to cool down and fuse. Having said that it is far more likely that the specific example shown is simply a forgery (literally), it's already unimaginably unlikely that two people firing at each other would be able to do it so perfectly for them to hit each other in mid-air, not to mention make it hot enough for them to melt together and yet cool down fast enough before they get split apart.

@permutatechguy,"Chamber size matters, this is why a .223 is more accurate then a 5.56 chamber. The .223 Wylde chamber offers a compromise. Also you have to deal with pressures in the chamber. You can’t just shorten a chamber either without understanding the peak pressures made by the type of powder you are using. The gap that the bullet jumps in a 5.56 chambering, also called the throat of the chamber being the distance between where the bullet leaves the case and engages the rifling, is critical to the pressure curve. If you put a 5.56 in a .223 chamber, the gun will eventually suffer a failure due to the pressures.   Now one question I have always had is about stabilization. There are 3 offerings of twist rate for at-15 style rifles that shoot a 5.56. The original twist rate offered in the M-16 rifle length gas systems of Vietnam. Then you have the twist rates of today offered for the M-4 carbine which is 1/7 but is also using a 14.5 in barrel. Now for civilians, who don’t want to pursue tax stamps we will run a 16 inch barrel. My question. Does a 5.56 or .223 have the same stabilization when shot out of a 16 inch barrel with a 1/8 twist rate as the same rounds shot out of a 14.5 inch barrel with a 1/7 twist rate? I am genuinely curious because the rounds have the same amount rotations in the barrel. Both make two complete revolutions in the barrels. Also what is the stabilization characteristics of different grain offerings out of 1/7, 1/8, and 1/9.   Do we as civilians buy 1/7 twist rates for no reason. I assume the acceleration through a tighter twist rate effects stabilization. But how much?",2년 전,0,

@EightBawl," @miza6   I was referring to differences in temp from shot to shot, regardless of how long between them. Barrel temp affects accuracy from shot to shot. If you sight in a  gun at a certain temp, then shoot the gun again 6 months later when the temp outside and of the barrel is completely different, the accuracy will be slightly different. I admit that I'm talking about MUCH longer ranges than Destin is working with AND that ambient air temp can and probably does affect the bullet over those ranges much more also. You're probably right though.",2년 전,0,
@Surajraeela,i think the problem was short barrel. maybe long barrel would have given accurate result in less itteration. they used a long barrel gun in world war (maybe). longbarrel would reduce speed due to friction and it would also be accurate (im making this assumption in middle of watching this video maybe you might have did that at the end) but still its awesome.,2년 전,0,

@donrofkar946,"If your test showed a low velocity pistol cartridge had to be reduced to little more than a squib load and still didn’t leave much of the bullet intact, perhaps the original fused bullets weren’t as authentic as the museum was led to believe.  The probability of the alignment with anything short of a carefully controlled situation is very low.  Very very low.   Doing this at battlefield rifle range is much much more difficult.  Then having equal momentum when fired with two different rifles takes those probabilities to an even higher level.  Even if a million rounds were fired in a battle, what are the odds 500k firing events would be able to meet the criteria to fuse bullets - compare that with the odds of someone faking a “one in a million” fused bullet, when counterfeiting civil war era items is one of americas favorite past times.  Your test shows it takes relatively low velocity - I can’t help wondering if those velocities could replicated without shooting them from a gun by someone in a garage 200 years ago.  There were many pistols of that era with two barrels that fired with one cap and anyone with a black smithing forge could form a couple of rifle barrels so they curved and pointed at each other and the bullets don’t have to be seated completely at the breach.  The low velocities might not have even involved black powder.  A burst of steam, or flammable liquid or gas could produce what are essentially pellet gun velocities.  Guys who searched battle sites for anything they could sell would all have plenty of relatively intact bullets to experiment with, or just cast bullets from an old mold.  As a kid we used to dig Calvary bullets out of a nearby hillside that was used for target practice and many of those could easily be reloaded.  I’m excited to see round two of these experiments with pure lead used - I’m betting the softness will require such low velocities that it will essentially disprove the authenticity of the original museum piece.",2년 전,0,

I have fused 22lr to a steel target when shooting long range because they are going so slow at that point that the disk doesnt completely fragment.  9mm also does the same.  Really all you did was capture smashing bullets but its nothing amazingly different from what all shooters knew was happening and shooting steel has been captured alot.  Also another solution for the bullet having to jump to the rifling would be to turn down the back of the chamber thus letting the bullet casing get closer to the lands and you would be able to use the shorter cases. If you cant bring the lands to the bullet bring the bullet to the lands.  You can also alter the set depth of the bullet in the case but there is only minor adjustment to be had there. Precision loaders  have been doing this for years for precise shots and you actually tailor a bullet load to a SPECIFIC gun.,2년 전(수정됨),0,

My only question, and it is truly a question seeking an answer not trying to mitigate all you put into this but wouldn't the rifling of the barrels making the bullets spin in opposite directions make them less likely to stick together? I know that in order to counter that you would have to have a custom made barrel with it in reverse, but I feel like that would make the metal be traveling in the same direction in at least one aspect and then it would hold together better. I know that if someone glued something to something else and asked me to get it apart the first thing I would do would be to twist in opposite directions and I feel like the bullets are doing the same thing.

On Destins slower attempts (26:43 and 26:48) his bullets traveled at around 140 m/s with approximately 400 +-10 rotations per second .

The wallet thing also raises the question that maybe the example in the Smithsonian that kicked all this off might itself have only happened because one bullet went through something before it hit the second bullet? Regardless, I'm sure it'll be a fun ride and we'll all learn a lot from these amazing experiments!",2년 전,18,

The more they travel through the air, the more friction there is  and the more it’s gonna heat up.

@MrKingdavis13, @danieldonaldson8634  Most people that have never shot a slug through a shot gun or really old smooth bore musket don't understand how accurate they are at short ranges.  The rifling really helps for longer ranges and since both barrels are rifled in the same direction but being projected at each other the force would multiply not cancel out.  For that one would have to spin clockwise and the other counter clockwise at the same rate.  Trust me at 2 meters the smooth bore will not effect accuracy and the shot is really only about half that for this set up.,2년 전,0,

Experiments with dead soft pure lead, and then perhaps an alloy of 20:1, or 20 parts pure lead to 1 part pure tin would be first in my mind. I believe the 20:1 was used in Civil War era black powder cartridges to some extent.

@jp040759,Mini balls were made with pure lead.   At least as pure as they could make back then.     The other factor I believe is the conical slugs have  hollow bases.   Kind of a bucket shape or skirt.   The modern stuff is solid and a harder lead alloy and it is doing what it is designed to do.  Penetrate.   The mini balls nose was fairly solid but the rest of the slug is like a skirt and it collapses on itself easier than a solid lead bullet.   Being hollow thin walls it would absorb the collision and reduce the amount of lead trying to penetrate.    Kind of like a crumple zone in a car.    Some bullet energy would be transformed to deformation and heat from friction of deformation.    The over all mass of the slugs is higher too so there is more lead mass to deform also.   45 slugs are like 250 grains.   Mini ball slugs are 1.14 ounces or about 500 grains of lead.    My 2 cents.    Another thing I recall from old reloading manuals was when guys would reload lite loads they used cotton of synthetic stuffing to fill the empty space in the case to keep the powder pack consistent inside the case up against the primer hole for more consistent ignition and burning rates.   I think the stuffing would burn up upon ignition.,2년 전,0,

Maybe the right-hand bullet was fired from farther away than the left one and its nose was pointed farther downward?  Variables, variables, variables!

Back in the civil war, it was likely pure lead or something close to it. I suggest casting pure lead bullets and trying again at probably around 600-700 fps. I bet you might get a fusion. If not, you might need a larger and heavier caliber.  ALSO, you might need to thoroughly clean the barrels after 10 or so round of pure lead. It's messy.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@anteshell,"19:32 That's not quite accurate.  The direction of the scatter plane around the axial direction (the axis along the barrels) is defined by the direction of the bullets' offset around the axis, but the angle is not the same as the tangent of point of impact. That is because the disintegration of the bullet is not instant, but happens over a period of time and continuous contact with constantly changing opposing forces due to deformation. Especially the normal force in the point of impact. Also, that particular force is much weaker then inertial force along with the axis travel direction. Etc, etc...   The phenomenon is helluva complex thing quite unlike for example shooting an armoured steel plate. The claim you  make is a sufficient approximation for people who are not interested in the nitty gritty detail, but you never were that guy yourself so I'm wondering why you don't go into further detail into that.  22:09 But this must be one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen.

@alexthedonutslayer591,"There are two things that I've noticed, and which could be responsible for the problems with the bullet fusion.  1. You're shooting a bullet directly at another bullet, with nothing but air in-between. All the energy in those bullets is dumped into one another, so it's only natural that they will shatter. Instead of trying to shoot the bullets slower, try having them meet in a different medium that is soft enough to allow penetration, but hard enough to deform the bullet, such as gelatin. This way, the bullets can slow down enough to not shatter, and the expansion process begins before they hit one another, which will give them more surface area to fuse to.  2. You're shooting modern bullets. Civil war era bullets were made of pure lead, and they were most likely cast. Modern age bullets are made of lead-antimony alloy, and they are made via different drawing and stamping procedures from billets. It is possible that your bullets won't fuse because not only are you using a more brittle alloy, but that alloy is also work-hardened. Sure, the modern, work-hardened alloy might not be significantly harder or more brittle than the original, pure lead, cast bullets, but I think that it's a big enough difference to cause problems at those speeds.",2년 전(수정됨),1,

@RyoHazuki224,"Huh. I would have figured the easiest way to line up two barrels would be to use a strait rod in the barrels to make sure they are ""true"" to each other. But, yeah I can kind of see why you would want them slightly off angle to each other, since you don't want to accidentally destroy one of the barrels in the event of a misfire.  But yeah, i'm thinking the composition of the lead we use today in bullets are a lot different than what they used during the civil war. I'm no metallurgist but I would think that they are somehow more malleable, like clay (not exactly clay of course), and not so rigid. Maybe back then they just had a lot more impurities in the lead? Plus, yeah the gunpowder they used was quite different and the velocity was much slower too. And, I'm figuring the two that are fused in the museum were probably shot from a lot further distances so they also probably lost a lot of velocity by the time they hit.  So many variables to account for, but this has been something that I've been wanting to see for SOOOOO long! Its something that I kinda wished that the Mythbusters did back in the day like when they went to test bullet myths from movies, like ""can you curve a bullet"", because I""m pretty sure at some point there was a movie about someone that can stop someone's bullet by firing his own bullet into it.

@gadget6623,"One interesting thing I was thinking about was the rifling. The bullets are counter rotating with respect to each other. That is going to create shear at the point of impact. If the civil war guns were worn down or low spin,  it may have helped  the fusion.   You could do a smooth bore air system and control the pressure as the accelerant. Over a short distance, it may not matter.  It makes it safer too as you can leave the system uncharged until you're ready.",2년 전,0,

But one thing you showed here is that many could have been saved or killed by deflecting bullets in flight by hitting other bullets. But one suggestion, if you try this again, use only pure lead bullets and the old Black Powder (BP) instead of the Smokeless propellant. About 22 to 28 grains of FFFG BP or  Piordex P would have been the standard pistol load back during the Civil War. You should the .44 Round ball for the Remington Revolver that are .454 size as they are .45 caliber. You could also find .45 conical bullets in pure lead. If you were using a lead alloy in this video, that may have been the problem as to why they were not fusing together. If you decide to try this again with BP and pure lead. You can cut the powder charge down a bit if need be. When I was stationed in North Carolina at Seymour Johnson AFB back in the late 1970's, some of the places I would stop at that had some odds and ends to sell. One of the things I would see was a section of a tree that would have a Civil War Bullet embedded from that time. During a battle the trees would get hit and over the following years the tree would grow around the bullet. Some of the loggers or lumber mills would run the logs through a metal detector and if they got a hit they would try and cut that section out for the tourist or visitors to buy. Don't know if they are still finding them and I kind of wish I bought one. Great video and I hope you try this again.",2년 전,0,

Reducing the amount of modern powder in the case solved part of the powder type differential, now the research begins on what the lead alloy actually was. One more thought before I end this comment, what was the barrel chamber temperature? A rifle fired several times during a battle will get subsequently warmer with each shot down the barrel... see where I'm going with this line of inquiry? Since there is absolutely no possible way to determine when in the battle this melding happened, that's just one more wild card in the formula... or is it?

@SBDScott,"In the Civil War, pure lead is what was used/available for the bullets. They wanted the balls to deform, and flatten out quickly to cause a wider, more devastating wound channel, transferring energy as quickly as possible. Most people shooting cast lead nowadays, are handloading for a hunting/wilderness protection round. More modern cast lead bullets are an alloy, resulting in a much harder, albeit more brittle lead. This makes for a better penetrating, narrower wound channel, to penetrate to the vital organs of large game, like a moose, or brown bear. Using the lower velocity loads you were making, with a pure lead projectile would, I believe result in the fusing of the lead together. The newer lead loading bullets you are using are too hard and brittle, so are fragmenting instead of being malleable enough to collide, and melding together. Awesome video as always.

The civil war bullets were probably fired from a way longer distance giving them time to slow down, while possibly heating the tips due to air friction (the heating up part is an more of an assumption than an educated guess here). The other thing is the larger calibre which would give them more mass and length to allow the force of the impact to dissipate. You’ve guys have probably thought about this already but just thought I should put it there just in case. Maybe a bigger calibre for force dissipation might help y’all achieve the fusion.

Musket shots have a poorly measured amount of poorly burning powder with poorly manufactured barrels and poor purity lead.  I think your going to need to consider getting rid of the rifling because the spinning bullet is imparting forces.  Use colder powder because the hot powder is causing the bullet to move too fast and to heat up too much.  Lastly, you're going to need to play with the purity of your lead to make sure that the hot lead is malleable and not brittle.",2년 전,0,

What about having a long barrel tube, and just fire the bullets from both ends?  Also, does the tube actually need to rifled at all given that the projectiles are not needed to fly in the air - the main reason for rifling?  So, a perfectly formed, perfectly parallel-sided long rifle barrel with no rifling, and firing mechanisms at both ends?  That way, they don't even need to be aimed at each other - they ARE each other - it's one barrel.

BUT ----  I can't help wondering if such well-considered, planned, executed, evaluated and presented studies like this won't contribute to the further normalization of the American relationship with firearms.  Handguns have only one purpose -- to end a life. They're very efficient at it. 50,000 Americans die each year from gunshot, including 2000 school children.  In Switzerland 1 or 2 die each year.  14 in New Zealand.  Every post-industrial western democracy experiences less than 200 gunshot deaths each year.  Except us.  Why is that?  [Rhetorical question;  I already know the answer].  This video just might make a few people a little less gun-shy, to coin a phrase. These few reformed snowflakes may buy guns. If they're typical Americans most, but not all of them will store their guns properly, i.e. locked up.   There will inevitably be a few of these new guns left lying around to be discovered.  Maybe one of them will be found by its owner's 4 year old grandson, who shoots his 2 year old sister.  I saw this early in my practice of Emergency Medicine 40 years ago, so a pooh-poohing dismissal of me won't register.

@Bespelled22,It seems another element of what allowed the civil war bullets to fuse is that the distance from which they were fired allowed them to loose some of their energy before impact. Perhaps you could calculate the possible energy loss at a hypothetical distance in order to determine a more ideal velocity at impact. according to a quick google search the 1861 Springfield had a muzzle velocity of around 1000 fps and an effective range of 200 yards.,2년 전(수정됨),0,

You fire 1 rifle at the paper, then adjust the laser pointer to match the hole. Repeat for second rifle. Looks like you got pretty close without that idea though.  I wonder about the caliber you choose. I read that the civil war bullets that hit each other were .69 & .58 caliber, giving you a bigger surface area.  Also that the type of bullets were what's called Minie balls, which are hollow based and designed to expand. Maybe making it easier to fuse as the base wraps around the head.  Lastly, I think you can engineer what speed the original bullets were going by pressing two bullets together with a hydraulic press until you get the desired flatness, measuring the pressure used, then reverse engineer the speed of each bullet, and then how much grain to use.

@evanmorgan6982,"Ok Destin, you have made such an amazing video I have a few potential improvements for you.  Exhibit A, civil war rifles were primarily smooth bore, this would make the projectile fly almost perfectly without rotation, I believe the counter rotation of the two projectiles may have caused them (once they contact) to shear apart especially for heavier bullets that require faster rotation.  Exhibit B, civil war bullets made in a factory were preferably made of lead but given supply being cut off for one reason or another soldiers would be forced to mold their own from ultimately anything but the preference was to use pewter dinnerware. this is not a lead bullet but an alloy of 85%-99% tin, containing different amounts of lead, antimony, silver, bismuth and other metals depending on the purpose, of course I'm not a scientist so I can't provide you with any exact numbers but I know this would vary the fusion temperature/ force, as well as the ability to resist shear force within the metals. I hope this message reaches you someway and I hope that this allows you to succeed in your mission of fusing two bullets in flight.

@dragondemonsyne,"I'm going to suspect the reason you never got the bullets to fuse is that you are using rifled barrels. Those barrels are probably  rifled in the same ""handedness"", so since the bullets are traveling in opposite directions, they are spinning in opposite directions relative to each other. This is creating a great deal of shear, preventing the bullets from fusing.  (The Civil war saw the first introduction of rifled barrels part-way thru, it's possible the fused minnie-balls were fired from unrifled muskets)   You could try either unrifled barrels, or use barrels with rifling of opposite ""handedness"" .

@owned323,"As a reloader and competition shooter your theories on the velocity and how the powder charge works is incorrect my friend. I shoot a 6BRA and I ""jump"" the bullet 60 thousandths off of the lands of the barrel. This is done because at this point the bullet is exiting the barrel in tune with the harmonic whip of the barrel. The powder is then tuned from there. Usually 80% charges actually work best, however this does change based on caliber and what the barrel you are using likes. Generally speaking though a case that is maxxed to 100% powder volume will not shoot as good as a case that is at 80% case volume, just to give some hypothetical numbers. My powder charge is 30.2gr of powder with a seating depth of 1.7950 base to bullet ogive and I have a case volume max of 39gr. Tuning the load is your best friend in this test and measuring powder to an accuracy of .02gr rather than .1gr. Fantastic content though my friend.

@Rated314,"So I've got a theory regarding fusion.  Civil War era arms were rifled at the end, but smooth bore at the beginning.  If the bullets were smooth bore and spherical, the point of impact may cause an exothermic reaction. (I don't know if lead does... so feel free to correct) Im thinking along the lines of hitting two smooth steel spheres together to burn a hole in paper.  Now if this premise is accurate, what is missing to create a fuse set of bullets is the heat from an exothermic reaction. Being spherical decreases the surface area of the point of impact, which would then lead to more energy transferred (in theory creating more heat)... which if I am correct, seems like it could surpass the threshold needed to particially and momentarily liquify the lead....

@OriginalLictre,"In attempting to duplicate a historic curiosity of ballistics, perhaps an examination of the specific style of projectile would be relevant.    The Miniet ball was a vastly different projectile compared to modern projectiles, being distinctly more massive, with a cavity at the back, which was originally intended to have a powder charge, and function similarly to a gyro-jet munition.  It was discovered that the powder charge was being expended when fired, but the design of the projectile itself helped it far more effectively engage the rifling of the weapon, resulting in better gyroscopic stabilization, and prevented gasses bypassing the projectile, resulting in higher velocities.  I think the mass and shape of the projectiles may be directly relevant to the attempt to achieve projectile fusion.",2년 전,0,

@johnfriend862,"Modern cast bullets contain lead, tin and antimony. Bullets from the civil war era were pretty much solid, soft lead. Solid lead leaves a lot of fouling in the barrel, which is why they started mixing tin and antimony into the lead, to make the bullets harder and less prone to fouling. The reason you're not getting that two bullets to fuse together like in the museum is that they're too hard and brittle, hence the shattering.  There were cases in the civil war where a soldier would go to quickly reload, the fresh powder would hit the hot lead fouling and set off the powder as it went down the barrel. Modern cast bullets still foul barrels, but not like the old solid lead bullets. If you could find some pure, soft lead and cast your own bullets you might get the fusing together you're looking for. However, you'll need to clean your barrels regularly, or the lead fouling will affect your accuracy. Do not use old wheel weights, as they contain tin and antimony to make them withstand the rigors of being a wheel weight. In fact, wheel weights are almost the perfect blend to make modern cast bullets.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

I watched a video a few years back of a gentleman loading and firing an original antique Jaegar rifle... There was a rough spot in the bore that would tear the patches and cause inaccuracies. His solution was to load the powder charge, then load a measure of semolina on top of the powder before loading the patched ball. This acted as a spacer and moved the patch/ball combo up past the rough section of the bore without leaving a dangerous air gap between the powder and patch/ball.

If you would cut down on the gun powder in the charges, the collision would be slower as well.

Was cool seeing the bullets collide and shatter, though might have liked seeing a close look at some of the ones that didn't quite meet head on, though I imagine those are likely lost somewhere in the woods.  As for further experiments with this. I'd say try looking more to the kind of guns and ammo they used in the Civil War. I could be wrong as I am no historian, but I believe most rifles back then were in fact smooth bore as Rifling was still a brand new and highly under used concept at the time. Also, they were likely still using the old round/ball shot rather than the more modern style bullets.   Granted, I can only imagine trying it this way, would just make the experiment even more impossible, as the combination of smooth bore and round shot (IE your typical Civil War Musket) would likely make both guns incredibly inaccurate. Thus making the likely chance of the shots even glancing off each other even worse. Unless maybe... the ends of the barrels were just mere inches from each other. Maybe about 5ft at most.",2년 전,0,

@Monkeyboy1995project,"The problems that your running into this experiment are a number of things. so when it comes to aiming you cant just aim in a straight line with two lasers and call it good. You have to make mathematical calculations when dealing with external ballistics and ballistic coefficient of each particular round of ammo. this includes projectile weight, type of powder,  type of casing, length of casing, and primer. because of physics the bullet starts to travel at an arc even at short distances. But projectiles this close are still technically climbing in their arc of travel.        with the rifling part. that comes down to case length and the head spacing. like you mention why the bullet jump or like you said the fire ball comes out before the projectile comes out is because a seal wasn't formed to create the needed back pressure behind the projectile as it travels through the rifling. You said that you friend reloads as a hobby??? he should know all of this if that's what he does, or what he's  doing for this project.   You two need to have firearm experts to help you with this experiment because you said you two are having inconsistences which you seems like to me you haven't figured it out yet because of the complex math that's involved with this, but not only that using an actual firearm would work out ore in your favor as they are design with that indented purpose already and they are much more safer than the Jerry rigged nonsense of barrels and rifling",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@hazerdoescrap,"You're comparing apples and oranges.  Yes the composition of the ""lead"" is different, but the dynamics of the propellant as well as the ballistics given your choice of barrel length will play havoc with the equations.  The rifling difference between a Civil War era rifle with a minie ball vs modern standards shouldn't be too big of a change (there are still differences though) but the softer composition of the round can result in a better gas seal for the round, the extra barrel length will change the expected speed as well as the plasticity of the round after it has left the end and the slower burn/lower pressure of Black Powder vs Smokeless..... That's just ""firing from the hip"" variable wrangling....  Also, why not use a laser bore sight to get the guns aimed? You had a card at the desired impact point.... drop in a laser bore marker and then match them up on the impact card and lock everything down?  My initial thought was to have a bore laser on one end and a photo diode in the other gun so you know they're aimed directly at each other, but you did make a very good point about the slightly offset angle for hardware safety... ;) Good call.",2년 전,0,

@T_Burd_75,"Do you realize that this experiment debunked the Civil War myth about the two bullets colliding in mid-air? What most likely happened was someone took a musket bullet and stuck it in a hole in a target, then shot at it with another musket until they hit it. That would cut the velocity in half which is most likely going to keep both bullets from disintegrating. If you try that, I'm sure it will reproduce the two bullets that are stuck together. Made for a good war story, though. Also, with the powder/case capacity problem, an old trick is to add the powder charge to the case, then fill the case with a buffer, like poly fill from a pillow or something. I used to do that with smokeless loads in a 40-82 WCF. That will hold the powder against the flash hole for more consistent ignition. I would also recommend fully prepping the cases, trimming all to same length/ deburring the mouths, and also deburring the flash holes and  cutting the primer pockets to the same depth and square with the case head. One last thing; a good, heavy crimp on the bullet will ensure a consistent starting pressure. I always recommend seating and crimping in separate operations, so you're not still trying to seat the bullet while the crimp shoulder is trying to crimp the case against the bullet. Hopefully you're weighing everything; cases, bullets, powder (not using a powder measure - even the best powder measures will have a little variation).

@stevenjeffrey4637,One thing that I did not expect  but found very interesting. Usually when you see a bullet impact something you see the fragments moving at about the same speed that the bullet was travelling.

I guess that makes complete sense because the amount of energy on impact is 2x the energy of each individual bullet.  It was all so cool to watch.,2년 전,0,

Back then those Minié balls were made of pure lead, not an alloy. Judging by their appearance being fused together, they were probably only traveling at about 100 or so fps when they collided. The black powder they used then was far less powerful than modern day propellents. So you had a real miracle when those two Minié balls hit each other, fired from rifled muskets, using black powder, probably traveling along a rainbow shaped trajectory.

Place a small plastic container in between with 2 holes on each sides so that the bullets can enter the container. Close the holes with some thin plastic paper/sheet. Fill the container with water.

Pure lead was standard pre-smokeless powder and used to be pretty common in cowboy action rounds.  Might want to consider bumping up the mass too. 45 caliber was a pistol caliber in the civil war, the rifles shot something like 68. It might help keep everything together.  On another note.

At least that may hint to you around what force is required to achieve fusion. Also i think it will be a narrow range of force as to deform but not break apart.  I think its possible to calculate that, lead yield strength is 5,5 MPs witch is 55 joules, witch 16,5g bullet generate at 280 fps. That 45 is around 900 fps. If i am theorizing right, loads lower then half dont push the bullet out of the barrel and you need bit less the 1/3.",2년 전,0,

@jofher007,"I think the reason you guys didn't succeed from having to bullets impacting and staying together is  Because you guys set up the entire shooting test set up too closed to each other + the rounds are still traveling at really high speed.  Back in the Civil war they use Soft lead not quench in water so the bullets stayed soft. Also I think the Two bullets you watched at the museum where shot from a Muzzeloader rifle perhaps a .58 or .69 caliber traveling 1,200 fps or more. But You need to add the Distance the shots were placed and timed them and at the end you'll see that these Two rounds perhaps ended up crashing to each other at very slower speed and getting stuck together.",2년 전,0,

An unknown duo of opposing men, would fire their muskets with lethal intent. Yet despite all odds, the two rounds would meet. Halted then fused- a union complete.

Tin reduces surface tension of the molten lead, allowing better mold fill out. Antimony is added to make the bullets harder. It also make the bullets brittle.  Get some pure lead and pure tin.

@brians1793," @TheGuzzmeister  Another factor could be distance, could be much too close here, the Civil War bullets could have been quite a bit farther apart but with similar energy as it looks pretty symmetrical. Maybe using black powder, muzzle loading with ball rounds would be the way to go with a smooth bore, and you could experiment with different amounts of powder for the right amount of energy rather than increase or decrease distance. Another idea is just use shotgun slugs, maybe hand-loaded with lead balls and smooth bore. Maybe even .410 for a similar size as .45 Colt, not sure what caliber ball rounds they would have used in the Civil War I guess it would make more sense to use something similar.  Besides the type of lead too, maybe controlling the temperature of the lead could help, I'd think it'd soften the lead and make it less likely to explode into fragments and more likely to fuse together.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

Since each bullet is rotating the same direction compared to it's barrel, the bullets are rotating opposite directions when they impact, causing them to shear apart?  They rotate clockwise when viewed from behind.  I looked up Minie balls and they were apparently also rifled, so perhaps it's not this, but perhaps the rifling wasn't as strong back then, and being farther apart, and a larger bullet, all helped?

Maybe you need a smooth bore with sloppy tolerances. Or keep the rifling but hone the barrel out a couple thousandths. If it doesn't affect aim too badly. You could also fine tune things with twice the granularity by firing one gun at a stationary target, e.g. a lead musket ball, to determine the exact relative velocity you need, and then experiment with powder loads and bores to get 1/2 of that.   I'm not sure if you can do much about the materials, I mean lead is lead, unless the Civil war soldiers were alloying it with something else, but lead is the cheapest of pretty much anything, wouldn't make sense.",2년 전,3,

@floridagunrat1625,"In my experience I'd say in order to make the bullets fuse you are on the right track with velocity and lead alloy. Minie bullets are dead soft pure lead. The lead used to make modern pistol bullets is typically alloyed with antimony and tin for increased hardness, which also results in a more brittle bullet. This will result in more spelling effect and less potential for an actual Fusion of the two pieces of metal. Additionally, minie bullets are larger therefor having more lead that could be sacrificed on impact through initial spalling as the energy and velocity is depleted to a level that would result in the final fusing of the two projectiles.

@isettech,"Noticed your variation in time to ignition.  To get more precise ignition time, reduce your heating time. This time can vary based on the thermal load of the mass of powder touching the element. To reduce the delay caused by thermal mass, use a high voltage capacitor discharge system in your ignition. This causes the heater to rapidly overheat, and the high current causes the coil to move, effectively exploding the heater and throwing molten metal through your main powder charge, and the heater breaking, will cause a high energy arc adding additional high energy to the now short ignition dwell time. I could assist with how to do Capacitor discharge ignition.  Wish I knew you were going to do this, so I could review and collaborate.  The high energy discharge greatly reduces the chance of a misfire, as the ignition energy is quite high and difficult to quench with thermal loading. It is more dangerous for electrical safety due to the amount of energy stored, but when the capacitors are discharged with a bleed resistor, the circuitry is safe to handle.  This would need a charge time in your pre igntion sequence to charge the capacitors.  Photoflash capacitors are recommended for this project. A 50 to 500 Joule discharge in a few parts of a nanosecond ensures a quick ignition.  There will never be a few miliseconds in the ignition sequence to cause discharge delays in the projectiles.",2년 전,0,

Your specialised knowledge has nothing to do with the gun “issue”, so you have no standing to appeal to authority on this issue. It used to shock me how high IQ people as likely your self could have such bad takes, but now I understand just how much a social bubble insulates people like you. It takes a disagreeable personality to question the established hegemony. My experience is, people like you who are highly educated tend to be more agreeable, and hence a heterodox opinion from their social circle or the political establishment for that matter has the proclivity to be scarce. People make the decision to violate others rights, inanimate objects don’t. Violating other’s property rights and right to pursuit eudaemonia won’t change the fact that a person decided to make the illiberal choice to violate another’s rights.

You might need a higher speed camera around the 250K-300K frames/sec range though since the 4 Bore muzzle velocity is 200-400 ft/sec fast than the .45LC.,2년 전,1,

Awsome job everyone 👏  Just thought food .. do you think it could have to do not only with the adhesion ability of the copper jacket ..but the impact with each other and the fact lead always has a oxide layer .. could it ignite (like a fire piston ) and tact weld the two together? Then pair in the fact lead is more maluable and ...stickier?.. than copper also copper has a higher conductivity than lead so lead will generate much more heat in theory from compression..further softening it..and lastly mini balls were hollow partly to allow the projectile to swathe itself easier to the rifling .. so instead of a neutons cradle you have more of a ""rug beaten on a clothes line "" affect acting like two cast nets.

Too much antimony in the bullet composition (antimony hardens the bullet) 2. Weapons too close to each other for apples to apples comparison.  The bullet sandwich in the museum is comprised of two large, soft rounds which met at Civil War-era velocities.  IANA antique ballistics expert but based on a little muzzleloader experience, even modern .50 caliber rounds rarely exceed 700 fps.  Depending on how far apart the two soldiers were, the bullets might have been traveling at closer to ~200-500 fps. One final crazy thought I had is that maybe the bullet sandwich in the museum was found embedded in an object which would explain why they're so little spalling, leaving the bullets mostly complete.

@zachr21897,"So a few major contributors to why you aren't getting fusion are probably down to the bullets you were using. Firstly, while yes the .45 is a very big bullet it's not near the size of the old minie balls used back in that day, both sides used a wide array of weapons but the two most common were a .58 caliper and a .69 caliper. Both are much larger traveling a little slower with over double the mass of the modern. That paired with this second factor is probably why you can't get the results you want, that second and arguably most important factor is modern ammo uses much harder lead alloys vs the very soft lead used back then. Oftentimes pure lead was used which mixed with the size and speed of the rounds probably allowed them to fuse. Your best bet would probably be to cast your own minie ball type bullets out of as pure of lead as you can, you probably could have a set of black powder barrels machined instead of using cartridges just using black powder charges and for the lead I would suggest casting them out of lead sinkers as they are probably the closest to the soft lead used in the civil war. Remember, the minie ball was designed to expand a good amount under firing pressures to engage the rifling while still being easy to load so it was a very soft lead, cast your bullets out of lead sinkers and I'm willing to bet they'll stick.

@OwenWalker,"Before getting further than 3:20 .. as we're ""thinking about this together"" I wanted to write down my initial thoughts  Safety: - Both guns behind two metal plates. Metal plates have a cutout for the gun to fire through with a second plate slightly oversized to the cutout on the barrel side of the plate to cover the opening.  Second plate is hinged from the bottom with a latch above to be able to lock the plate in place before ready to fire. Triggers: - A Mount system with solenoids rigged against the triggers to be actuated by digital signal. Timing: - Sample size of time from trigger to barrel exit and round speed from 20 rounds (from the same box) fired from each gun, check for any major outliers and average it out. If any major outliers....... (to be filled later ;D) Destruction: - Same as safety system but keep the cutout circular and only slightly larger than the size of the gun barrel so in the event of misfire its more likely to hit the sacrificial plate vs the gun behind it.  4:10 - in and loading rounds manually for better control over the gunpowder charge is great idea 7:45 - LOL - the blastshields are awesome - even if could get similar results with a simpler setup. 9:35 - Scratch that - being able to remotely ""re-safety"" the system in event of misfire is the exact reason you'd want to be able to remotely the disengage and re-engage of the safety 13:56 - I would assume a copper bullet or such is going to be needed for them to fuse together. The FMJs seem to be too soft to be able absorb the energy from impact without destruction 32:15 - I'm curious how much having a second material inbetween also assisted with the fusion of the rounds. Multiple different possibilities I could see in my head... oxygenated outer shell of the lead being pulled away, having a dissimular metal inbetween.. reduiced impact energy.. etc.. etc..

@58allendavis,"The bullets you bought no doubt contain small amounts of tin and antimony. Tin is added to lead in order to harden it, but tin and lead don't want to stick together all that well. Reloaders learned ages ago, maybe as early as the mid-nineteenth century that antimony can be used as a binding agent. Those old Civil War bullets consisted almost entirely of pure lead. I'd bet a dollar against a carrot that you'd get your bullets to fuse if you used pure lead bullets -- or at least bullets with as little hardening or binding agents as possible.  Other comments about rotational differences aren't a factor (I don't believe). Nor would the direction of the rotational spin. I've been reloading since 1971 when I was just shy of 13 years old. My very first thought was that your problem in not achieving any fusing of the bullets was the material. Tin and antimony were added as hardening agents to allow lead bullets to be fired at much higher velocities without having an excessive amount of lead fouling to be left behind and stuck to the interior of the barrel. This wrecks accuracy. That's why for years, reloaders would love to use old wheelweights or even linotype alloy for casting bullets. Even with hardened lead bullets, you can only get so much velocity before you reach a point of diminishing returns, hence the invention of cupro-nickel jacketing material for bullets.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

Given that reducing gunpowder doesn't yield the desired outcome, how about we reconsider the environment in which the bullets travel? Instead of air, what if we introduce a denser gas as the medium?  My theory is that the bullets will decelerate much more quickly in a denser gas, potentially leading to a more controlled impact and increasing the chances of fusion rather than fragmentation. Perhaps we could house both barrels in a container filled with this denser gas - a material like plexiglass could work as the container.  It's a wild idea, but might just do the trick.

The Civil War rifles shot those large caliber bullets, .58 and .64 being common, so you had a lot of mass, fairly slow moving with nearly pure lead. You're very close in velocity, stepping up to the heaviest grain .44 would probably help a little, using pure lead is the important key. Today's manufactured bullets are alloys to increase bullet hardness, creating less lead fouling in the barrel. You are so very close to getting the fusion. The velocity at impact is probably lower than what you can achieve with the barrels so close to each other. Bullets lose speed rapidly, at 7 feet you wouldn't much drop, at 10yds, it's surprising.

It should be easy enough to find someone who has several 1860's era bullets and do non-destructive tests on those to determine the lead alloy mix of that era bullet.   Second test which alloy mix has the lowest melting point I think that's the key.   Also I think a 410 shotgun shell loaded with rifled slugs would be closer to the size, weight and configuration of a Civil War Minie' ball than the solid 44's you are using. Remington makes a 410 rifled slug,  because of COVID there maybe out of stock.. My point is a rifled slug is more like a Minié ball than what you are presently using. In addition 1000 ft/sec was the average speed of a Civil War Minie' ball. With your high speed cameras the speed of the projectile you are firing can be easily measured.",2년 전(수정됨),1,

@B_izzyy,"I'm no physicist but, In order for them to fuse it would be under the idea of friction welding. The main idea is high twist rate plus high compressive load. In order to achieve this you'd need a higher twist rate barrel with a larger powdered casing. The larger powder load would be simulating the higher compressive force as you're colliding two entities with separate Ke (or perhaps a larger caliber as well), rather than a moving force colliding against a static object. Lead solder welds around 300-350 centigrade, generating that temperature for a small amount of time would theoretically fuse whatever 2 pieces of lead that could transfer the Ke to that level of thermal energy.

@tomserb9752,"In 1862 (the museum shot) both sides were using mostly musket rifles.  The fact that they used a percussion cap meant some of the gas from the powder bled off, reducing the speed - and the calibers were larger, .577 and .58.  So it's heavier bullets moving slower, and the distance each traveled before impact was probably around 200', further reducing velocity by air resistance.  Increasing the distance between the barrels is impractical for an experiment... I wonder if there's a safe way to redirect some portion of the gas to mimic the likely velocities?",2년 전,0,

@flamerollerx01,"I think the problem is two fold. One, the material the bullets are made out of isn't working out and the other reason is probably because you're firing too close together and need more distance so the bullets can slow down enough and have less force. You can't use less powder, or less explosive powder, because then the bullets won't leave the chambers and you need the bullets to engage the rifling at the moment of ignition, which I believe means the only solution is to lower the force transferred into the bullets on impact by increasing distance.  Of course distance will add another factor to solve for, that being air pressure (wind). You'll definitely get more misses with more distance. One final possibility would be to use shorter barrels. I suspect that will leave the problem of too much force keeping the bullets from fusing.",2년 전,0,

@amzarnacht6710,"When you were talking about the bullets fusing... if I remember from my days doing civil war re-enactments, a bullet from a 3 or 5 band musket weighed at least half an oz or even an oz (or MORE!) of pure unalloyed lead.  It also had a heck of a lot smaller load of slower burning black powder rather than modern smokeless.  The bullets from the long colt are far too small and going way too fast to 'fuse' - as seen, they simply obliterate each other.  Considering their mass you'd have to put just a pinch of powder behind them to slow them down enough for the lead to deform at the point of impact but NOT liquefy.  Also, those fused bullets did NOT strike square on nose to nose.  In that instance the rear of the bullet imparts forward energy that rebounds from the point of impact, causing the remains at the center to recoil.  Where larger bullets are fired slowly and strike ever so slightly off center the rear of the bullet sheers to the side which lessens the rebound force caused by the trailing material. This is perfectly illustrated @32:26 - the wallet prevented the trailing material from transferring its inertia into a rebound, it was captured by the material of the wallet before it could rebound.  And copper jacketed modern rounds simply won't do it - too slow and the copper will prevent the lead from interacting and any faster than 'too slow' they'll either fly apart or bounce off of each other.",2년 전(수정됨),1,

@seanmtactical6069,"Shooters found over time that pure lead bullets were inaccurate and caused a lot of barrel leading when shooting them where they directly touch the rifling.  So they would harden the bullets by adding tin and antimony.  Most use something close to or exactly a mixture called Linotype.  It's 84% lead, 12% antimony, and 4% tin.  It makes the bullet much more stronger and stops the leading problem.  But...  it also makes the lead flow differently during elastic and a partially in an inelastic collision.  It fragments and flows differently.  That's why you are seeing a 'shattering' of the bullets more.  You need to try pure lead bullets and preferably ones with a lube ring on them with lube in it to help prevent leading up the barrel.  You will also need to inspect the barrels every 10 rounds or so for lead build up in the rifling.  Second.  If you are using black powder, you can throw the charge of powder and then backfill the case with dry ground corn cob on the powder and then seat the bullet on top of it.  It may help with the inconsistency and allow you to get to a lower charge without having the primer flash over the small powder charge.  Good luck, and I await part two.",2년 전,0,

Older bullets, even back in the old west era of things, were made from softer lead than modern bullets, at least on average, and black powder firearms used the same if not even softer lead. Then there's the velocity of the modern powder and rounds, block powder produces lower pressure and thus slower velocities than modern counterparts. Combine the two differences and it felt obvious why they were exploding instead of fusing together like the Minié balls could, at slower velocities and with softer lead. You thankfully came to a similar conclusion, but figured I'd share my thoughts from a different perspective arriving at the same conclusion.

@johnstewart2011,"To pick a couple of nits, the “bullet” is the projectile that leaves the gun when it’s fired. “Cartridges” that consist of bullet, case, powder, and primer, are what are loaded in the gun prior to firing. It’s true that a bullet is loaded into the gun, but without the other components of the cartridge, it would never go anywhere. And the other one is that the formal name of the cartridge you were using is just 45 Colt; the “Long” part is mistakenly added by many shooters, but it is not part of the formal nomenclature.   It’s also not the least surprising that your bullets disintegrated when they hit each other in flight. Even lead 22 Long Rifle bullets fired from handguns will typically disintegrate when striking hard materials like steel. As you surmised, the Civil War bullets must have been traveling very slowly when they met to have not disintegrated as well rather than fusing together. I believe you’re also correct that the type of bullet metal may have affected how well they would fuse. Unjacketed bullets of the type you were using are typically made of a lead alloy that contains some hardening metal such as antimony to help prevent leaving lead residue in the gun barrel. That may make them more brittle and less likely to fuse together.    And although I can’t be certain, I believe the one piece you recovered that had copper (gilding metal) on both sides was from the base of the one jacketed bullet. When shooting such bullets at steel targets, it’s very common to find fragments like that on the ground in the area.",2년 전,0,

The two balls fused together looked like they were one large piece with no splits around the edge rather than all the shreds that came off your bullets when they collided. Almost like something forced them apart from the inside out. That could also explain why the two copper tips could fuse together, but only a small bit of the lead stayed with it.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@neon-john,"GREAT project!  Some tips from a lifelong marksman.  * shoot pure lead full wad-cutting bullets. * Don't leave light power charges laying around in the case.  It can undergo DTD (deflagration transition to detonation).  Single base powder is nitrocellulose.  Double-base powder is nitrocellulose with nitroglycerine.  Both are high explosives.  Powder BURNS in a gun.  If it transitions to detonation, it will open up the chamber just as if cut by a knife.  This happens with very light loads.  The solution is a buffer that is made to hold the powder against the primer.  This is usually polyester cotton that is pressed tightly against the powder by seating the bullet.  In the 70s out wives got together and bought Dad, my brother each  a series 70 Colt 1911 Gold Cup.  We all stepped out into the driveway to fire a few rounds.  We were using my medium power semi-wad-cutter hand loads.  They had just enough powder to reliably cycle the action.  I shot first, a three round group.  All through 1 hole in a piece of slate.  I dug them out of the dirt and two were welded together.  Dad went next.  A master marksman who lost the National Matches inter-service marksman competition by one point in 1942, he  took his shots.  Again through the same hole.  I dug them out and found all three welded together.  I still have those.  So welding bullets together with modern ammo is possible.  Everything has to be juuust right and the bullets should be soft 100% lead.",2년 전,0,

@chases.7252,"This is probably going to get lost in a sea of comments, but I believe the reason you were struggling to get the modern bullets to fuse like you want is because modern lead bullets are hardened/annealed better. If you had cast your own bullets using a mold you likely would've seen better results but the store bought bullets you were using were probably much harder than the correct Civil War era Ball munitions. The reason you see them fusing after hitting the aluminum wallet is the impact with the aluminum caused the bullet that hit first to get hot enough to be more malleable. As it came into contact with the second bullet, this hotter and softer bullet molded to the still cooler and hard one. Your fragmentation in the video shows that the majority of the fragmentation came from the bullet that didn't hit the wallet first.   I personally believe that in order to get a good fusion on the bullets you have, you should figure out the annealing temperatures of lead and try to heat them, then cool them to make them as soft as possible, then when you fire them, fire them at very low speeds, similar to that of black powder cartridges, and not modern smokeless speeds. These two things should get you the fusion you are looking for on impact.   Whether you revisit this or not, it was an extremely interesting video. Thanks",2년 전,0,

Black powder of that time was way less powerful compared to today’s smokeless powder also being such a short distance on your masterfully crafted test rig the velocity is a big difference. The bullets were just good old lead like today’s non jacketed target ammo but you are using .45 caliber, most civil war caliber ranged from .57-.70 so much larger surface area for contact. Finally bullet design, many civil war bullets had a deep cup in the back side to both hold powder but also expand to seal tight to the rifle barrel preventing tumbling along with lose of pressure. I see a lot of work went into setting this up but for success I recommend using 12ga 1oz slugs in a smooth bore at low speed.

@hsm4983,"Hey Destin, I'm sorry if this reads like a gotcha comment. This is clearly a triumphant moment in your career as an engineer, science educator, and curious person. But since you invited your audience to have a conversation about safety, I'd rly value hearing your thoughts on the implications of scattering so much lead across an unassuming, safe looking, pristine environment.   I know the US has a proud history of gun use. I know lead represents a cheap, dense metal that makes for great bullets. And I know recreating flukes from the civil war means using the same materials as the civil war.   But lead is dense metal because it's a literally a ""heavy metal"". It's severely poisonous. Frankly, exposure to lead will do the opposite of making someone smarter every day. It's brain poison.   And unlike a lot of metals, it's non-ferrous, so it's not as easy as just waving a magnet over the ground and collecting the old shards. That lead is now a part of the soil.   I get that I'm overstepping a bunch of cultural implications that come from firing guns in the US, especially for someone trained as a projectiles expert. I'm sure this probably isn't a normal way you think about your results. But dude, it's hard for me to watch a science educator spread lead in a place it looks like kids could roll around someday.   Even if it doesn't seem like kids could play in this space now. That lead is just going to sit there invisible and soon forgotten, and no one knows what the future holds.  So would you be against scientifically reflecting on lead toxicity as a safety risk? After all, maybe I'm being ignorant. Or maybe you'll learn something that shifts your safety protocols and models something new for gun owners or people who fish with lead weights. Either way, I'd value a thoughtful conversation to get smarter on the subject.",2년 전,0,

@LucasJackson_37,"Not necessarily true that ""muskets"" of the civil war were all rifled. While it was true primarily in the North that they used the 1841 rifled musket either a .58 or .69 caliber as standard issue. Due to the manufacturing advantages the North had. Even at that there was still smooth bore muskets used by the North until they were phased out as the war progressed. Approximately half the weapons issued by the South at the outbreak of the war was about 50/50 smooth to rifled issued to troops and didn't improve throughout the war. Instead with weapons imported from Europe during the war, they ended up with over 100 different rifles being issued to troops, up to and including the old British Brown Bess smoothbore and even flintlocks converted to fire Mini ball ammo.   All that TLDR said, I think it's possible he has a point. Assuming both bullets from the civil war are even the same caliber, the slow twists of the rifling of the time is not even close to the twists per inch of a modern pistol, if nothing else it was a much slower twist from a period muzzle loader. Then even though it's a Minie Ball it doesn't mean it wasn't fired from a smoothbore musket. There's documented battles during the war of troops out of ammo using cut nails and even rocks to fire at the enemy, so it's possible it was shot much the same way so long as it could be jammed down the barrel.   So I don't disagree that rotation could be part of the issue.    Another is, we're talking about on avg for the time a 500 grain Minie Ball, that's so much more mass than they used. Speed could be a factor, with documented bullets hitting the wool uni's they wore and falling to the ground. Testing from the period rifles showed that muzzle velocities as low as 200 fps are possible. The North even recognized that with velocities that low wouldn't punch through wool at distances of approx 100 yards. So they had a recommended powder load to achieve the desired effect. However a very common thing for solders under fire in the war was very light powder loads, a lot of time no powder loads at all. There were rifles found with over half a dozen Minie balls in the barrels with no powder.    Mass, rotation, speed a combination of the three could be at issue. But hey I can be completely wrong, and I'm ok with that. Sorry for the legnth and probably way to much content in this comment. 😅",2년 전(수정됨),4,

@dmichaelbruce2819,"Now admittedly, I am no engineer, but I can think of three variables that might impact your experiment.   1: Bullet Alloy... (You touched on this at the end of the video) Bullet alloys have changed a fair bit over the years and so it is possible, likely even, that the lead alloy used in the civil war is different than that lead alloy used today to make bullets.  For instance, a lot of bullets today are specifically designed to fragment on impact for safety reasons.  A softer alloy may be more prone to fusing instead of fragmenting, especially at lower velocities, which brings me to the second issue...  2: Gun Powder... (You also touched on this at the end of the video) Guns of Civil War era used Black Powder as a propellant, whereas guns today use Smokeless Powder... And black powder has a slower burn rate, thus lower pressures, than smokeless powder does... Resulting in lower bullet velocities.  3: Differences in Firearms... (This I didn't see you touch on.) Many of guns used in the Civil War were muzzle loaders, which likely also contributed to the bullets fusing instead of fragmenting... Breach loaded firearms were around then, but not so much in common use... And unless the firearm was a breach loader, it was likely that it had a Smooth Bore Barrel instead of a Rifled Bore... Which would Definitely have an impact on the outcome of the colliding projectiles.   I would also suggest looking at the design differences between muzzle loaded bullets and modern breach loaded bullets. And try to match things up, load for load, (ie; bullet weight, etc.) to the types of firearms used in the Civil War.   The only variable we don't know is how far apart the two men firing the guns were in the case of the museum piece... The distance of which would have slowed down both bullets to some unknown degree.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@bobjoatmon1993,"I wonder what is alloyed with the bullets your shooting based on the fragments. 1) The Civil War bullets were pretty much pure lead. 2) Most commercial casters use some tin and antimony in their alloy. The tin helps reduce surface tension and helps the lead fill out the mold. The antimony does not actually alloy, it forms crystals in a matrix of lead but acts to 'harden' the bullet so it doesn't leave deposits of lead on the bore of the barrel. BUT the harder bullet doesn't smear as much and tends to fragment when it hits a hard surface (and hitting an oncoming bullet counts as a hard surface) 3) Years ago I was dealing with refurbishing an old machine and it actually has the Molds for casting it's bearings. I first cast regular lead bearings and when I ran the unit the lead smeared into each other. What I found was originally they didn't have Babbitt alloy but did have DIFFERENT alloys in the two pieces so they didn't friction fuse. Recast one with 2% tin and the other with 4% they didn't fuse and worked And consider galling in aluminum or stainless, two pieces of the same alloy will gall easier so the engineers specify different alloys (or in aluminum have anodized parts, and use graphite or other 'never seize' compound for stainless)  So based on that experience,  I believe that you should make sure each of your bullets are pure lead to try that variable",2년 전,0,

@kennethg.727,"Other than the lead being cast differently back then; on a black powder rifle, would the lead ball become preheated to help with the fusion? Also, what type of rifling did they have back then, if any? Any excess gas and pressure would cause heat to the lead and the less of a spin on the bullet would change the way the bullet would break apart and may help with fusion.    I feel that it’s more likely that a bullet was fired and hit another bullet that was already fired and on the ground.

@TerminalM193,"Your instances where accuracy was an issue was probably due to the rifling becoming filled with led since you're using full on lead casings. This will foul a barrel and it's rifling MUCH quicker than using a copper jacket. After just a few rounds the rifling between the two barrels were no longer exacting by design. This immediately will start causing differences from one round to the next resulting to quite a few different variables from difference in velocity, accuracy and bullet stabilization. This normally doesn't start causing issues until around 25 - 50 yards but when you're looking for equal performance and results between the two firearms at the exact same time then this certainly becomes a contributing factor when looking for such exact results. I do a ton of different firearm competitions from idpa, 3 gun and bench shooting between tons of different calibers. When using calibers that primarily use full on led bullets you need to run a patch through the bore way more often compared to copper jacket bullets. I've actually seen significant increases in velocity from one round to the next at 7 yards when the bore & barrel start becoming more fouled.",2년 전,0,

If your barrels have identical rifling, then they will impart opposite rotations when they're facing each other. This will mean the bullets are spinning opposite directions and feeling unnecessary shear force at the point where they meet. You need to replace one of the barrels with one that has rifling curved the other way. That will make sure the bullets are rotating in tandem when they meet instead of rotating in opposition.

I have no doubt that the Minie bullets that fused, were fired probably well over several hundred feet apart, therefore, most of their energy was lost, by the time that they met. 2) As you mentioned, the lead composition is completely different, and there isn't as much of it, since you're using a .45 Long Colt. You need to use something like a shotgun Sabot slug or similar. You could even use black powder rifles with a .50 caliber Sabot to more closely mimic the Minie ball and the ammunition of the era.

The North had mostly rifled barrels.  Both used Percussion caps, which weren't always made exact, powder was not the modern smokeless we use today and had inconsistent burns.

I am not a scientist nor any kind of specialist, in fact my only superpower is that I'm just off (below) the scale of Autistic.  But looking at your footage I surmised that the lead compound composition is either too pure or not dense enough to allow the fusions.   When the aluminum wallet aided in the fusion I went nuts.  Please continue to push this and make cool videos.  And please let me know if your continuations include looking at older compound variations of lead as my hypothesis is older lead when smelted in the past held greater amounts of impurities which in turn may have allowed the heat generated to do more to fuse (along with creating less shearing and separation of the lead under such force).  Additionally looking at the aluminum wallet footage there is a heat signatue glow where the collision is (at least I thought so).  Again thanks for another great video.",2년 전,0,

@gnarthdarkanen7464,"I've seen those bullets fused together, too... I've wondered what would have to happen for that to occur. NOW, thanks to you, Destin, I'm wondering if it didn't ACTUALLY happen in someone's arm or leg... with just enough flesh or maybe hitting in a saddlebag or backpack... a pouch or canteen or even a waterskin... JUST enough substance to contain the lead so it didn't fragment.      I DO KNOW that bullets were ""very slow"" back in the day. They were even slow enough that the advantages of rifling were debatable... which is saying quite a lot if you think about that. It's not that there wasn't a significant upgrade, but that upgrade in shooting for precision and accuracy was PLAUSIBLE to argue about. That means there had to be marksmen who knew their smoothbores well enough to consider the advantages at least somewhat dubious... figuring they could compensate with purely skill.       We DO know better now, but we also have smokeless powder and derivatives of nitrocellulose that burn more reliably giving a consistent supersonic speed. That's a HUGE step in technology when it comes to basic projectile weaponry. AND the difference between a bullet penetrating water and exploding within a few inches of the surface is whether or not it's a supersonic round...       ANYWAYS... My point here is simply this. JUST IN CASE, you try the slower and slower rounds and continue to see them ricochet or fragment rather than fuse together... Try some different targets of varied thickness and material, ESPECIALLY ballistic gel. Not only is the stuff FUN to play with, it CAN be a decent analogue for penetrating flesh in case the originals WERE cut out of a soldier... AND it's the same gelatin that they make gummy bears out of!!!!         ALL the more excusable to use the ""extra gel"" to make Ballistic Gummy Bears!!!   hahahahaha...   ;o)",2년 전,0,

The slower speeds could have given the lead more opportunity to deform and mold together, and the extra mass would have helped keep them from starting to bounce off each other.",2년 전,0,

Seems like you might have a better chance of fusing the bullets if the guns rifling were spinning in the same direction on impact. In other words, One gun left hand rifling and the other gun right hand rifling. Also, perhaps you may need more mass in the bullet to absorb momentum. If you could get a civil war era miniball and modern lead and have both tested by a metallurgist that you be interesting too.",2년 전,9,

@SimanSlivar,To make them fuse are going to need to use lead no jacket and turn your velocity way down. You have to remember the men firing this would have been 100 to 300 yards apart. The velocity is way to high at how close the guns are. But this is really fing cool. They would have been firing black powder rounds aswell.   If you use black powder you can use cotton filling to take up the space in the cartridge and turn down the velocity till they fuse.,2년 전(수정됨),0,

@DoubleCrossfire,"I really enjoyed watching the physics of what's happening between the bullets upon impact. One suggestion, if you want to get the bullets to fuse mid air, you could try shooting into a small block of ballistics gel.  This would help contain the fragments, and also slow down the bullets enough that their speed wasn't obliterating them upon impact. Could also produce a really cool effect within the ballistics gel!  i know this could be seen as cheating, though in fairness, you don't know if both those bullets from the original also were slowed by something either.  Also your suggestion on the wrong lead could also be a factor.  Either way this video was amazing to watch, and that shot with the impact stopping nearly all motion was awesome!

@Dixon_1974,"First, let me say impressive work. The safety precautions you guys put in place demonstrates not only your all’s professionalism and experience but also y’alls foresight. The ingenuity used vaguely reminds me of the portal 1 and 2 video games.  I have a suggestion. Now correct me if I am wrong here, but rifles during the civil war did not have rifling (or at least any rifling that was effective). So 1) remove rifling to decrease speed muzzle velocity. 2) Use higher grain bullets to not only add more material to fuse but to also decrease kinetic energy. And 3) maybe replicate the projectiles of that time: gun powder behind paper with a bullet, compacted.  Lastly, how about we try different types of bullets? Lead bullets were used in the video, but like hollow point to hollow point, would that cause a HEAT explosion? What about AP to AP? Or even better AP to Hollow point?

@_Bumby_,"Just a hypothesis, but surely the shape of the bullet is also a factor in making them fuse? The Civil War used minie balls. Which, depending on the manufacture, tend to be more pointed with a smaller front end diameter than a modern .45 long. Having less surface area on the initial impact may increase the time before the bullets fully collide.   Basically the initial impact would cancel out most of the force between the bullets, slowing them down and letting them more easily fuse on complete impact. This may be somewhat confirmed by what we saw with the wallet fusion at the end, the bullets were slowed to a point where they still had enough force to fuse, but not break apart.  I hope that makes sense, think about the collision at 22:00 but if the bullets were moving at a slower rate after the initial impact which could allow them more time to fuse. It’s all just a theory though, watching this video and trying to dissect the physics of it is really making me realize how absurd the original Civil War fuse is!",2년 전,1,

For the issue of the nut on the north gun turning when firing I wonder if having the threads go the opposite way might help as firing will cause the nut to tighten instead of loosen which might improve consistency. Second, you could make an adapter sheath to go between the long cartridge and the short one, then have 2 different end caps for the breaches to fit those two. This way you can have the more consistent burn of the short cartridge with the engaging of the rifling of the long cartridge. Or just chop the chamber down to fit the small cartridge.

@gregstevens7053,"Destin- I'm wondering if purity and accuracy play a part in it also.  If you think about it, back in the time of the Civil War we did not have the manufacturing , conditions we have now,  meaning and especially the technical accuracy.  What I mean by purity is when they manufactured their gun powder, the purity of the mixture could affect the burn rate and explosive power of it.  Our gunpowder today is made to such tight specifications, but that didn't exist back then.  And with a less pure mixture, the velocity provided would be decreased causing a slower impact.  Also with purity, the bullet material then may not have been as pure as today's.  They might have used any materials laying around to melt down and make their bullets, which could drastically affect the properties of the metal upon impact.  Every thing we manufacture today has such tight tolerances and specifications that didn't exist in that period,   And back to the gunpowder, the Civil War guns were loaded by hand with powder, it was up to the operator to measure out the correct amount.  And when you're under fire and just trying to get a  shot off, your odds of getting the correct amount in is greatly affected.  So when you look at all the variables (purity of powder, amount of powder and purity of bullet material) you have a lot to deal with.",2년 전,0,

Civil War era black powder will burn slower than modern gunpowder, which might be a factor unless that is what you were using in your reloads.  You used 45 caliber bullets, and the museum piece might have been 58 or even 69 caliber.  Big & slow is different from smaller & faster.  Barrel length might affect completeness of burn.  Twist rate of the rifling may very well have been slower, or even non existent in the case of smooth bore muskets.  Now you might need some twist for stabilization and repeatability, but the spin is going to affect the stick, as at the moment of impact both bullets are doing an opposite spin.

My idea is that the merged bullets in the museum is likely two shots that collided with each one consisting of differing metal composition. One is denser and allowed the other to deform into it.

They do not shatter like a solid bullet, but fold or collapse.  It is likely the two fused bullets at the Museum contacted each other after flying some distance.  I would try using Foster slugs from a shotgun barrels with reduced powder charges or air released.   The twist rates for Civil War rifled muskets were very slow in the order of 1 in 60 to 1 in 72 inches.  Some were left hand twist and some right hand twist, so it is possible that two bullets could strike each other rotating the same direction and reduce the shattering aspect.  There are several examples of fused soft lead bullets around from the Civil War and the Revolutionary War.",2년 전,0,

If you look at the pictures of the ones from the civil war they are almost a perfect mushroom. Similar to what you would see if you heated up lead it would expand pretty evenly.

Civil War era cast bullets would have been basically pure lead, and the muzzle velocities of field loaded rifles would have likely been sub 1kFT/Sec, with significant drops in velocity after 100 yards.

The second thing is same reason incase of a spark firing off the round prematurely if both were down you don't have any doubt where the stray bullet will go so being to the opposite side to insert the positive would be 99% safer (imo) ...Again its only a smol smol saftey thing but yeah that would be my only noticeable safety addition  On the note of grain of the bullet.

@thebarkingmouse,To help with powder consistency in a long cartridge my grandfather wood load a cotton pill cut from thick felt between the back of the bullet and the powder. This would keep the powder compacted next to the primer. It's anecdotal. I'm going to do a search right now to see if anybody else is doing that today. But I think of it like a power piston from a shotgun. He keeps the gunpowder together helps it burn clean the only side effect that you get a little burst of cotton out of the gun. But it might keep your Barrel little bit clean. As long as the pills are cut from the same piece of felt comedy should be about the same density and react pretty much the same pushing the bullet.,2년 전,0,

@1234567890CAB,"The spacing from the bullet to the rifling is an important measurement in ballistics and is why headspacing is so important for accuracy.  You could also try solid copper bullets. When casting solid lead bullets, the hardness of the lead is important and can be manipulated by using different lead alloys.  The hardness of the lead in jacketed bullets is not as important because the jacket keeps it all together and prevents the lead from contacting the barrel. In jacketed bullets the lead is often much softer.  When the bullet is just lead, the lead needs to be harder to reduce fouling, or excessive amounts of lead rubbed off in the rifling. When under loading or using light loads, often called cowboy loads because of the use in revolver trick shots, a packing material can be used in the case to hold all of the powder to the rear.  That could be paper wadding, sand, flour, talcum powder, bread, or any number of relatively inert materials.  However, when you use a packing material, you're decreasing the volume and some of the packing material will ablate, so you'll get a bit higher velocity with the same powder load.  Finally, handgun and shotgun powder burns quickly to utilize the shorter barrel, but you're working towards maximum control, not maximum velocity, therefore a slower more steady burning rifle powder might produce better more consistent results.",2년 전,1,

I don't know if this kind of concern has factored in into your meticulous planning and performance and i don't know how much a lifetime within the milinducomplex, or at least close proximity to that, changes ones sense of scale on these aspects. these lands are alive, however, and they don't really have to have additional warfare brought upon them, do they?  i know this most definitely is but a drop in a bucket within an ocean of military interactions past and present. i am painfully aware of the climate impact the gigantic number of machines of war have, whether intentional or simply out of neglect and irrelevancy when the main 'objective' is defending or offending oneanother. just next week there's gonna be yet another large scale maneuvering exercise happening over here with massive numbers of planes and such.  look, i really have no intention to lessen your accomplishments here, but i can't help but wonder how the place remembers this short interlude of curiosity playing out among its members, green and otherwise...  peace.",2년 전,0,

It should be logarithmic for the velocity out the barrel with the psi increase...if you can keep the temp of the air the same going into the barrel chamber.   As for the bullet material, that could be easily,but also hard to solve...Go to some civil war sites and find some of the bullets and have the bullet analyzed on the material/alloy used in them.

@NBFman1991,"I've seen a number of comments on reversing the rifling of one of the barrels to get the bullets spinning on the same direction. This alone, may solve your problem, but, as a chemist, my initial thought was to look at the composition of your bullet.  If the ""lead"" is not pure lead, but instead has lead oxide or other compounds mixed in, they may be hindering the fusion upon collision. Lead naturally forms a patina of PbO, which can further react and form PbCO3 and PbSO4, and any of these will make it more difficult for the bullets to combine. If pure lead is in contact with pure lead, you should end up with a much easier fusion of the bullets.  I would suggest trying to get some lead that has a verified purity and casting your own bullets. Also, giving the bullets a quick sanding/polish before loading could also help get any oxides formed on the surface off.  Love your videos, Destin. Looking forward to the second part of this one!",2년 전,0,

@jongrossardt7542,"As mentioned below, use pure lead bullets. Secondly, you really don't know the terminal velocity of the original bullets just before impact. It could have been a mere few FPS. I'd suggest a couple of design changes. Use a pneumatic process as opposed to gunpowder to fire the bullets. In that manner you can more accurately regulate the ""chamber"" pressure. If using a pneumatic device you could dial down the chamber pressure to get whatever velocity you want. Maybe even use a pneumatic piston. Secondly, if the rifling engagement is a potential issue (as far as being able to get the bullet out of the barrel) switch to a smooth bore and use a card wad behind the bullet. With no rifling to engage that variable is removed from the process. A slightly undersized bullet to the bore diameter would also allow lower velocities to be achieved.",2년 전,0,

@darkknightnine,"I'm sure someone has mentioned it by now but I'm feelin nerdy so here goes: If you are using smokeless powder and a different rifling twist rate you may not be able to achieve conditions close enough to fuse two lead bullets together like the 2 minie balls at the museum. Smokeless using the pressure from a building gas pressure from burning of powder. Blackpowder not so much. Are your rifling twist rates at all close to civil wartime rifling? Did the museums display say anything about distance? If two bullets were fired at each other from across a long field bullet drop might also influence angles. Also, your leads purity could be causing extremely small variations. During the casting process today, any two bullets you make are very close in composition. In the 1860's you not only have impurities from the periods casting process, but you have 2 different casting impurity chances from two different factories even if the procedures were similar. Purity might be questioned if one side couldn't use all lead because of a shortage. :)  -Kirk (former UAH grad student)",2년 전,0,

@kamikaze00007,"This is amazing. My theory about the fusing is probably due to the speed of both projectiles as well as the bullets having a different shape than the Minié ball of the Civil War era. Since the Minie is hollow like a cup, the force of impact compresses the center mass of the bullets ""into"" the hollowed out sides of the cupped section. With the speed and heat, the metal being compressed into itself is probably heated high enough to fuse it into one solid mass before it can basically flower out completely into bits. Since the bullets you guys used were ""whole"" bullets, the impact force on contact pushed all that lead at the core but had no ""hollow place"" to go into, and so the entire center mass compresses at the middle while expanding radially outward like a flower and all that excess material essentially ""pushes out"" the rest of the side material until it splits apart into bits.  It's kind of hard to explain, but imagine two plastic cups. One has been frozen with water inside it, making it a solid block (the bullet you guys used), and the other is an empty cup (the Minie ball bullet). If you put both cups upside-down, and then smash both of them at the cups' bottoms with a hammer or maul, the ice-filled cup will probably shatter while the empty cup will get crunched up or flower open in almost one piece.",2년 전,0,

Compare that to what the civil war weapons were producing.  You may not be able to test the fused together balls in the museum (but hey, cant hurt to ask for a specimen to test), they may even know the metallurgy or want the data.  A closer examination of the fused balls could also reveal if they were spinning, they may have been fired from a smoothbore.  If you had the right alloy, and get another hit like the one that stopped dead in the camera, with no spin, I bet they would fuse.

You could use a lighter load to help slow down the bullets even more with shorter barrels.

@stevenm6065,Destin as somewhat of a gun nut if you haven't figured this out yet might I make a suggestion I think the issue you might be having with getting the bullets to fuse is that the lead you're using is to hard making it brittle and making it shatter on impact try using a softer type of lead something else you may try and some may consider it cheating but if you can somehow temper the tip of the bullet making it harder but leave the rear as a softer lead it may slow the bullets down on impact enough for the softer rear end of the bullets to fuse just a thought.

@DDogsthe3rd,"Amazing video! My theory of why the civil war bullet stuck together is that the velocity would've been much slower than you could acheive here purely because of the distance from each barrel. I think the bullets from the civil war collision probably had tens or even hundreds of meters to slow down in the air before colliding, and so combined with the older equipment, there was less impact velocity than the one's we saw here. This is some of the most amazing slow-mo footage i've ever seen though.",2년 전,0,

@Kevin-ht1ox,I cannot imagine Civil War lead would be particularly pure.  There could be traces of precious metals (gold/silver) or zinc (maybe iron but probably not) -- also sulfur.  I think the slower speed bullet is probably likely and then a lead alloy that either increases or reduces the melting temperature.  I would start with a formula that reduces the melting temperature.,2년 전,0,

This would have an effect on exit velocity as well as accuracy. The second is somewhat related. Were the civil war rifles which fired the fused bullets loaded with black powder or smokeless powder (smokeless powder was starting to be used around this time, but Im not sure in this case)? Black powder has different burn characteristics than smokeless which might affect the final outcome.",2년 전,0,

@Wizzanker,"Just some wisdom I have picked up being a competition shooter for years...  I was always told that you get the most consistent velocities when your case is 80% full of powder.  It needs some air room to expand into during initial ignition.  Full cases generally have less consistent velocity, so you may have had the opposite of the intended effect going with the smaller case.  You also want to keep it above 50% capacity or the primer might flash across the top of the powder instead of the back.    The rifle jump theory is probably part of it too.",2년 전,0,
@nathanmistler1186,"During your discussion about misses I believe the following might help provide some insights:  I know in rifles, when reloading and testing accuracy there are things to consider such as ""barrel harmonics"" and ""barrel whip"". Since no 2 barrels can be the exact same, each reacts differently to different power charges. Not sure how much that affects these short barrels you used. However on 20"" barrels it is pretty easy to see on high speed cameras. The barrel will literally whip/bend during the shot.  Second thing in regards to testing accuracy is bullet selection as the tail end of the bullet can change how the gases affect the bullet once it leaves the barrel and gets engulfed by the exiting gases behind it. Again you can see this on high speed cameras. Thus why boat tail bullets tend to have better down range accuracy. Again not sure how much that would affect you as the distance is pretty short.  The other thing is, jumping the ""lands"" is most definitely going to cause accuracy problems. However in rifles there are varying degrees at which it affects it. I've had some rifles that want a .02"" jump and some that want to be jammed into the ""lands"". I've also had some guns not care about jumping the ""lands"" too. Just comes back to barrel harmonics.  Other side note:  Consistency between bullets and cases also matters. I bought mass produced ammo and reloaded myself, and have found that consistency between rounds does vary. I've had it where in a pack of 50 bullets I've had a 5 gr difference between the lightest and heaviest bullet. Same for powder. Not every time do you get a consistent charge.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@BenAtTheTube,"1. To fuse the bullets, you need big heavy slow moving bullets. 2. There is no need to power the bullets by gun powder. They make perfectly fine large bore air rifles. 3. There is no need to have both bullets moving. The same collision can be obtained by having one of the bullets suspended on a soda straw or a string. 4. Start by shooting at a steel back stop. If the bullet shatters there, it will not fuse to another bullet. You need something that will smush against the back stop with minimum loss to shattered pieces. This means, of course, soft material at slow velocity. 5. Copper jacket bullets cannot fuse, the copper material is too hard. Definitely only soft lead. And they can be round balls, although your museum Minie bullets are cylindrical. 6. OK, I understand, you really want to have two moving bullets driven by gunpowder. Once you get the collision parameters worked out doing things the easy way, you will just need the camera work with the two moving bullets.",2년 전,0,

@SolemnStacker,"Amazing work and dedication, thank you for this! I wonder if there is any major temp difference of the surface of the lead/bullet, by shooting it out of a short barrel like that, vs a long barrel?  Barrel lengths of rifles at that time were often in the 30 inch to 40 inch length range.   1853 Enfield was 39"" barrel. I'd imagine it possible, with a longer dwell time traveling within the length of the barrel, the longer time exposed to the combustion gases  would increase the temperature of the bullets.   The lead being at a hotter temperature might result in higher probability of fusing together when striking each other. I'd imagine that the friction imparted from the Rifling would also cause temperature increase of the bullet, so traveling down 30-40 inches of rifling may also increase the lead temperature slightly! And of course the bullets are going to be traveling at higher speeds out of a longer barrel as their is more combustion built up over the barrel length to propel the bullet.  Some rifles/calibers you can easily witness a 50fps+ difference with just an inch of barrel change.  Going from a 20"" to 26"" barrel on a 308, I chrono'd about a 240fps increase.",2년 전,1,

@marine6680,"Problem with the bullets shattering and not fusing…  My first thoughts are 1) Hard cast lead projectiles instead of the soft lead used during muzzle loading eras 2) Modern velocities from modern powder are much higher than old black powder days.  The difficulty with converging in the intended location. You essentially cannot get bullets to behave in a consistent enough manner to make this process 100% reliable. This is an inherent limitation of the objects under test. These are variables that cannot be controlled to any exacting degree.  1) Even with an electronic ignition, you are relying on the consistency of the primer and powder mix, which will not be exact for every primer. Primer compound is often hand mixed. In theory the powder, if from the same batch/container will be the same, but the mix may not always be completely humongous enough to be perfectly consistent. Plus other factors will come into play 2) Small differences in powder amount will result in different burn rates and resulting velocities. It’s a narrow window you need to have them meet in, so small changes make a big difference 3) Even something as simple as how the powder is piled up/sitting in the case will affect the burn rate. The less powder you use, the less consistent. Filling a case full so that you get slight compression of the powder is more consistent, as there is no air gaps that make for room for the powder to shift. Slight compression can even help reduce differences caused by small differences in the amount of powder. 4) Even small differences in neck tension (the amount of force that that the cartridge case grips the projectile) can have a big impact on how the process progresses once fired. Which means another variable that affects the velocity and timing of the projectile. 5) Having the barrels offset at an angle already puts you at a disadvantage. A necessary measure for practical and safety concerns, but one that increases the difficulty  I get the desire to try to isolate variables for consistency in experiments, unfortunately small arms ammunition will never be as exacting as one would want for such experimentation scenarios where timing is crucial.  So let’s continue the video and see what gets figured out.  Edited for spelling and clarity…  Edit 2… Using shorter cases, yeah… That long jump from the chamber to the leade and then rifling will make for an extra variable.

@LordRaine,"As a big Napoleonic warfare buff with a hobby in ballistics, I'm almost 100% certain modern bullets aren't going to fuse specifically because of the materials they're made of. Older bullets that were cast in molds by the soldiers themselves were soft. It was a soft lead, melted over campfires. And that's why those bullets could fuse together if they collided in a one-in-a-million shot. It's a materials problem. I think you were 95% of the way there, but if you really wanted to duplicate the Fredericksburg Miracle, you'd need to have done what you originally mentioned, and cast your own bullets.

Another point of attention would be bullet size. The civil war Minié ball was 0.58 caliber and 500 grains. Relatively speaking, that's a lot of lead because (if I've got this correct) the .45 long Colt is about half of that: 200, 225 or 250 grain mostly. A period-correct Minié ball has not only more ductile lead to absorb energy, but also more mass to dissipate the same (accounting for flight loss) muzzle energy.",2년 전,9,
@gilbertdelgado6703,Since lead hardens after casting you should try using pure lead and shoot them the same day you cast them. I believe Jerry Mikulick made a video on this subject and showed It on his YouTube channel. This may or may not help but is worth a try. You might also try fluxing the front of the bullets to see if that helps.,2년 전,3,

Maybe I made sense? It's hard for me to explain to words but I get it perfectly in my thoughts 😅😂,2년 전,0,
@Hydrazine1000," @spacewater7  Not just soft. The lead alloy should be soft, yes, but also not contain elements that lower its melting point.

@OneFiercePuppy,"Lead has a fairly low fragmentation velocity, which is why modern rifle bullets are always jacketed or even monolithic copper alloy. Have you considered loading super heavy bullets that reach back into the case? Not only will it give you the advantage of a lower muzzle velocity, but since kinetic energy scales with the square of velocity, you'll double the drop off of velocity in the collision and very significantly reduce the amount of energy per mass of lead. I bet that your collision velocity is still way higher than those low-BC antique bullets, which probably had lousy muzzle velocity and surely bled off a lot of energy pushing through the atmosphere. Biggest downside is that you may need to cast your own bullets and even make your own die, but that's probably peanuts to you folks! Great video.

@nobodynoone2500,"3 thoughts: 1. The bullets used in the civil war were often shot from smooth-bore muskets. The spin, while helpful for ballistic repeatability, is a strong counter-force keeping them from fusing and instead directing more energy radially.  2. Metallurgy matters as you noted. The thinner the oxide layer the better I would assume. Many civil-war era bullets were cast on the battlefield, so are likely to have slightly less oxide layer. As to the actual lead vs alloy makeup, I am ignorant.  3. Even that 1' might be imparting enough influence to affect the meeting even if not plain or obvious. Try narrowing it as much as you can justify. Your risk tolerance is not for me to judge.  I suspect a longer rig might also benefit impact-site ballistic stability, but also increase error. The tradeoff may not be worth it.   Also I should note I feel you should have at least one shield lowered at all times when not firing. I noticed you had both open when loading the first barrel.

I also agree with @tis7963, having a lefthand rifling and righthand rifling could help.

When you did the first successful impact, you mentioned either hearing or feeling fragments land in the vegetation behind you, that should have kicked off questions about why the fragments landed behind you, examine if the current shielding was enough, and should/how you could contain the fragments to make everything even safer.  Also, I'd probably would have added a klaxon or some sort of warning horn, on the really off-chance there's some stupid backpacker or hiker who's decided to trespass on to private property in the middle of nowhere. And before you fellow keyboard warriors start typing at me how this could never happen, might I remind you that there currently is a lawsuit about a couple of hunters who may have ""trespassed"" in the middle of nowhere because they were going from one piece of public property to another, but they had to travel though a section where two pieces of private property ""touched corners"" effectively making a barrier.

@Guardian_Arias,"So amazing, from entertainment to educational to real world appreciation. As some who also works around military equipment, it cannot be understated that the most innocuous thing can actually be the most dangerous. The fact that the ballistic barrier both deflects fragments towards one direction and your procedures include approaching from only the opposite direction shows so much understanding and wisdom.  I am very surprised you guys didn't use pressurized/evacuated firings mechanism. Especially since you already have world leading experience with firing objects at supersonic speeds using pressurized air.  There are just so many variables in gun powder alone. When measuring single milliseconds, things like atmospheric temperature, atmospheric pressure, one barrel getting slightly more sun, the wires igniting the squib being hotter or colder, and so on should. Make a rather statistically significant difference in this application. Just as an example, the wire being slightly warmer for one squib would undisputibly increase resistance in that wire which will lower voltage and current at the squib which will make a tiny basically unmeasurable difference on how hot the initial molecules of gun powder get and how fast that initial chain reaction occurs.

@harlech2,"I think I might be able to shed some additional light on your failure to fuse the bullets together. Firstly, the weight of the bullet. A .58 caliber Minnie Ball would tip the scales at about 500 grains. Roughly 2x what the .45LC projectile weighs. That's a lot more material to you have to tear up before you reach 'splatterfication' (That's a Huntsville reloader term, btw) The second comes from velocity Those two projectiles in the museum probably met mid air with less than 1,000 fps combined velocity. Remember, smokeless powder is much more energetic than black powder. It becomes very difficult to drastically slow down just by reducing the amount of powder because you end up detonation and not deflagration. Pressures can vary wildly and thus velocities.  I think you are on the right path about the lead content of the bullet. Go back to your original idea of casting the bullets and use as little antimony as possible to harden the lead... just enough to keep lead from fouling the barrel. The move to black powder loadings. There are a ton of CASS loadings for 45LC that use black powder and I BET good money you can get your bullets to fuse.",2년 전,0,

Your problem with 45 is twist too fast bullet too hard velocity too fast,2년 전,0,

@MikeDQB,A shorter barrel should result in a lower bullet speed.  When a human is holding a firearm it also affects accuracy as there is a shorter distance between the front and rear sights.  With a setup such as the one in this video any differences in accuracy would be negligible.  Loading less powder will obviously cause less power and that's the obvious answer but you already did that.  You can certainly test the barrel length's affect on the speed yourself but there are many videos on YouTube that show the differences in speed by barrel length.  I hope this helps!,2년 전,0,
@edwardmauch2918,You need to use bullets made of pure lead like the war between the states weapons used.  The antimony in modern bullet alloy makes the lead brittle.

@DasHugh,"You should try it with larger, roughly 50 cal size projectiles... like with shotgun slugs. Use a smoothbore thats also an open bore with zero choke. This will make using less powder a less of an issue. They may even be able to be fired with the primer alone. Sort of like how a 40mm projectile works by using just a primer. The primers may help eliminate any fluctuations you'll have with powder. The 12 gauge slug will imo match the design of a mini bullet better too.  You're going to also have to clean the lead better where you want it to bond at. Any oxidation haze color is a good sign that they won't bond. During the time when these flukes happened they was using freshly casted lead, that was likely in a pouch and jumbling around, and scrubbing each other and that prepped the surface to bond best by doing so.  Trying to do this with such small bullets is the main part of your problem, that and the rifling. By the time you add enough force to free itself of the confines of the barrel it will already be moving at catastrophic speeds. So to me it seems like the bigger the better. Think two 4 bore sized slugs being more likely to bond and not damage each other vs two 556 tiny bullets that will zap each other. Hope this helps, good video",2년 전,0,

@mycosys,I think the temperature and shape are the keys - the black powder burns a lot slower and the minie ball is hollow at the back.

@RedGreene,I like this idea a lot.,2년 전,1,
@SolemnStacker," @mycosys  To me i think the issue is the temperature of the bullets.    They are shooting out of short barrels.  This will be traveling much slower than out of the barrel lengths common of that time period, 30 - 40 inches was pretty typical.  A 1853 Enfield rifle  had a 39 inch barrel. That is a much longer barrel which means the bullets have more time to be heated by the combustion gases, and also greatly increasing the travel speed of the bullets.   A one inch change in barrel length on most rifle calibers can easily translate into a 25-50 fps difference in the bullet speed. Also that is a much greater length of Rifling to encounter in a 39 inch barrel, which puts lots of additional friction on the bullets which would increase their surface temp.   With the increased friction and heat of the bullets imparted by a longer barrel length, I think the probability that they could get the bullets to fuse would greatly increase.  He mentioned the Gunpower used in their loads being slower, but seemed to be referencing the amount of powder used. Powder volume and Powder Burn rate are two totally different things.   The ideal Powder (burn rate) that would be most usable out of a short barrel would be vastly different from the type of gunpowder one would want for the same caliber bullet being fired out of a much longer barrel.   It's not just about decreasing or increasing the amount of powder, you need to utilize the right type of powder (e.g. 'Hogdon Titewad' has a much faster burn rate than 'Hogdon Varget' powder). I use Varget in my .308 Win custom loads, but I wouldn't use Titewad as it's too fast a burn rate and will finish burning long before the bullet leaves the end of the barrel, so no help from combustion to continue to force it's way down the barrel and spin itself from the friction caused by the Rifling.  If you used a very slow burn rate powder meant for rifles in a load for a handgun with a short barrel, you'd have a massive amount of unburned powder still after the bullet left the barrel which would result in some huge Fireballs out of the end of your handgun.",2년 전,3,

@minigpracing3068,"Why not recreate the original conditions? Rifle barrels in something larger than 50 caliber, black powder, soft (pure) lead bullets. The only tricky part would be creating the electric heater to start the powder, using a percussion cap might introduce a variable ignition timing, and flint would be much too variable. I'm guessing that the original example was moving in the 1300+ feet per second, though you might try lighter loads to increase possible fusion.  Alternate setup, drop down to 0.510 or 0.457 and use airguns. Lock time might take some variable timing adjustment, but shouldn't be impossible.  If you want to try black powder in 50 or 45, I can send cast bullets to try, same for 0.510 airgun (Umarex Hammer, Airforce Texan, etc.).

Honestly I'm not sure, just throwing ideas around. 👍",2년 전,3,
@SeanBZA," @SyntheticFuture  That old lead likely had signifigant amounts of silver and zinc in it as contaminant, which will enable fusion. Modern lead is likely contaminated with things like Antimony, Calcium and Cadmium, all there to make the lead slightly harder and thus more rigid, which is added to make it more suitable for the largest use of lead, in modern car batteries, which need a durable thin grid that will not degrade, so they can up capacity and lower the amount of lead not in active plate material. The silver and zinc are stripped out in production, as valuable by products, then the other materials are added.  The lead they have likely is from recycled batteries, they need either old lead off a roof, at least a century old, or to go to a mine and get a few kilograms of ore, refine it and get a lead that matches 200 year old lead. Probably needing to have a higher silver content in it , along with a little copper, zinc and tin added as well, which are all things that are present in roughly refined lead. A few kilograms of Galena, plus a silver coin and a few zinc pennies, will probably make a nice soft alloy, that will both cast well, have a good finish, and also stick together on impact.",2년 전,2,

While Hollywood and depicting the Revolutionary war, my mind goes to the scene of Mel Gibson melting toys to produce musket shot. I'm neither a weapons expert nor historian, but I can't help but wonder if there may have been some element of this, novice projectile production, that played factor in the example at the museum. Between the purity and the density of the molding, I think the key is a more pliable round. Speed is a factor to be sure, but I think it is secondary to the projectile hardness.",2년 전,0,

@gwbuilder5779,"Destin, Something to consider in your pursuit of bonding two bullets together. Modern bullets have a composite material for truer flight and a smoother, slicker (if that is a word) outer surface. I do not recall what the materials are, but I believe the intention was to reduce the amount of material that bonded to the rifling inside the barrel. Of course cheaper materials also mean profits. Anyway, the bonded bullets at the museum would have been a mostly pure lead allowing the two bullets to actually mold together almost like clay. My mind is not as sharp after a stroke some years ago, but I think you are on the right track slowing velocity. The material probably the key to getting them to actually fuse.

Of course compared to the momentum of the bullet along it's flight path, the rotational kinetic energy is relatively small (I think) Keeping up with your 'Intellectual Humility' (awesome term btw) I don't even know how to begin doing a calculation or simulation on this.

@ganymede3141,"After watching this, my conclusion is that the Civil War era museum piece is not the result of a high-speed collision (they did not have high-speed cameras at the time and had no way of knowing what two bullets colliding would end up looling like, they could only guess), which leads to the conclusion that the piece in the museum, although likely historical (old), is a forgery, to make it look like two bullets collided mid-air. And you can see this from the impact zone in the middle. It looks like the metal 'flowed' more slowly and almost melted together, which, as this video so well demonstrates, would not happen in a real high-speed collision. Yes, heat is generated by the collision, but lead has a certain thermal conductivity, and the heat generated by the collision could not have traveled through the entire mass of the bullet to soften it to the point of making it malleable enpugh to fuse the two bullets together on the insanely short timescale of the collision. It looks more like the museum piece was created by heating both bullets up to the point of plasticity, and then slowly pressing them together in a press. Also, due to the short impact timescales, the lead would not have time to 'flow' like the museum piece shows. It would plastically deform and fragment like in this very excellent video. So the museum piece might be a very nicely crafted piece of art, but not the result of a real collision.",2년 전,0,

@three-card-dead,"I was going to type a long winded reason to be skeptical of the original bullet shown in the museum... But I'm more interested in pointing out my thoughts and letting the comment section deliberate some ideas i'm not really seeing here.  The bullets fused together from the American Civil War at the beginning of the video show what appears to be a significant amount of lead. After watch Destin's video, we are aware how much explosive force is occurring even in the ""slow"" bullets. We don't need to recreate the scenario in which the specimen was made.  A simple test to find out if the museum piece is a fabrication would be simple to weigh the amount of lead and measure two minie balls. We know that it cannot exceed the lead weight of 2 minie balls since we expect at least small amounts of loss from the explosive interaction when fusing. We should also consider that those two bullet are not-in-fact minie balls from the amount of lead shown.  Now, There are many other examples out there that are much more plausible an example to what Destin's video subject is about. You can find many images online with a quick google search of 2 bullets after a collision, and some of them I'd have to say must be real.  -- Just to be clear -- I absolutely believe that bullets have met each other in the air during armed combat. In fact, I'd be willing to bet with the amount of bullets fired at each other across all the modern conflicts, it's happened many times but we've just not cared enough to notice them, or perhaps the speeds and materials the modern bullets are leveraging causes little trace to exist in modern combat as per the video example from SEM.

It may also be the oxides formed on the outside of the bullets from having sit for a while compared to possible recently poured balls in the civil war bullets.

@johnfaubion7720,"Modern bullets have antimony and sometimes tin, added to harden the bullet. This reduces fouling in the bore caused by today's higher velocities. The amount of antimony depends greatly on the source of the lead. This is often because the lead is sourced from tire shops in the form of wheel weights. Over the years I've cast many bullets. Pure wheel weight makes the bullets very hard to the point of shattering and quite dangerous for indoor ranges. I've also sourced lead from lead-cased telecommunication cables. This is 98-99% pure lead and makes for very soft bullets that hold together very well but foul the bore considerably. My ideal mix is 9# of pure lead with 1# of a wheel weight. This reduces the fouling to an acceptable level while providing a safe bullet for indoor shooting with Pyrodex.  Additionally, Pyrodex produces more pressure than the black powder used during the civil war. So, I would suggest using actual black powder along with pure lead bullets. This will more closely replicate the velocity and bullet type as found in the museum. If you would like, I can provide the pure lead bullets for 45LC.",2년 전,0,

I think you were spot on that the metallurgy was part of the problem in your experiment, but also perhaps the calibre. You were using a .45 while the Minié ball was .58 I believe. Also bullet shape changes flight and deformation on impact characteristics.

@jayreiter268,The original bullets must have met down range at an ideal low velocity. You are correct about the lead. Most lead for bullets is lead recovered from lead acid batteries and not pure lead. As home casters we used recovered wheel weights. As a side note bullets fired point blank into a sand barrel over 650 fps mostly shred or disintegrate. 30-06 ball quickly shreds the jacket. Few pieces are found at 14 inches. My guess you would need pure lead meeting below 650fps.That is hard to do at point blank range. May be with proper dies in a press.,2년 전,0,

@buckinthetree1233,"I haven't finished the video yet, but when steel changes temperature, it moves.  That steel I-beam painted black and given the length, it's going to move and flex as the outside temperature changes. It's not enough to cause misses, but it will change the point of impact.   You found a big issue when you equalized the jump to the lands.  Another thing you can do to lower the velocity is use a slower burning powder and shorten the barrel length.   They manufacture a wide variety of burn rates in powder.  Pistol powder and shotgun powder have the fastest rate because pistols have short barrels and need the powder to do its thing quickly.  Shotguns are smooth bore, so having a slower burning powder isn't beneficial for building pressure because there isn't much resistance caused by the pellets and wad moving down the barrel other than the mass of the projectile.  Rifles are going to have the slowest powder.  There is a greater resistance caused by the rifling in the barrel cutting groves in the bullet.  In rifles having a longer barrel, you have to have a slower burning powder because of the increased time the projectile is exposed to resistance.

@ericlund9398,"​ @tis7963  Seems likely this slow rotation would permit the fusion of the bullets. The travel through the space at the collision looked like about 1/2 inch per bullet or 1 inch total. Since the bullets are spinning in opposite directions the relative rotation at the point of collision would be about 1 rotation in 24 inches -- 2 x (1 in 48) -- yielding about 1/24th of a rotation (15 degrees) relative to each other using the less aggressive rifling of the civil war rifles.  I went back and looked at the video and it looked like the bullets got about 1 rotation running the length of the measuring device (which looks like about 12 inches) which means about 4 times as much rotation as an equivalent civil war bullet, or 60 degrees. That feels like enough of a difference to explain the bullets not fusing.  My theory of what happened in the aluminum wallet situation was, at lest partly, that the wallet material slowed the rotation of each bullet just enough that they collided with slow enough relative rotation to fuse. Each bullet, after all, independently hit the aluminum on its side of the wallet, and deformed the aluminum which would have given each bullet time to be grabbed a bit by the aluminum before the two hit each other and mashed the aluminum out of the way.

Prior to the Minié ball it was a lot slower to load because to engage the rifling the ball had to be hammered all the way down the barrel. So the two fused bullets shown at the beginning were almost certainly fired from rifles. The North used mostly the Springfield Model 1861 (although probably mostly Springfield Model 1842 smoothbore muskets at the start of the war.) whereas the South preferred the Enfield Pattern 1853 rifle-musket.

However, because the rifling of the barrel had to be engraved by hand, it was not until the mid-1800's that the Industrial Revolution made it common place. So, at the time of the civil war, there was mix of smooth bore and rifles, i.e. old and new tech. Rifles would have been likely been in the hands of snipers.

The minie ball was about 500 grains and the typical 45 colt is about 250 grains so it is only half of the mass.  I would think that increasing the mass while keeping the velocity low would increase the chance of sticking the two together before lowering the amounts of antimony or tin in the projectile.  I quick search and did not find any molds for a larger 45 colt projectile so that might mean buying new barrels and the associated rework. Maybe a 50 S&W barrel as they have 500gr projectiles and can be loaded down to lower velocities.,2년 전(수정됨),0,

@OldManMontgomery,"Notes prior to watching entire video.   1.  Lead bullet vs jacketed.  I think you (all) figured that out. 2.  Alloy bullet vs pure lead bullet.  As you mentioned, Civil War era bullets were pure (within manufacturing tolerence) lead bullets.  Those are far more malleable than current alloy (mostly lead, some tin and antimony).  The current allow reduces leading (the deposits left after shooting) by making the bullets harder, therefore more frangible.  You sort of grasped this.  Probably should cast pure lead bullets.  Pain in the foot to regularly clean barrels, but would make the bullets more malleable and easier to 'fuse'.    3.  Blunter vs Pointed bullet.  I think you (all) figured that out. 4.  Velocity high vs. low.  You did figure that out. 5.  Use of barrel only guns vs commercial rifles or handguns.  You did figure that out very well. Good job. 6.  Reloader works on consistency in accuracy, taking loading density, 'jump' to leade and insuring consistent velocity.  You did understand this, I thing much could be solved with a shorter cartridge, with the barrel chambered for the cartridge chosen.    All in all, great job.

@Enterprisefranchising,"OK, I can help you. I'm actually surprised a little that you didn't think about this. Here are a couple of the reasons you did not get the result you were looking for is this. 1. The mass of a mini ball is significantly larger than the 45 long colt you are using. There is more there to absorb the shock. 2. The speed of the bullets are affected by two factors, one, muzzle velocity and distance. A mini ball getting fired from a musket is actually moving quite slowly and my guess is that the distance of two bullets that were fused together was between 50 and 150 yards, which means that these bullets slowed down quite a bit from the muzzle. Unlike your frame where they were hitting in just a few feet away. 3. This is the only part I am guessing a little, but I think the hardness of the lead is different in lead you use today verses the lead they used in bullets back then.   The best way to accomplish what you are trying to achieve is to research the actual muzzle velocity of a mini ball musket and then try to determine at what distance the two original mini balls traveled before hitting. They look like they were deformed pretty close  to the same which tells me that they were approximately the same distance to the place the two bullets met. Then determine how fast the bullets were traveling when they hit. If they were 100 yards away, you can go to a ballistic calculator based on bullet weight, ballistic coeffeciency, and original speed. This will give you the FPS speed they are traveling at a set distance. You can imitate those variables by adjusting the speed at the barrel.   You really need to use a bullet the same caliber and weight to give you the best chance to duplicate the original shot. I would love to collaborate with you to help you achieve your goal.",2년 전,1,

A softer lead might help reduce the brittleness and shattering you saw in the first impact.  Casting your own, even for the colt might be the way to go.  Try to find an alloy with little or no antimony, which increases the hardness.  For the velocity I imagine that the two mine bullets were shot from across a field and had lost quite a bit of velocity, reducing the energy of the impact might help eliminate the shattering as well.

You mentioned, and others in comments, have mentioned the lead you used. Its probable that the modern lead has other alloying elements that make the slug more brittle than the alloy used in the Civil War. I’m assuming the alloy used almost 2 centuries ago was closer to pure lead which is very soft and could possibly fuse like you want.   I looked through the comments and didn’t see any mention of the powder used. You showed the reloading process but didn’t mention the powder used, which I’m not familiar with but appeared to be disc shaped. Would using a powder similar to that used by Soldiers of the era work better? Maybe some Triple777 or Pyrodex to emulate the black powder used?",2년 전,1,

@TAKIZAWAYAMASHITA,"I was thinking that when I first saw the few attempts and nothing sticking especially that momentum stop one. This worked back then because they used softer lead rounds and the shape was different. Modern ammo is harder uses a different shape. Plus the speed difference. That old ammo used black powder, which is slower and weaker than modern smokeless powder. Hence why your bullets won't stick as modern cartiages have to be made harder to not break under the power of smokeless powder. There's a reason you cannot fire black powder ammo with smokeless powder. Same for why you can't use modern ammo in a black powder rated gun",2년 전,0,

@jimlongley9531,"You anticipated my comments about velocity and lead composition but I have another, or two.  I have seen that display myself and wonder if caliber might also have something to do with fusing in this case.  The bullets in the display appear to about .56 caliber, normal for the era, which has a lot more sectional density than a .45, and it would have been propelled by black powder, which could possibly develop even less velocity.    The museum display states that the bullets are two Minie Balls which adds another factor to consider, the actual construction of the projectile itself (goes back to sectional density) with the Minie being a relatively long hollow base slug instead of a solid slug.  Looking at the videos it appears that most of the destruction of the bullets could be the result of the back part of the bullet retaining significant velocity and driving the nose to fragment, where a Minie with its ""skirt"" might just collapse into the resulting fusion.

Having some inner monologue firing off a bunch of questions, potential problems, potential solutions to those problems, etc.  it just gets the grey matter sloshing around in the skull and it feels great,  it almost makes me feel a part of the process (even though obviously I'm not).  As to the fusion problem I believe the issue is in fact speed, as these bullets will not have been fired from the distance you're firing them so they're slowing down in flight,  now making them farther and farther apart most likely would be an exercise in futility to get them to hit at the same spot but maybe you could figure out what that speed is needed by slowing down the bullets manually,  maybe have one bullet be fixed in space so that the relative speed between the bullets would be half the speed of one bullet, or perhaps don't do gun powder to fire them instead maybe use high pressure air (baseball cannon miniaturized?) so you can more accurately control that speed without needing reloads.   Then once you have your rough speed required for fusion without destruction, then you can go about figuring out how to get that speed with gunpowder fired bullets, heck maybe you go back in time and don't use jacketed bullets but maybe external powder charges.",2년 전,0,

@Kelnx,"I honestly think its a materials issue. It's very likely that Civil War era lead had quite a few impurities in it compared to modern lead used for bullets. Lead has a low melting point for a metal (600ish F), is soft, and dense. The sudden added heat on impact might make pure lead act almost like a fluid (rapid sliding apart of grains) which causes the breaking apart we see in the HSC footage. Lead with certain impurities might behave differently and stay more solid allowing the pieces to fuse instead of splatter. Been a long time since I studied any materials science, so I could be wrong but my gut tells me that is the issue. I also vaguely remember reading that as rifle velocities increased, jacketing lead became more necessary to keep it from breaking apart as it has a tendency to do at higher temperatures and muzzle velocities.",2년 전,0,

@NotElmerKeith1,"Good Job!  I do think a pure lead bullet would be more likely to fuse than what you're using.  It appears that your lead bullet is mostly lead, but almost all have a bit of tin, zink, or antimony to increase the hardness (Brinell value).  Pure lead bullets are not commercially available (I don't think) as they will foul your barrel after a dozen or less rounds.  Pure lead has a Brinell of 5 ---it may take an old time with the experience to cast some for you.  It can be done with great precision ----I have shot 1/2"" 100 yard groups with hand cast 45-70 bullets ----they can be very consistent.  I don't have the knowledge base, but there are people who do.   You may be able to find a higher lead concentration in 45 Colt rounds commercially loaded with black powder or ones designed for Cowboy Action Shooting (as they are more traditional and designed to be fired at a lower velocity).  You could disassemble the black powder rounds and remake them with the smokeless powder you finally used (looked like Clays).    Asking a pro shooter who reloads EXCEEDINGLY accurate ammunition may be worth while --Erik Cortina is an absolute master.",2년 전,11,

You'd end up with the bullets meeting with matching rotation instead of opposing, and that would eliminate one source of motion that could prevent a fusing event.",2년 전,23,
@BleuSquid," @Mikado80813  That was my first thought, but I looked up the Minié ball and that bullet was designed specifically for rifling: ""The development of the Minié ball was significant because it was the first projectile type that could be made a loose enough fit to easily slide down the barrel of a rifled long gun, yet maintain good accuracy during firing due to obturation by expansion of the bullet's base when fired.""",2년 전(수정됨),5,

@rigrmortis3393," @Mikado80813  I'm not an engineer but I'm pretty sure the accuracy would drop dramatically, even in this short distance, without the rifling. I could be wrong though. Now that you bring it up though, I wonder if a different twist rate to the rifling could affect the process?  Edit: I might be making the wrong analogy but think of it like a knuckleball pitcher vs a traditional pitcher. The knuckleballer wants almost no spin and instead lets the imperfections of the ball (seams, thread, etc.) move it in erratic ways while the traditional pitcher imparts spin to make it cut through the air, strike more accurately and/or move in very particular ways.",2년 전(수정됨),2,

@streetfightinmanrs,"A few things that I think affect the results: -You may need to cast your own lead bullets. Most manufacturers today will add a bit of tin to make them harder, so eliminating that tin should help stop the bullet from fragmenting. -The Minie ball fired from the Springfield rifled muskets had a concave base in order to expand to meet the rifling in the musket.  -The minie balls fired from Springfields were .58 caliber opposed to the .45 used in your tests which means there are some additional factors needed to replicate what you had seen in the museum. -The .58 caliber balls weighed 500 grains opposed to the 200 grains of the .45 LC. There is a 600ish grain difference in mass transfer between the two bullet types colliding. -The typical .58 traveled at about  944 FPS from a 40in barrel as opposed to the 900 FPS from the .45, usually in a 5 3/4 in barrel.  - the combat range which the bullets fired against each other could have also affected the result for the museum’s example, as the muzzle energy of the rounds could have dissipated a little bit if both muskets were fired at their maximum effective range of 300yds, intercepting around 150 yards.  If I had to guess, going with a soft lead .58 traveling around 600-750 FPS would probably yield the result you are looking for while staying generally true to what happened.",2년 전,2,
@ihdieselman,"@SmarterEveryDay hey Destin, I wonder If the reason that the bullet fused through the wallet was because the aluminum had stripped away part of the bullet exposing fresh unoxidized lead. Perhaps the soldiers bullets had been carried in a satchel pouch and the bullet tips were freshly polished as a result? Or perhaps it's because they had rammed it down the barrel and that polished the end of the bullet? That would be an interesting hypothesis to test. Also, maybe there is an alloy in the lead that the bullets are made of that is preventing them from fusing. Try casting some bullets with pure lead. Maybe it would change it.

It may be possible to acquire samples (civil war bullets can be purchased from collectors) even ones from that exact battlefield.

He even mentions it towards the end of the video.  I definitely think the pure lead bullets have properties that makes them fusing together when hitting each other much more likely.

@The_infection_1,"Maybe switch out the barrels for smooth bores. Currently when the bullets impact each other they are rotating in opposite directions. This could be making it more difficult for the bullets to fuse. Also, I believe a smooth bore would allow for reduced powder loads.  Your accuracy would be reduced, but at the distances you're shooting I'm not sure it would be an issue.",2년 전,0,

@kaboom-zf2bl,as for an option for fused bullets ... try a few inches of ballistic gel ... enough to slow each bullet and maybe contain more of the fragments ... also once you hopefully achieve a two bullet fusion that can be seen ... do up an extensive report on every shot and every detail ... and OFFER it to the military sniper school along with the full video raw ... and an edited version of the shots .... the american snipers will learn a ton from this report and video making their knowledge better for their jobs ...,2년 전,0,

The PHYSICS part of it is over in nano seconds; but the safety and engineering issues... they take weeks and months, at least, to be thought over and to be constructed... so those two bullets could meet ever so precisely, so a super fast camera could take a good shot at the nano second they hit each other, like those particles do, at the LHC at CERN...",2년 전,0,

Since Minnie bullets were made from the softest lead available, and what you were shooting was likely an alloy bullet, he thinks it would be worthwhile to run the test again with a more pure lead content.

@Biker118347,"Without reading other comments, may I offer this. 1. The Civil War guns were not as powerful so bullet impact would have been less forceful. 2. Distance between guns would also lower impact. 3. Modern bullets, though strictly controlled, do have a slight variance in power resulting in a variable that is uncontrolled, which gives you the misses. Also temp of the barrels may cause an up, down or sideways miss. All in all, the hits you were getting were almost as reliant on chance as the engineering. Great video.",2년 전,0,

@WilliamStrohmetz,"I'm at 19:26, I don't know what you did to solve the non-fusing issue, but I have a theory: distance.

@DaSharedVideos,"The bullets/mini-balls seem to be fragmenting rather than deforming like the Fredericksburg Minie balls in the display exhibit.   If you haven't done so already, you may want to considering doing a metallurgical analysis of civil war era Minie balls to make sure they have the same ductile characteristics.  Temperature may also be a factor.  Are you cold firing the bullets using cold compressed air or are you also simulating live black powder fire and long rifled barrel friction to get the Minie balls up to temperature?  Another consideration is that if the Fredericksburg Minie balls were fired at a considerable distance apart, that their velocities may have been a lot less than in your demonstration tests which could allow for more time for them to deform and fuse.  Have you also tried reducing the relative velocities of the Minnie balls?  For a more controlled sampling of the fragments, have you considered laying some type of clean substrate under the test apparatus, such as a clean white drop cloth, canvas or just a blue or green tarp so that you have a better chance to collect all the fragments?  If you're using lead, then all the lead fragments flying about are likely to contaminate the soil.",9개월 전,0,
