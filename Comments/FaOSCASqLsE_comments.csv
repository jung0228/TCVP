The Sith, where I came from, and if I were born for the force of imperialism instead of America... ironic choosing freedom as an imperial born to the dark side. Yes, I am the spy.  I had learned through advancing my sleeping material that it is well to have The Raven Task Force and the A.Seat. If we allowed the citizens to maintain their leisure then expected them to serve then the empire would crumble, but we all... like I said, I chose freedom for the force, answered directly to the Sith, have an outstanding record in obedience, tolerance, and pleasantry. I would also free all the stormtroopers. The future isn't lab. We cannot allow the empire to be made a laughing stock by enforcing citizen birth rates by clones... anyway sir, that's just my opinion on the matter... but I am no one today, and someone else tomorrow.

The main female (haven't seen her in anything else so idk her name without looking) completely sells the movie. She's a gem and I hope to see more of her. Adam really soars in this film because he has so much to work with.  It is gritty and definitely wouldn't let kids watch it, but they picked the best cast to back up such an incredible script.  If you get the chance to see it, I hope you like it as much as I do! 😁🙌👍",2년 전,0,

@RasMajnouni,"Age 17 moved in on my own apartment.TV? Since 1970 have not seen a show. Yet, I admit, when much later first seeing YouTube I had a 3 minute peekaboo of   S N L  & closed it. ""Oh how the Mighty have fallen"" (USA) Being cynical was the NEW Hip and when all the Americans can be Hip, what IS hip? The same assholes you have seen on S N L from 1975 until last night. Most of the world looks at MERCA and we  sadly shake our heads in sadness.  S N L : ""WAYNE""  played the most cynical slob. It wasn't Mike Myers per se ,he acted the role of the most cynical low-life in the film. Wayne is the opposite of Garth. No human is at fault for a bit less intelligence. Its who and what that human was given : an under-average human intelligence or an over-average human intelligence. The human brain is simply a cold slab of meat!  An IQ of 84 or an IQ of 104, same flesh. But a brain which acknowledges the HOT beating heart as well as the soul can recieve life from it's own human heart and Godly soul  ,rule the heart by fanning his own heart flame to a simple human life that respects all others. WAYNE had no respect for Garth,no respect for all the people in the film and NO respect for:""Wayne!!! The Wayne's of the WORLD I ever came across my so far 69 years were side-stepped by myself as if they were a small piece of dog shit.

It'd be like if your very first introduction to Vader was episode 2 Anakin (I wonder how cringey teen Anakin would have been if he was on the dark side then?). Imagine lining up all the main movie Sith. You got Palpatine, Darth Maul, Count Dooku, Darth Vader, and then Kylo Ren. One is clearly just a disappointment. Even in episode 1 with almost 0 lines, Maul was more badass than Kylo.",3년 전,0,

@jesusfollowerswomenministries,"Only Jesus is the only way to Heaven, all other ways outside of Christ leads to hell. That's the truth that will never change. John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him I Am the Way the Truth and the Life no man cometh unto the Father but by me. Only Jesus is God and is the only one who can save us from hell and from sin, He's the only one who went to the cross for us and paid for our sin debt and God rose Him on the third day and is alive forever more and only God can do all this and no other never can and never did nor will do as God did and does. Know also because of what Jesus did we can saved, redeemed, forgiven, justified, purified, sanctified and reconciled to God our Heavenly Father and creator and get filled with His Holy Spirit. God offers forgiveness to anyone and everyone who will believe and trust in Jesus Christ for salvation and repent of their sins. This includes those involved in any sin. Once salvation through Christ is received, God will begin the process of destroying the acts of the flesh (Galatians 5:19-21) and developing the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23). Sometimes God removes our desire for a particular sin and other times He gives us strength to resist temptation. The process of transformation takes a lifetime. When we fail, God is faithful to forgive and cleanse (1 John 1:9). He is also faithful to complete His work in us (Philippians 1:6). The promise of a ""new creation"" is available to anyone who will trust in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17). When Jesus saves us our past is gone our sins are washed away by his precious blood and we new creations in Christ Jesus📖🕊2 Corinthians 5:17-18 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; God bless and I pray God will reveal Himself to you all and you all will experience Jesus true love true salvation true Holy Spirit true goodness true truth and go Him and get saved Amen",4년 전,0,

I strongly suggest you learn all about her and the vitalrole she has during the clone wars, could you imagine if yoda was feeling ill she could pretent to be im for the day like twins.

Mountains and snow-capped peaks? Is Paradise the unity of mankind and peace on earth? Paradise is actually the place where God dwells. Most people think they will go to Paradise when they die, but let’s see if that’s true. Have you ever lied or stolen? Liars and thieves won’t be in Paradise. Have you lusted after others, or dishonored your parents? Have you cursed the God who created Paradise? If any of these are true, you’ve offended Him and broken His Law. Instead of entering Paradise, the penalty for your crimes will be eternal death in Hell. However, God offers Paradise to those who bring Him a sinless payment for their sins. Your goodness and good deeds are not that sinless payment. God will only accept the sacrifice of His sinless Son, Jesus Christ. Anyone who repents and believes in Him will be cleansed of their sins and given that free ticket to Paradise! Jesus promised the thief on the cross who trusted in Him: “…Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.” (Luke 23:43) Don’t live in a “fool’s” Paradise thinking this life is all there is.

Or better yet lack of things going on.    Sometimes I feel like I can see exactly what my mom is thinking, and it's terrible. Shes mean, but holds back.    One of my last long term exes was beautiful, but dumb as rocks. I remember getting our new apartment watching her try to put together something. I could see her slowly processing the shapes and screws. While saying Herbalife is not a ""triangle"" scheme.    I had the  like god help me. This is the one? That's when the sunk cost fallacy kicked in. An epiphany I didn't like.    I couldn't imagine seeing INSIDE the mind of an actual stupid person. I'm stupid too.

Watch the Vanity Fair interview, most British celebrities says Dick's did the worst fake British accent in Mary Poppins 😂😂 There's some British actors that can play Snape and don't have to fake an accent cuz their British accent is already natural. You see why American actors don't play British characters that much these days and even in the past, because of the accent that they can't get it right and the concern of them losing their fake British accent in the middle of the movie.

So no, I do not think that there is even the slightest chance that they mean Starkiller.",4년 전,0,

@tanletheorymarajadesateles6722,"GI really agree with Star Wars Theory, it’s poor writing when there is no set plot for Rey.         Rey should have been Han Solo Daughter, she felt so connected to Leia and Han!!!         That’s why I always believe in George Lucas storywriting, it was the story that showed a Farmboy coming from a Dessert Planet, then building hope, accomplished a feat (Destroying Death Star), train with the best Jedi Master, Realize the Worst of his Fears, but with perseverance brings his corrupt father back to the Light Side of the Force!  The best scene in all of Rise of Skywalker was lifting the X Wing that scene made me cry  Luke was able to bring a burnt corrupt Machine Monster, who killed millions of people, slaughtered children, 2nd most powerful Sith but was able to control his emotions, when his nephew had dark thoughts?          Legends Luke Skywalker was way more powerful than in the Last Jedi, and the Luke we should have got. The Luke from the Expanded Universe who fought Abeloth, now that’s a Jedi Masters             if there was Mara Jade it would have been very very much better! I think that Mara Jade is underrated  I think the Sequels has completely loss the fundamentals of Star Wars.  I was really excited to see Star Wars Theory Vader Fan Film Shards of the Past as he had massive plans that he revealed June of this year. The majority of lines for the first episode were pertinent and appropriate. The film’s cinematography was phenomenal. The CGI was near the quality of the prequels which was surprising. The Clones voices were so well done, it felt like Star Wars.   I really wanted to see Vader Episode 2",5년 전(수정됨),5,

@curanp2,"I'll use the ""found Kylo Ren's lightsaber"" part as an example of why I think this skit is fucking garbage  Jokes are about absurd moments, or things that are out of the ordinary. In this case, the fact that a simple worker would have access to Kylo's saber is what's supposed to be ""funny"". But there is no set up, there is no ""I was able to get the light saber because X"". There is no ""X"", he simply goes out of sight for 1 second and then comes back with the saber. This is lazy writing, it's pretty much the same lack of character development that Star War movies fell for, only to have more screen time to add cgi saber battles and dumb explosions.   Here's how a good comedy writer would have thought about this scene: He would have tried to make Kylo come up with funny excuses to explain why he had access to the saber. He could have said ""I took it away from him when he was in the toilet"", then his coworkers could have made fun of him for going to the toilet with another man. Something like that. Something, just anything. ANY FUCKING THING. Not this stupid garbage. ""How to go from point A to point B? Easy! 1) I'm in point A 2) now I'm in point B. Brilliant! Another successful skit!"".   Another clear example: When the stormtrooper kicks Kylo's wrench, WHAT COULD WE POSSIBLY WRITE FOR HIM TO SAY? I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE SOMETHING FUNNY? SOMETHING CREATIVE? NO, LET'S JUST MAKE HIM DESCRIBE VERBATIM WHAT JUST HAPPENED. And so, Kylo just looks at the guy and he delivers this brilliant line...""Hey you kicked my wrench!"" Oh wow. So creative. So imaginative.   fuck SNL, fuck star wars prequels and fuck you morons",5년 전,0,

I don't usually use this word as I understand it is overused, but I thought at the time that it fit best. When I wrote this comment I needed something to make me laugh.  Many things had been happening in my life that i won't detail and this video didn't only take my mind off of it but brought me a considerable amount of joy and caused me to actually laugh in tears. That is what the phrase ""literally killed me"" means. If that bothers you then just ignore the comments section. Comments aren't meant to be scrutinised under a magnifying glass.

You take that and the physical and psychological injury that Kylo had when he kills Han and it explains it. In the same way that we saw the other way around in the rise of skywalker with Rey being defeated. She was the one hurt in the soul and he was at full capacity ^^,5년 전,3,

@jesusfollowerswomenministries,"Jesus who is the one and only true God and Creator came to earth 2000+ years ago to go to the cross to pay our sin debt in full. His sacrifice was sufficient to pay the penalty for the sins of the world (1 John 2:2). A created being could not pay the infinite penalty required for sin against an infinite God. Only God could pay such an infinite penalty. Only God could take on the sins of the world (2 Corinthians 5:21), die, and be resurrected, proving His victory over sin and death and that true and only God is JESUS! And He did all that because He loves us and wants to save us and have a relationship with us. JESUS is the only way to Heaven, only He can save us from sin and from hell ( Luke 5:32, John 14, Romans 6:23). Jesus is waiting for you to come to Him, He won't cast you away from Himself if you come to Him. He calls us all to repentance, He loves us and wants to save us. believe and have faith in God then the Holy Spirit will come in and lead you to repent of your sins and God will forgive you of your sins and cleanse you by the blood of Jesus and you'll get born again by His Holy Spirit and have His salvation, you will become a new creation (John 3:3-19).

There are plenty of good reasons why Rey can do what she does, and it's reaching to say that she suddenly knows how to use her powers. Watch Empire, where Luke suddenly knows how to force pull his lightsaber ""wHeRe DiD tHe tRaInInG cOmE fRoM!"". I think these are good characters, but they're not being written well. The stories they're in aren't being done justice and they're not being utilized as they should. They shouldnt have even taken off Kylos mask until maybe the third movie. Keep him in a mask, and keep him mysterious, all the while revealing more and more about him, little by little. That would have at least strengthened his character by keeping us invested in who he is.  I do agree with everything else you said.

Rey (replica female Luke) is bland and there are so many debates over her being a Mary Sue. Finn SHOULD have been amazing (Ex stormtrooper horrified by the first orders invasion/genocide turns coat and joins resistance) but it fell flat and they stopped developing.   Poe is a poor mans Solo. The original characters were either killed off (smart move Harrison) or completely character assassinated (that WAS NOT the Luke we grew up with)  Kylo is the antagonist but I’m rooting for him, Luke fucking tried to assassinate him while he slept the first instance that he may turn to the dark side! Speaks volumes on Luke’s part as Jedi master and mentor. Thank fuck my teachers didn’t try to off me once they realised that I was a little shit!  Terrible movies BUT Kylo is halfway decent and will be the only reason I see this excuse of a trilogy through to completion.

@stevethea5250," @joeybulford5266  Victorian public school students will start to receive access to on-campus mental health professionals from mid-July.  The rollout of the government’s $51.2 million election promise will put 190 psychologists, social workers and mental health nurses into secondary schools. 33 schools will get them in term three.  “It will take some time to have these professionals recruited and the services offered right across the state,” Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters on Wednesday.  “But I’m very confident this is exactly what’s needed in an increasingly complex world, providing vulnerable Victorians and particularly teenagers the care and support they need.”  From term four, another 21 secondary schools will also get them and eventually every state high school will get one-five days a week of support from a practitioner.  See the full list of schools below. Metropolitan Melbourne  • Mount Erin Secondary College (Frankston Campus) • Dromana Secondary College • Bentleigh Secondary College • Beaumaris Secondary College • Brighton Secondary College • Cheltenham Secondary College • Elwood College • Frankston High School (7-10 Campus; VCE Campus) • Western Port Secondary College • Melbourne High School • Mentone Girls Secondary College • Mordialloc College • Mount Eliza Secondary College • Mckinnon Secondary College • MacRobertson Girls High School • Parkdale Secondary College • Prahran High School • Rosebud Secondary College • Oakwood School (Caulfield Park Community Campus; Noble Park Campus) • Carrum Downs Secondary College • Westall Secondary College • Glen Eira College • Elisabeth Murdoch College • Patterson River Secondary College • Sandringham College (Holloway Road 10-12 Campus; Bluff Road 7-9 Campus) • Mornington Secondary College • Monterey Secondary College • McClelland Secondary College • Somerville Secondary College • Albert Park College  Regional Victoria  • Apollo Bay P-12 College • Lavers Hill K-12 College • Grovedale College • Belmont High School • Geelong High School • North Geelong Secondary College • Lorne P-12 College • Matthew Flinders Girls Secondary College • Newcomb Secondary College • Oberon High School • Bellarine Secondary College (Ocean Grove Campus; Drysdale Campus) • Western Heights Secondary College (Vines Road Campus) • Lara Secondary College • Colac Secondary College • Northern Bay P-12 College • Surf Coast Secondary College",6년 전,2,

@TheDen-ec9xe,"​ @thesprawl2361  The thing he had going with Rey in TLJ amounted to nothing. All that Force Skype back and forth reverted back to her being a fucking self-righteous Mary Sue that is morally unbreakable, and he's still an autistic manchild hellbent on his nihilistic quest for nothing, since he's too fucking incompetent to even lead the First Order.  ""He's a deeply fucked up character in that film.""  Yeah, as in deeply half-assedly written. He turned evil because ""Snoke had already turned his heart"". How ? By telling him what ? By seducing him with what proposal ? We don't know, so why the fuck should I be invested in what's essentially an edgy manchild screeching for attention ?  ""I loved TLJ and Kylo Ren was brilliant in it. A dramatic improvement over how he was in TFA.""  Congratulations for coming out as a Disney shill, and Kylo Ren was fucking laughable in TLJ, the Ben Swolo meme (thankfully dead now) proves it furthermore. How exactly is keeping him an aimless emo overgrown baby filled with steroids an improvement over Vader fanboy (which by the way, seems the way he's gonna be again in Ep.9) ?",6년 전,1,

I wonder when SNL will finally realize that there are people out there that knows exactly who they are and what they are doing...and know that they each are characters being played by certain people who have been in the shadows using these fake identities to fear monger citizens into voluntarily giving up rights with fake news and fake events..SNL is nothing more than than the royal families that established the United States to get control of the world by using deception..the figured out a long time ago that electricity was the key to understanding the universe...it was the fake character Benjamin Franklin that came up with the idea to use fake news and events to fear monger citizens into voluntarily giving up rights...since those times they have been intentionally dividing the people using fake news and events... divide and conquer...they have intentionally used their fake identities to spread false information and have been using public funds to develope new technologies and use there fake identities to start businesses using  those new discoveries..but don't anyone even worry because better days are right around the corner...at least for everyone that has no involvement with what they are doing...hundreds of years these assholes have been intentionally killing people...guess who volunteered to be slaves for everyone else for eternity.. it's only fair that an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth and slavery for slavery... I thank you idiots in advance for your willingness to volunteer to be the slaves for everyone else...that is if you are lucky... and honestly... I don't see much luck in ur future...unless you  consider death over slavery luck ...then Maybe...but that is not for me to decide so personally... I can care less what will be your ultimate destiny of the royal families on this planet... but there is one thing for sure...ur pyramid scheme has been turned upside down and there is a very huge difference between fear mongering people with the truth...and fear mongering citizens with fake news and fake events...only one of them is morally and criminally wrong...don't think u will be able to blame everything on your fake identities because that sure as fuck is not going to happen...we already have all the proof that  is necessary to prove that you  pre-write and pre-record history because of the method u are  deceiving everyone...that is why a very large group of voluntarily enlisted military veterans at the organizations I belong to...have ""predicted"" and use that word extremely loosely .. exactly what will happen to prove that history is pre-written and pre-recorded...ur fucked regardless... I want you to understand that I am only speaking what I believe to be the truth... therefore...

@OtterloopB,"Guys... have you noticed how wicked and dire the world is becoming as of late?  Take a moment and consider the state of our world:   -The Middle East is at the tipping point.   -The world hates Israel.   -There is a growing demand for a one world economic, political, and religious system.   -There are wars and rumors of war (especially in regards to World War 3).   -Racism is some of the worst it's ever been.   -Hatred and madness is spilling over into riots in the streets.   -Perversion is running rampant.   -The weather is out of control.   -We're mutilating unborn children and mistakenly believing we have a ""right"" to do so.   -Education is in the toilet.   -Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are happening in more and more diverse places at a highly alarming rate.  ... You getting the picture? Something is deeply wrong with our world.  None of what you see going on in the world is normal or good. In fact, much of what you see happening around the globe coincides with Bible Prophecy. The Bible says many of these things would occur before Christ returns. You can investigate it for yourself. The Bible says in the last days there will be: wars and rumors of war; a one world economic/governmental/religious system; Kingdoms against kingdoms and the seas and people raging; Violence and perversion on a grand scale; Earthquakes in diverse places, etc.  ... Sounds exactly like our world today, doesn't it? If that weren't enough to chew on, consider this: The Books of John and Acts combined total up to over 120+ historically verified facts. When you consider that, it gets a little difficult to write the Bible off as fairy tales when history and archaeology are on its side...  Are you paying attention yet? God is screaming at us! He warned us thousands of years in advance that all of what you are seeing would happen- and it is! It's all coming together to the letter! In fact, if you doubt the validity of Bible Prophecy, I encourage you to consider this: the Bible warns that in the last days that Damascus will become ""a ruinous heap."" It will become a no man's land inhabited by no one. Use that as a litmus test of sorts. Keep an eye on Damascus. If it never falls then feel free to throw out the Bible. But when Damascus does fall in the not too distant future... You'll see God is no liar. God also declares that the only way to heaven is to accept Jesus as your Savior. Good deeds won't get you there nor do good deeds erase a bad deed. If you murder somebody, that person is still dead even if you do nothing but good deeds after murdering them. You need a Savior who will forgive you of that murder because you can't save yourself.  Yet, many people will still discount God and His goodness even when shown evidence that the Bible is valid and coming true. A lot of people have difficulty believing in God because of all the evils in the world. However, this discounting of the only Person who can save you may be less of an inborn frustration or complaint and more of a hidden longing, placed there by the very One who planted His own image into the body and soul of every person He created. Where does this deep-seated intuition that suffering and pain are not right come from if we're just amalgamations of atoms, as the atheists say…?  What if, perhaps, this intuition points to something deeper? Something built into ourselves that reflects our true nature and identity? What if this revulsion against suffering and pain is a reminder of paradise, on one hand, and an anticipation of New Jerusalem on the other?  Perhaps it's the cry of the human spirit for God. For our Creator. The only One who can, and will, fix this mess.  As I've said, time is short. Bible Prophecy is happening at a frightening pace. You could argue, ""You're just being paranoid like all the other fundamentalists. Haven't we always had these types of problems?"" Sure... But never at this magnitude or frequency! Check the news for yourselves. The amount of earthquakes, bloodshed, madness and horrific weather events are off the charts! Don't be deceived into thinking it's not as bad as it seems out there. The devil wants you to stay anemic and apathetic. Don't let that jerk deceive you. Or win your soul. Satan wants nothing more than for you to roll your eyes, scoff under your breath and put this whole ""God"" business under the rug. He wants you to continue believing that Hell and God and the afterlife is nonsense. That the Bible is all fairy tale nonsense of Jesus riding dinosaurs; that it's stuff only the weak-minded, brainwashed people believe. He'll gladly coax your pride, making you believe you're far too ""reasoned"" to believe in such things. However, Satan believes the Bible. Every jot and word of it. He doesn't see it as fairy-tale nonsense since it details his coming destruction. He just doesn't want YOU to believe it so he can drag your soul down with him when it's time for him to go!  Don't let him drag you down into the grave with him. Don't be played! Hell is a very real place-- a place of eternal separation, loneliness, and despair. No friends, no family... just you. A-L-O-N-E. In the dark. Miserable for all eternity. If hell wasn't real, what on earth was Jesus willing to die for to protect us from...? Bill Nye thinks hell won't be so bad; he claims he's willing to hold onto his darwinian beliefs even if it means he's hellbound for it. I hope you won't share in that kind of disillusioned thinking...  Before you're sent to hell, you'll appear at the Great White Throne Judgment. Whether you believe in hell or not makes no difference--that giant throne you want to avoid seeing at all costs will be your destiny if Christ isn't your Savior. At the Great White Throne Judgment the books are thrown wide open and the past is recalled. Details and sins long forgotten or covered up are brought to light. Plenty of people will have a list of good deeds: acts of charity, love, and sacrifice. All their good deeds will be carefully considered... but none of them will be good enough to gain them admittance into heaven. The good deeds they did will have an impact on where they end up in the lake of fire, however. Hell will not be the same for everyone, but it will still be eternal misery... misery you could have easily avoided.  Sinners will wish they had done just a little less evil so their punishment could be a little more tolerable. Pornographers will wish they hadn't made so many videos. Control freaks will wish they hadn't been so angry and abusive. The internet troll will wish he hadn't cursed and slung so many demeaning insults toward a stranger online. And the abortionist will wish they hadn't killed any pre-born infants. All sins will be exposed. There's no way out... unless...  Unless you accept Christ as your Savior. Confess that you're a sinner, repent of your sins and accept His free gift of salvation and grace. It's all yours... free for the taking! Jesus is the only way to get out of what's coming soon upon this world. I know you've probably heard ""Jesus loves you"" a million times in your life, and it probably sounds like an empty mantra by now... but it really is the truth! Do you know why you exist? Have you ever stopped and pondered about that...? Nothing in this life comes to be without God's approval first. That means that God thought  you were so worth the effort that He created you!  Or maybe you're wondering, ""How do I know that only Jesus can save me? What about Islam? Or what about Hinduism or Buddhism? How do I know that the Bible isn't a book of fiction and myths? In fact, what about all the starving kids in Africa? If God is so ""just and loving,"" explain that one!"" These are incredibly valid questions that deserve real answers. In fact, how can you even know God is real to begin with?  If you have deep questions related to God, or if you're just remotely curious about Him... I encourage you to search out these authors. I'll even list some of their books that address just about any issue or question you could have about God:  Frank Turek- ""Stealing From God: Why Atheists Need God to Make Their Case""  Andreas Kostenberger- ""Truth Matters""  Louis Markos- ""Apologetics for the 21st Century""  Norman L. Geisler- ""When Skeptics Ask,"" ""I Don't Have Enough Faith To Be An Atheist""  C.S. Lewis- ""Mere Christianity""  Lee Strobel- ""The Case For Christ,"" ""The Case For A Creator,"" ""The Case For Grace""  Ravi Zacharias- ""The End of Reason,"" ""Jesus Among Other Gods,"" ""Can Man Live Without God?"" ""Why Suffering?""  Philip Yancey- ""Reaching For The Invisible God,"" ""Disappointment With God""  Also, the ""One Minute Apologist"" right here on YouTube offers quick videos that tackle tough questions about God.  **  Why am I telling you all this? Especially when this has absolutely nothing to do with the video you're watching? Simple: to warn you. To offer you a life line. Deep down, if you have discernment and common sense, you can tell something is dreadfully wrong with this world and something in your heart is telling you to get right with God before it's too late. Don't ignore that voice! Listen to it, no matter how small it is. I'm just a beggar telling other beggars where they can go to find the Bread of Life.  Don't let anything stop you from finding God. To quote Erwin Lutzer: ""Standing at the Great White Throne Judgment will be hordes from every country of the world, from every religion in the world, with the best intentions in the world. They will learn too late that God is serious about justice, and if Christ does not bear their punishment, they must bear their own.""  Don't lose your life! Let Christ save you while there's still time.",7년 전,0,

If its true that Rian Jonson wrote the story I think he got a box of bits other directors had filmed & he wrote a story to fit all the pieces together, just like Ed Wood. it would explain why there was such differing tone & quality to Last Jedi. the clone wars animated series felt like a Star Wars movie, as did Star Wars Rebels, even Star Wars Lego Freemaker Chronicles felt more like Star Wars than Last Jedi.",7년 전,0,

@PowerPackers90,"Thats not why most people didnt like the movie. It was poorly written and made zero logic. pointless plotlines, trolled the viewers, had way to many meta jokes during serious moment, and completely miss the mark about what they are trying to say. Disney/Johnson ""It's about moving on and letting go of the past"" and yet ends with the bad guy wanting to do just that, and the heroes being a rag tag rebelling underdog with one Jedi rookie fighting against an evil Empire.",7년 전,1,
@Vemenac,"What? ""SW-series best character development scenes yet"" ... there was no development for any of the characters whatsoever. Rey didnt grow like a character, she didnt event train, she didt have the time to do so. She just got incredibly powerfull in like 2 days for no reason and went off to defeat (again) Kylo, who is trained since his childhood.  And dont get me strated on Kylo. At the end of TFA it was said Snoke will compete his training, hinted that he will be more stable and powerfull. What did TLJ do? Snoke ridiculed him and Kylo was even more of a unstable crybaby than in the previous movie. That missed potential, to make him into something really scary and antagonizing, made me so mad.  No development for Finn even though he was in whole segment of a movie, who was kinda a major character in TFA. I dont mind it tho, dont think he has much more to offer than being a needed hero.  Development of Snoke? Such an awesome villain. Allmighty and according to the visual dictionary not even sith, witch makes it even better imo. Killed off. Why. Ray and Kylo joining hands against him would be such a good plot for the final episode, for us never seeing anything like that before. I just hope they make it he transferred his consciousness into another body (like powerfull forceusers do)  Only development i saw there was Luke, who from a horrible caricature of his former self went to a normal him and Poe, who got schooled and they used whole fcking halp of movie to do so. The casino part had no other reason than to learn Poe a lesson.   omg i just wrote an essay JUST on missing character development. It wasnt even a good star wars movie (and the bar there is pretty low you know), let alone a good movie overall",7년 전(수정됨),1,
@FlowerofDissolution,"@Grundy or should that be Grumpy? Sad to see that you didn't like TLJ, but that's life. I loved it and will go back to watching it for years to come. Better luck with the next one for you.",7년 전,1,
@Bjasileus,just a question not to be rude but how? How can people like it with alt that grundy pointed out and more? I mean i get that JJ screwed up Rey and Rian really couldn't fix that but atleast try to get a backstory that makes sense. It doesn't even make sense if you only look at TFA and TLJ as we see Rey be hold by portion-guy in while she got dropped off. I hope JJ atleast fixes this trilogy so it makes sense when just looking at them and not the other 6 but goddam. Any ways sorry for storming off and sorry if I sounded rude. TLDR: how can you overlook the mistakes(maybe you dont think they are mistakes) in TLJ? Just curious.,7년 전,1,
@Bjasileus,FlowerofDissolution so you don't mind Rey being more powerful than force-jesus(anakin) and the reason being something that if true breaks the lore and meaning of the star wars universe?,7년 전,1,
@Bjasileus,"FlowerofDissolution we know rey is more powerful than anakin since she has no training and then does a mindtrick and wins a lightsaber fight with no training. Luke only won one lightsaber fight and that was after Yoda said he had learned enough, aka he was a jedi knight. Kylo is trained by Luke so he must have training in lightsaber dueling and he uses the dark side which means his wound makes him more powerful not less(thats why he pounds on the wound). A lightsaber is way less heavy than Reys staff and the only thing that should translate is tactics which means she should have lost. Her then lifting rocks in tlj and not having any problems with it shows that she is not thoughtout as that should feel hard, I mean did you look at Yoda in the PT? He has a hard time just lifting one pillar while she lifts like 20 big fuckin boulders. Anakin the most powerful force user to ever be born only gets to her level after 10 years of training. This is continuity problems.",7년 전,1,
@Bjasileus,FlowerofDissolution you made me not hate tlj as much anymore. I am actually looking forward to IX now. Thank you. I still see tlj as the worst ST part but maybe Rey will still have a backstory.,7년 전,1,
@Bjasileus,"I just got a head canon that fixes everything. So basicly after The OT a lot of Jedi knowledge has gotten lost and luke hasn't finished his training yet. Darth Vader was toying with Luke through the entire OT(also when he cut his hand off). Now luke finishes his training somewhere between RotJ and tfa, not in between ESB and RotJ. Kylo never actually got far in the Jedi training program because he had power but was too emotionally conflicted (probably because han disagreed with the desicion and Han and Leia broke up after this(this is also what Luke means by Han being Han about it)) Snoke slowly corrupts Kylos mind through this Conflict and we end up with a fairly trained but still beatable Kylo Ren and the pt, ot and st fit together. (Now we just need to know why Rey is so Powerfull). (with TCW in mind, that explains broomboy btw.",7년 전,1,
@FlowerofDissolution,"Excellent thinking. It does make sense looking at it like that. I also think we are still in for several surprises as to Rey's character (and don't forget Finn!), along with what will happen with the First Order and Kylo Ren in IX. But I try to not think too much about it. I'd rather be surprised. Also, I'm glad you now can see something in TLJ. ;) In the end, we all have our favorites and preferences in storytelling. If I had been 12 when watching The Phantom Menace I am absolutely sure I would have loved it. But by then I had already seen a ton of sci-fi and was all grown up, it just didn't work for me. And it's likely the reason why TLJ seem ""fresh"" to me as well, it resonates with other sci-fi fiction I know while bringing in some new ideas to the scene.",7년 전,1,
@FlowerofDissolution,"Personally, I watched all movies with a kind of tabula rasa-mindset, not really expecting anything from them, but just taking them as they are. I do that with all movies, not watching trailers, reading reviews etc. From that, I only openly disliked Episode I, while I liked/loved the rest while also found them to be flawed in various degrees. I didn't find the experience to be different with TLJ. I didn't expect something perfect nor do I need that for loving a movie or any kind of media actually.  From the heated comments I've seen, I honestly think this is mostly about what attitude people bring to the movie. It took so many years between the ending of SW6 and the continuation of this story, that some people have already made up their minds of what they want and expect from SW. Some people are huge fans on Luke as a character. While I wanted a bigger emotional impact during those last scenes too, I didn't really mind that his character was essentially that of Yoda or Obi-Wan Kenobi in the movie. He's a side character and a new generation of characters has taken over center stage. I’m fine with that.  I don't mind because I do find Rey to be an interesting character, along with Kylo Ren. Especially their relationship and the ways that they both reach out and pull back from each other gives TLJ a very different vibe to it than previous SW-movies. I never thought JJ screwed up Rey. She was just as shallow as a character as Luke was in the beginning, in their respective first movies, but still very endearing, like him. Rey only got her own motivations for fighting thanks to Rian’s TLJ, but this is just as it was with Luke in his second movie. That’s part of what I loved about TLJ and ESB.   In the end, don't expect too much from this franchise. It was always silly that Darth Vader could kill the emperor the way he did at the end of SW6. Or bizarre that Palpatine became a raisin from using too much Force, as an explanation for the Emperor’s looks. You always had to overlook things, plot holes, lack of character development (like Luke’s lack thereof during SW4-6, he remained naively idealistic from beginning to end).   I think these new movies do a good job in keeping the good part of the movie predecessors while carving out its own thing. So, to appreciate what’s fresh and new I suggest keeping expectations realistic or actively not imposing one’s own ideas on where the story should go. You might have a better experience watching the last movie that way.",7년 전,0,
@FlowerofDissolution,"Bjarke Arvelund I don’t know why people say Rey is more powerful than Anakin. Clearly, she is not. The answer is probably that Kylo Ren isn’t that strong as a Force user as you might assume. He’s actually quite young, as has been pointed out in some good analysis by both Rian, JJ and Adam Driver on the development of his character. They openly talk about the encounter with Rey in TFA as being his first lightsaber battle against another lightsaber user. In TFA he’s also got a nasty wound in the gut, so he’s not even at full fighting capacity during that encounter.   This makes Rey having a chance make sense, even in TFA. Mostly this is because she’s clearly an adept melee fighter long before TFA starts off, which is demonstrated throughout the movie and commented upon by JJ, Rian, Driver, and Daisy Ridley as well. It didn’t make much sense for Luke to be able to handle a lightsaber either, but if you accept that, you’ll have to extend that acceptance to Rey being able to use the Force as guidance during her fights as well. At least Rey had melee battle experience, which Luke didn’t seem to have initially.  Therefore I wouldn’t draw the conclusion that she’s more powerful than Vader or even Kylo Ren. She’s just up to the task. Which was also the case with Luke being a novice who eventually got more skilled. I don’t want to post spoilers but neither Kylo Ren nor Rey seems stronger than Snoke in TLJ, which is why things go down the way they do in the movie, making for a quite plausible development. Where that puts the characters in the coming movie we still don’t know.",7년 전,0,
@FlowerofDissolution,"Bjarke Arvedlund Some good points there, especially about Ben and Luke probably having done some kind of lightsaber training against each other because that just makes sense. I think the point the directors and cast members were making is that while Yoda, Kenobi and Anakin, all the Jedi from that period, had extensive training in both the Force and lightsaber battles, the following generation of Luke, and now Kylo Ren and Rey, never really got that.   The OT never showed us much about Luke’s training. Considering Yoda’s age and (dying) condition it’s hard to think they could’ve trained with lightsabers against each other. Nor do we know how long the training took. It could have been days, weeks, or perhaps longer. Who knows? But the pacing of the movie is pretty fast, so I always assumed it was a month tops, because no one shows signs of aging during Luke’s absence. In ESB it appears as if after spending “some” time with Yoda doing Jedi stuff we don’t know much about, Luke quickly finished his training but were not “emotionally ready” to face Vader. In SW6 he doesn’t come across as more powerful or more trained, just more mature and focused applying his knowledge. In TLJ though, he’s clearly stronger with the Force, which makes some sense considering his age.  The contingency problem is essentially a problem created by Episodes 1-3. While the OT made it possible to become a Jedi fast, as long as you had the right aptitude for it, suddenly the prequels made Jedi training exceedingly difficult and something you had to initiate in childhood or fail miserably at. I think these new movies essentially take us back to the OT’s view on the matter, intentionally ignoring the PT. At least, hardcore training from childhood doesn’t seem to be required in becoming a Jedi, just “more skilled” at it.   So about Rey, she may or may not have trained with swords or we could just assume we don’t know those details about her past, just as we aren’t shown Luke training Ben in lightsaber battles. But it’s not that important considering the OT never was realistic, to begin with on this matter. The same can be said about those stones. So we don’t get an exact repeat of ESB and Yoda’s training regimen in TLJ, but that doesn’t mean Rey hasn’t trained doing those things. Again, it all comes down to what assumptions we make here. SW isn’t very forthcoming regarding how the Force supposedly works or what it actually means to be “powerful” with the Force.   Personally, I don’t think it matters for the appreciation of the movies. The notion that the most “powerful” Force user wins is childish at best. No matter how powerful you are, there may always be circumstances that have a bigger impact on the actions in the moment, which may create an opening for the underdog. You’ll have to accept that if you accept the Emperor’s death in SW6. But, it’s also common sense. It certainly made TLJ enjoyable for me, exactly because there is this possibility. And I’m hoping we’ll see more of that in SW9: a pretty level playing field with not equal combatants, but possibilities for both parties to succeed, leaving us wanting to know the ending.",7년 전,0,

@FlowerofDissolution,"@PowerPackers90 Somehow I don't think you don't speak for ""most people"". I'm not even sure I saw the same movie as you. Because TLJ I saw had the SW-series best character development scenes yet, the most interesting on-look of the Force I've encountered thus far, giving us much needed depth and nuance to the franchise. Finally we see some core concepts freshened up after having gone stale and repetitive over the years, such as what it means to be ""good"" or ""evil"".   Considering how alike TLJ is to the Empire Strikes Back regarding the plot, or shortcomings thereof, I don't know where those complaints are coming from. So what if there isn't much going on besides the Rebel Forces fleeing and our Jedi hero training and then getting tied up in her relationship with the main protagonist, Kylo Ren (much like in ESB).  For the coming movie, the Rey-Kylo Ren relationship simply had to develop further than Rey going after Kylo Ren because he's ""bad"". Now, finally, she has her own motivations for actually being in the story at all. That's pretty major.",7년 전,1,

@internetperson5445,Hi Danny Gonzalez,4년 전,1,
@jesusfollowerswomenministries,"Only Jesus is the only way to Heaven, all other ways outside of Christ leads to hell. That's the truth that will never change. John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him I Am the Way the Truth and the Life no man cometh unto the Father but by me. Only Jesus is God and is the only one who can save us from hell and from sin, He's the only one who went to the cross for us and paid for our sin debt and God rose Him on the third day and is alive forever more and only God can do all this and no other never can and never did nor will do as God did and does. Know also because of what Jesus did we can saved, redeemed, forgiven, justified, purified, sanctified and reconciled to God our Heavenly Father and creator and get filled with His Holy Spirit. God offers forgiveness to anyone and everyone who will believe and trust in Jesus Christ for salvation and repent of their sins. This includes those involved in any sin. Once salvation through Christ is received, God will begin the process of destroying the acts of the flesh (Galatians 5:19-21) and developing the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23). Sometimes God removes our desire for a particular sin and other times He gives us strength to resist temptation. The process of transformation takes a lifetime. When we fail, God is faithful to forgive and cleanse (1 John 1:9). He is also faithful to complete His work in us (Philippians 1:6). The promise of a ""new creation"" is available to anyone who will trust in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17). When Jesus saves us our past is gone our sins are washed away by his precious blood and we new creations in Christ Jesus📖🕊2 Corinthians 5:17-18 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; God bless and I pray God will reveal Himself to you all and you all will experience Jesus true love true salvation true Holy Spirit true goodness true truth and go Him and get saved Amen",4년 전,1,

Instead of asking everyone what they think of him they know it's him because when he goes to the vending machine he uses the force to get a free snack and soda. Sending the officer (as simpathy) to question a captured rebel who turns out to just be the pizza boy who showed up 1 minute late. Subtle stuff that doesn't treat the viewer like a moron. SNL in the 70's had the Bass'o'matic. We knew it was a blender without being told. SNL now would make a point about it being one instead. In the end what SNL needs is better writters. They have a decent cast, but they can't shine if the script is lacking.",7년 전(수정됨),1,

J J abrams directing etc. Remember that there is hating on a new thing for no reason and there is hating on the new thing with good reasons. I have some good things why i did not like force awakens.",8년 전,1,
@deniz1139,Adrian SH for now I also don't like the force awakens but I'm a bit cautious with my judgement solely for the fact that the trilogy isn't done yet. no one judges a new hope as a stand alone film. BUT I will add this; if the follow up movies are just as bad as the force awakens then that jar jar abrams cockskin can get right to fuck.  as for the point of hating the new for the right or wrong reasons; I like the fighting choreography a lot more in the prequels than I liked them in the originals there I said it sue me,8년 전,1,
@CatMaster90001,"4reptar20 Same here with Revenge of the Sith, actually. It is the only remotely good movie out of all the prequels, even if there are some very Lucas-esque mistakes in it. The important thing is that the good actually outweighs the bad, which is surprising, considering Episodes I and II were absolute fucking atrocities.  And yes, I TOTALLY hear you on the TFA hate. It's entirely unjustified and absolutely irrational. TFA is actually my second-favorite Star Wars movie, with Episode V still maintaining the top spot.  You also make some totally solid points with the DVD edits. There are some of them that I actually think are justified and logical, such as replacing Clive Revill's Emperor with Ian McDiarmid's Emperor, purely for continuity within the original trilogy itself. That, and replacing Yub Nub with Victory Celebration at the end of Episode VI actually made the victory of the Rebellion feel truly genuine and emotional. But then there's the multitude of nightmarishly horrendous edits, such as the hideous and distracting CGI, like you mentioned, as well as those pointless extra rocks in front of R2, replacing Boba Fett's voice to match with Jango, badly photoshopping Hayden Christensen's head onto Sebastian Shaw's Anakin ghost, making the sound effects so loud they drown out the classic John Williams score, making Vader shout ""NO!"" when overthrowing the Emperor, shoving that entirely pointless Jabba scene into Episode IV, and good fucking God HAN SHOT FIRST. NOT Greedo. I'll NEVER be over that.  Fear not about the theatrical editions though, my friend! Though I'm sad to say that Lucas' stubborn, cinematically incompetent ass will never give the theatrical original trilogy the remastered release it deserves (and yes, he really should have gotten the hint from Spielberg... though he never considered his concerns about including aliens in the fourth Indiana Jones movie), there's already a group of dedicated film restoration artists who have accomplished what was once deemed impossible over the course of years of recovery... They're called the Harmy Despecialized Editions. I highly recommend you look into them. You won't be disappointed.  Also, I wanted to say this earlier, but you bring up a very good point about the prequels fitting the original trilogy more. Another recommendation for you is Belated Media's short series of ""What if the Star Wars Prequels Were Good?"" This guy seriously has some genius ideas in store, and I'll give you a taste of what he has in mind: Instead of Naboo, it should be Alderaan.

The thing I never understood about the DVD edits, a lot of the changes were justified as changing the originals to fit the continuity after the prequels, right?

They Assassinated Queen Apailana who was Queen Padmé Amidala's successor, she was sheltering many Jedi after Order 66. Defeated Gizor Delso a Geonosian who was the sole survivor who somehow escaped when Vader was sent to wipe out the Seperatist Leaders. He attempted to recreate the CIS Army by using a Battle Droid Factory in the Mustafar system but failed and was terminated. Took the Cloning Facility  on Kamino and took out a breed of a New Clone Army to take Arms against the Empire but the 501st claimed the Facility with help from the Bounty Hunter Boba Fett.

He spent years of training and is probably pretty skilled in handling a bit of pain. I don't know why everyone feels like pretending that kylo Ren is a weakass when he is clearly not. He gets shot and has 2 sword duels. You try doing that. And even though Chewbacca for whatever reason just hit Rens side, it still must hurt like a bitch. From what I see he was shot in the hip area and he continues walking AND catches up with Finn and Rey. So he might not be a model and his hair is stupid and he talks to a molten helmet, but he is everything but weak. ",9년 전,3,

@xanatos8920,"+MrMarouka The tantrums are a great detail. Seems to be a lot of critics don't care for them. I thought they worked well, and even added some retrospective depth to Vader's journey.  Sith philosophy at its base: Channel feeling into raw power. They're a source of drive. Versus Jedi philosophy: Suppress feeling to focus on the task. They're a distraction.   While Kylo does the whole channeling-rage-into-strength thing quite often with his ""tantrums"", Vader was always very calm and reserved even while pissed off and killing. He didn't just unleash it into unbridled power (also note: He doesn't use lightning much, if at all), he kept it suppressed, pushed down, tempered...Like a Jedi. He never truly let go of his original teachings...That's what allowed his final redemption.   And it's what makes Kylo a much stronger user of the ""dark side"" - he's given completely to dark side philosophy (despite the pull of the light threatening this commitment). He's not even completed training by the film's end and he's holding blaster bolts in mid-air for several seconds and ripping thoughts straight out of peoples' heads. Beginner-Sith Anakin could never pull that stuff off.   I still find it sad that the film cut a dialogue included in the novel between Kylo and Snoke. It was a great exchange, all about how sentimentality was Vader's one weakness, that his ""redemption"" was the tragic mistake in an otherwise impressive life...Really adds weight to Kylo's conflict trying to break from the light side.",9년 전,0,
@xanatos8920,"+MarkiPewdSepticeye Kitty His disguised voice is all deep and menacing same as Vader's. And the suit looks intimidating... Same as Vader's. When they ripped Vader's mask away at the trilogy's end, he looked like a pitiful weakened nothing as much as Darth Ben (as I dub his unmasked self) looks like a pale dork.  And Vader doesn't look buff. He looks bulky. And that's because his suit wasn't built to look dark and frightening - it's primary a pile of life-support machinery, housing everything from breathing apparatuses to whole artificial limbs and all the circuits and mechanisms necessary to both. The intimidation factor is secondary to its life support purposes.",9년 전,0,

@MichaelB-Gaming,"I really don't get why people defend Kylo Ren (and General Hux, for that matter) so much. Sure, he has some inner conflict, but it's, at least to me, not of any interesting sort. I think he could become a good villain over the course of the next two movies, but as of yet, he is neither particularly menacing, nor actually fleshed out. Having him say stuff like ""I feel the pull to the light side"" is not good character writing. It's obvious. Have you ever heard Darth Vader, or even Anakin after he turned dark, talk aloud about his inner conflict? No? That's because it's mediocre writing. So stating out loud that he is conflicted in a way doesn't automatically make him a deep, well thought out villain. Then there are lots of contradictions about him in the movie. At first he seems like force prodigy, stopping laser shots in mid air and holding them there effortlessly for a long while, he can feel Han Solo when he is halfway across the planet but not when he's hiding in the same room as him, and then he all out loses a fight with a completely untrained Rey (Yeah, I know, gut shot from the uber-powerful bowcaster, but he could have just subdued her using his prodigal force abilities) by engaging in lightsaber combat, at which he is obviously pretty bad.  So, all in all, I think he has potential to become a good villain, but for me, he isn't one yet.   As for Hux, who so many people inexplicably love too, he was basically a Hitler Youth who has read Mein Kampf one too many times and tries to imitate his idol when giving speeches. He doesn't really seem like the kind of guy who is really able to command the First Order's armies and fleets.  It's kinda sad we didn't see basically anything from Captain Phasma. She seemed like she has a lot of potential to fill some kind of Boba Fett-like role for the First Order.",9년 전,4,

He is in a way like Anakin, but more convincing Anakin turned to the darkside for love for Padme. Ren turned to the darkside am not sure why, but in the entire film he feels as though he has to prove himself to everyone around him that he can be just as powerful as Darth Vador, but just doesn't know what to do anymore.

Everybody says that, but they seem to forget that they only know Vader from his middle-aged years, so the perspective that this is watered down from how Vader would do things is false, Anakin and Luke being whiney in their younger years proves the fact that there is a precedent for it. The fact we've never seen Vader settle in as a rookie also shows no one can actually say what Vader wouldn't have done at the same stage of his life. Anakin is a pretty unstable dude in the end.",9년 전,1,

To me that is one aspect of the Dark side that we don't think of so much. That deep down, oppressive people are scared and weak.",9년 전,1,
@AlexLarson7,"Paris Thompson What I meant when I said this was I watched TFA for a third time, right after I watched this. First time around I actually kind of liked the guy, seemed conflicted and all, even though he had temper tantrums like a child. But this time, after watching this, every time he came on screen I laughed. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Star Wars fan, and yes while I think the prequels are better, I still respect the other movies (except for Phantom Menace, the only good thing about that movie had about 15 minutes of screen time and was bisected). I actually thoroughly enjoyed TFA, although Ren did piss me off a little. I guess I compared him to Vader, who actually does seem like an angsty teenager next to one of the top 10 most threatening villains in cinematic history.

@gimliofdurin,"+Jesus Flores Dude, you're not making sense at all. If the national guard actually was protecting our borders, illegal immigration and the war on drugs wouldn't be an issue. Our borders would be sealed tight so nothing or very little would be coming through.    And don't invade countries for oil, that' another thing. Invasions tend to piss people off. Why is Iran an enemy? Because the US and UK funded a coup that kicked out a democratically elected leader who wanted to nationalize oil for a dictator who wouldn't (back than, British companies had control over the oil reserves of Iran). This helped support the Iranian revolution a couple decades letter. Why does Al-Qaeda exist? The US promoted jihad and funded the mujaheddin back when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan which soon after that became the breeding ground for Al-Qaeda. Plus the US left a bunch of weapons in Afghanistan after the Soviet Union was defeated which was not a good idea. Why does ISIS exist? The US decided to invade Iraq under the false pretense that the Iraqi regime had WMD and also supported the 9/11 attacks. This was all bull as they had no WMDs, they have one of the largest oil reserves in the world, and Bush wanted to finish what daddy started in the Gulf Wars. And we see the results from the most stupid foreign policy (the invasion of Iraq) in the past few decades. So basically, the US created the enemy it has been fighting for the last 14-15 years.   Fun fact: funny how the US had another goal with the invasion of Iraq which was to impose democracy on them. Well, back in the 80's did you know that the US actually supported the brutal Iraqi regime under Saddam Hussein who killed tens of thousands of people? This was because Iraq and Iran didn't really like each other back than and the US didn't like Iran because of the hostage crisis (which stemmed from the Iranian revolution which again stemmed from coup the US and UK supported).

You're lulled into a false sense of security because you haven't seen how bad some parts of the world are.  If the US disarmed tonight, nukes and all, tomorrow it would belong to someone else. Such a fat juicy target, that had only recently been so mistaken as to behave as some sort of world police, would not go untouched. Especially considering how many countries you're sanctioning right now for no reason but because you can, or for some illusory sense of dominance.  But you're civilians, so why should you care about protecting your way of life, right? That's someone else's problem, so long as you keep voting, right? Oh, what I'd give to live in such a simple peaceful world, where people won't take what they can from other people simply because they can.  Josh, the US military has an awful reputation.

@nutella_drifter,"I think this video totally backfires on the SW legacy. Kylo Ren is already a target of humiliating jokes and this approach just affirms the notion he is not a powerful, fearsome evil leader but a pathetic bad guy-wannabe with issues.

@BlustoyourRay,Oh relax and have a sense of humor. How many times has Vader been parodied in pop culture. It never took anything away from the movies.,9년 전,10,
@Ratraccoon,I think the behavior is intentional. Think about it there are people like this in real life and this is the first time in a movie that it was depicted in a villain in a non intentionally humorous way. I think it was brave of JJ and Lucas to do so. And Adam Driver could pull it off without making you laughing at it in every moment due to showing Kylo's emotional and mental instability. It is best to do the humor of this in parodies and not in the actual movies.,9년 전,4,
@Ratraccoon,+User Account  I do see him as powerful force user and Adam Driver played this complex character well but this fictional character's emotional issues do deserve to be made fun of due to how abnormal it is especially for a man his age.,9년 전,2,

Instead of a inter-racial romance between Fin and Rey, there should be a same sex inter-racial romance between Poe and Fin in which they get married and adopt a Ewok who is the victim of cyber-bullying.  It should be revealed that Kylo Ren was born the daughter of Han and Leia but has since self identified and lives as a male.  Rey needs to establish that she is actually fighting for gender equality in galaxy (as women only make 81% the wages of men in The First Order) and she Force chokes any and all white males she sees for their perpetuation of the galactic rape culture.  Chewbacca needs to take a stand against wookie discrimination (he was never given a medal for his actions in the destruction of the first Death Star) and needs to start a grass roots movement to allow free immigration to all star systems from his home planet of Kashyyyk.  Kylo Ren needs to declare an executive action that Storm Trooper armor will no longer be issued only in white, but will instead be issued in a spectrum of colors to be fully representative (though proponents of the black armor will demand a much greater issuance than only 13%). And, oh yeah, Luke has been missing for all this time because he figured out that instead of teaching Jedi, all he wants to do now is lay around and smoke (recently made legal in the galaxy) ""space grass"".",9년 전,0,

@WulfLovelace,"+MrSharkbait4 I don't get it either. I think Adam Driver perfectly portrayed a character slowly losing his mind. I loved watching the struggle and the portrayal of this character was amazing. I felt every moment of it, and even in that important scene on the catwalk. Rewatching it there are some details I noticed in the way Adam uses his voice to reflect the two sides of Kylo. Kylo isn't some emo whiny villain as so many people put him. He's clearly insane man, driven from emotional instability. And the more he becomes instable, the more I fear this villain. This is what they were never able to achieve with Anakin. I believe Kylo's descent into madness any time, and it's the first movie that really pushed this. He was clearly not a stable individual. At all.",9년 전,24,
@MrSharkbait4,"BOSS so.. we're ignore the fact that he was a completely undisciplined in that fight and had just had a gaping hole blown in him by chewbacca's blaster which as demonstrated earlier in the movie is very powerful, meanwhile although rey had just learned how to use the force she wasn't crippled with a wound and isn't totally helpless just because she unexperienced",9년 전,14,
@vanyadolly,+Finnisthemenace He did go out on his own terms trying to save his son. I can't think of what could be more heroic or touching than that.

@darkfu11,"+MrSharkbait4 the main reason seems to be from the way the characters acts: childish in ways. but i think that's what the film and abrams tried to convey in the film. he's still young and fairly new to the dark side.   i personally like kylo ren a lot. probably my favorite character right behind rey. i find him to be a complex villain, unlike many before. i'd even go so far as to say he's more complex than vader before the prequels covered his background.",9년 전,12,
@NellSmith,"+BOSS Rey's (eventual, and not easy!) victory shows that Rey is extremely powerful. It doesn't show that Kylo is weak. Far from it: he did, in fact, almost win the battle, despite being wounded (physically quite seriously, and mentally VERY seriously - he had just killed his own father, and was probably undergoing more conflicting emotions than most people could even cope with at all).  Until Rey finally remembered Maz's wise words about centring herself and concentrating on her Force powers, and despite making a brave attempt to overcome a superior (at first) opponent, she was actually losing badly to Kylo, who was, by that point, back in control of his emotions, more or less, and easily winning the duel - only refraining from forcing her over the ledge into the chasm because he could see that, perhaps, training her might help HIM to become more powerful. Otherwise, she'd have been gone right then!  Remember how Luke more or less flattened Vader, too, on what was only his second attempt at a decent, meaningful lightsaber fight with him? Even though Vader was ridiculously better-trained than Luke, was also a very strong Force-user, and had, indeed, been actively using his Force powers (and training with a lightsaber) for, oh, 30 years - up against a few weeks or so for Luke? Force-related contests of power and will - including lightsaber duels - aren't based on something as mundane as ""who has the most training"". It's not a simple fencing match...!  The Force can empower its users in many ways... it IS mysterious and changeable, and limitlessly powerful, and being ""trained"" is no substitute for (a) being exceptionally strong with the Force by nature, as Rey is, or (b) being in the right... as she also is, during her battle against Kylo.",9년 전,12,
@NellSmith,"+Finnisthemenace Han gave his life to save his son. There AIN'T no more ""badass"" than that. Shooting things doesn't come close.  And I think (after six viewings of the film, and counting...) that Kylo Ren is the single most interesting, complex and frankly ""different"" character in the entire film. How to ""top"" Darth Vader - not only Star Wars' best villain, but the best villain in movie history - without trying (and failing) to just copy him? Go in a totally different direction - and a very unexpected one, too.  What is more, Adam Driver does a fantastic job of portraying a troubled, conflicted young man who is fighting all the time for what HE truly believes in - and against, as he puts it, ""the pull to the Light"", which is, to him, a constant suffering (remember his line to Han: ""I want to be free of this pain""...  He's NOT meant to be a mature, trained, experienced, confident Dark Side ""expert"" like Vader. He may become that... but finding out whether he does - and if so, how he does it - will be one of the best parts of the next film, for me.  Returning to Han: he's done endless shoot-outs and thrown countless cool one-liners around, and there can be nothing original left for him to do in the way of impressive Falcon-flying feats. Instead of just giving us ""more of the same"", when it came to his (inevitable) death, the way he went out - showing a completely different, and actually far more genuinely likeable, touchingly emotional side of his nature - was both moving (I cried!) and also a true memorial to a great hero... who, as everyone is saying, we all KNEW was going to die anyway.  And hasn't anyone also realised that, by his self-sacrifice, Han inspired Rey to finally overcome Kylo? Just as Obi-Wan sacrificed himself in order to - both metaphorically and literally - hand over power to Luke? That was not an accidental parallel... and I, for one, thought it worked really well. Just as Obi-Wan's time was over, so was Han's - and yet, in death, he TOO did indeed become ""more powerful than (Kylo) could possibly imagine"".  There is so much more to Kylo Ren than people are noticing. The oh-so-funny jokes that ""He's just an Emo with temper issues who hates his Dad"" are getting old - and are obviously made by highly superficial people, who aren't capable of noticing deep emotion or appreciating fine points of meaning.  Many congratulations to Adam Driver... both for (in my view) playing a truly frightening villain with immense power and potential (albeit sometimes uncontrolled - maybe only for now, maybe forever?) - and ALSO for having the humility and self-deprecation to appear in this parody, with such obvious good humour, and to make a great job of that, too!  Great performances from all concerned, in fact. Love it :D",9년 전,10,
@NellSmith,"+Jene Clyde Very interesting analysis, and I certainly agree that Adam Driver portrayed the subtle nuances of changes in Kylo Ren's voice, body language and expression - reflecting inner conflict and turmoil not expressed by overt words or actions - absolutely brilliantly.  I, too, cannot understand why there are so many ""whiny Emo"" comments about a villain who is, as you say, genuinely frightening. He is already extremely powerful - the ease with which he uses the Force to, for example, read the minds of very mentally strong characters, or to respond instantly to threats such as Poe's blaster shot, is more than impressive in a Dark Side user who is not even fully trained yet! - so I, like you, am much looking forward to seeing Kylo's progression in the next Episode. In fact, it's probably the most interesting element of the next film, for me.  Now, I grew up with Star Wars as my most iconic influence in the world of cinema, and I will always find Darth Vader to be the very epitome of a polished, perfect villain. But Kylo Ren is NOT meant to be that... quite the opposite! He has massive potential... but the direction he will take is left wide open, and I, for one, am intrigued.  The only disagreement I have with your excellent observations would be to say that I don't believe that Kylo Ren is actually insane. I see that he is deeply troubled, of course, and heavily conflicted: he WANTS to follow Vader's Dark path, yet he is drawn inexorably to the Light. He believes in the Dark Side in a deeply spiritual way (he's not just killing people to amuse himself, like some corny third-rate gangster!)... and yet he *also"", as Lor San Tekka so wisely pointed out, cannot fully deny the Light Side heritage into which he was born.  I believe he is not so much insane as (again, as you mention), dangerously unstable. His outbursts of rage are primeval and exhibit uncontrolled power; and yet he is also capable of great self-control, to the point of being almost wholly emotionless... and it is difficult to say which of these two sides of his nature is the more frightening! Insanity is typically random: Kylo's emotional outbursts are powerful, yes, but always triggered (or otherwise derived from a specific cause). Not quite the same...?  Still, again, thank you for a very perceptive and shrewd analysis of a character who is, to me, as fascinating as Rey - if not slightly more so (unless, of course, Rey's future holds rather more surprises than it would seem... ;) )",9년 전,8,

@Bya388,"Jene Clyde  I wholeheartedly agree. It seems like they borrow quite a bit from Jacen Solo from the EU in that regards. Someone who is conflicted and in turn teeters on the brink of sanity, but still clings to the light. It is only when he makes his choice where there is no turning back. For Jacen it was killing Mara Jade Skywalker. In this case, it was his father, Han Solo.  Overall, while I enjoy Kylo Ren, I do think Jacen so far was much better of a character. But I admit he had a series of books and we saw him grow and develop as a character. Especially, with his Twin Jania. If LucasFilms is going the route of Legacy of the Force with these movies, then I see Rey(she's most likely a Skywalker) being the person who will reflect the positive side of the Skywalker, instead of the dark.  If that's the case, then I am fine with it. Though, a part of me will still be saddened they didn't even just use those character names. Oh, well. Overall, great analysis.",9년 전,1,

@Bya388,"+NaokoTheDragonKnight I agree about Solo being overrated. I like Harrison Ford's portrayal, but he's so overrated. It is usually amongst the casual fans we see this.  To be fair, I know Solo got development in the EU(I know its legends, but I prefer calling it the EU) and it was good.  If anything, there are a lot better characters in my view. For instance, Mission Vao from KOTOR in my view is a much better character. She fulfills the Smuggler archetype, but rather than  wanting money or paying back debts, she wanted(SPOILERS) to find her brother.   She was also hardened, but a bit wide-eyed given she barely left her planet.   I know that is one example. Hence, why in my view a Han Solo movie is very much an attempt to pander at the OT purists/casual fans out there. I understand from a business perspective that is smart, but I do not think we need it. If anything, make an Obi-wan Anthology film. He's such an important character within the mythos and there have been great stories told about his life on Tattoine.    But I guess I am in the minority.",9년 전,0,

@Bya388,"Jene Clyde That's what I figured. We will see more of Ren in Episode Eight. I'll be honest, I enjoyed Episode Seven, but I do think it is overrated a bit. The lack of explanation of the world(and this is someone who has kept up with almost everything of the new canon), rushed pacing of the third act and  being derivative of A New Hope, do hurt this film. But I enjoyed the new characters enough for me to overlook that.  While I do not mind if this new sequel trilogy follows the basic tenants of the OT( First one being a spectacle, second being the dark one, and the third being the grand finale),  I just do not want them to be beholden to the OT. I love the OT, but they should do their own thing.  That's one of the reasons why I loved the EU and respected the PT(despite being really bad movies).   But I have faith in Rian Johnson. Heck, I was looking more forward to eight than seven, because in my view, Johnson is a much better director than Abrams.  Check out Looper, and you'll see where we are getting at.

@TonberryQueen,"Bre Fujimoto Oh, I've checked it. But to be honest, while pain and suffering does empower those who use the dark side, we also still have to take into account that a wound is still a wound. As you can see, Kylo Ren was still schooling both Finn and Rey with the wound, but time and blood loss are still an enemy to someone with that kind of wound. Take also into account that Ren was too immature and not fully trained to understand the double-edged sword he was utilizing, and voila. Imo, if Ren hadn't been wounded, Finn and Rey wouldn't have left that forest alive.",9년 전,1,
@TonberryQueen,"Bre Fujimoto I do remember that. I think Rey has some serious potential. While I do think it speaks volumes about the amount of power she has, Still, I think it was mostly due to Ren being taken by surprise that she even had the force. And I still remember how Ren took both Finn and Rey while seriously wounded and inexperienced. In fact, both of them are very inexperienced, with Rey having no prior training and Kylo having some yet being very immature and torn in half by the light and dark. I just don't think it would have ended the same had Ren not been wounded. As for Rey being superpowered, I really don't think so. She was no more superpowered than any of the force sensitive important people before her. She was multi-talented. LOTS of people are. I think that foolishenss being spouted about her being a ""mary sue"" is made mostly by anti-feminists who are sick of the feminist bullshit they've been putting up with. And while I'm in that very same boat (I hate feminism), I don't find Rey's talents to be OP, if anything, they make perfect sense to me.

He says it immediately after Kylo Ren Force-throws him into a machine - a badass maneuver that's anything but sucky.   That's a direct shot a fans who say Kylo Ren is lame/weak despite the character displaying several feats of badassery in the film. Like freezing blaster bolts in midair and maintaining that control while having a damn conversation. No Force user has ever shown that kind of power. Or taking a direct hit from a Wookie crossbow like a boss (which sent other dudes flying), and proceeding to fight 2 people while severly bleeding out and mostly dominating.   But because he doesn't ""look tough"" (because Vader's shriveled up face was SO intimidating without the mask) and because some people confuse ""mentally unstable"" with ""emo"", he's a wimpy villian. sigh",9년 전,4,

@HansZarkovPhD,"***** Yes, you got me, I realize now that no mere mortal shall ever criticize anything ever with the words Star or Wars attached to it.  Actually the guys looks exactly like Penny's stupid boyfriend Zack from Big Bang Theory.  At least they didn't use any similar settings or plot devices from a New Hope and Return of the Jedi, made 30 years ago as pointed out in an earlier comment.  .  The story was completely original and taking the franchise in an entirely new direction.  I hate it when they recycle old plots, setting, characters, and vehicles and put it out as a new story.  I mean, I was getting tired of desert planets where an unknown worker finds a droid with important information and the empire types, led by a malformed guy in the shadows using a guy in a black mask with a red light saber to run his ground game to get the droid back is soooo cliche.  And the gag where a skywalker lightsaber is pulled out of a chest by an old character and given to said unknown worker from the desert planet has been done to death, so kudos to the screen play writers for not being lazy on that one.  And Solo leading a band on a ground assault to destroy a shield so a small rebel fleet can destroy a huge round super weapon that destroys planets.  That is soooo tiring and I'm glad they didn't go that way with the film.  Lets see, other tired plot devices NOT used in the new film:  Sending four stormtroopers to the planet to hunt down the info-droid despite having a fleet in orbit.  And then risking blowing the droid bombing it from the air.  Guy in black mask throws temper tantrum when he doesn't get his way.  Destroys equipment and kills people.  At least the freeze dried Thomas English muffins were something new and took a little imagination.  You guys enjoy spending the money and time on the next two sequels.  I'll keep my future movie money and just get a drink somewhere.   Episode 8   Let me guess, assaulting a rebel base on a frozen planet that scatters our heroes around a bit.  We meet mystery man a little more  who finds supposedly dead black mask guy and clones or somehow heals him in to a big life sustaining suit.  Orders robot black mask suit guy to track down and kill heroes and rebels.   Episode 9  Annoying Jedi chick learns the force from old master and goes on to epic lightsaber battle with a mysteriously resurrected guy in black mask while malformed guys watches and cackles, possibly touching himself under his robes during the fight.  Epic space battle between ragtag fleet that somehow wins the day against well funded and well trained, highly experienced military fleet.  Screen shot this boys and save it for a few years. You will call me a clairvoyant when it all comes to pass.",9년 전,0,

J.J. didn't have to prove shit to me. All I wanted was to see a meaningful story, some interesting planets, maybe seeing a reformed Jedi order that embraces positive emotions and a less corrupt republic with a bad ass military. Well he gave us Kylo... but honestly if they had just stuck to the (find skywalker plot) instead of Sharkjumper Base destory a goverment we knew nothing about and is brushed off as nothing (what was that... 8 trillion lives out of five highly populated planet's).

@WhiplashGames,"+Dalek Swartz I disagree.  Luke setup a new Jedi Academy, training a new generation of Jedi.  Frankly, it would be a piss poor Jedi school if he didn't teach his students how he was able to turn Darth Vader back to the light side.  What Luke did is an amazing propaganda win for the light side.   To be able to teach his students of the power of the light side. How even the darkest evil can ultimately be redeemed.  It's a huge victory for the light side.  I can't imagine how he would not have taught this to a new generation of Jedi.   I think Kylo Ren knows it, but just doesn't give a shit.   As Joe said, he looks up to Vader. Not Anakin. Hey may just consider Vader's turn to be a mistake, or even a weakness.  He may also have been told by Snoke that it's not true at all.  That Luke betrayed and killed Vader. (shades of Obi Wan telling Luke about his father in ep 4).      We have no idea how much control and indoctrination Snoke has done to Kylo Ren.   Including possibly tricking him into thinking he is in contact with Vader's spirit on some level. When really it's Snoke.",9년 전,8,

@Zhuntsai,+Zoey Anderson JJ Abrams talked about this.

@QuinlanLJ,"+Zoey Anderson He knows. That's why he killed his father, because that was supposed to be his only weakness, just as Darth Vader's weakness was Luke Skywalker.

@Tusc9969,"duderanch18237   Why didn't the movie explain what Abrams said  When did JJ say that would be explained?  Why didn't Luke tell Kylo about Anakin's redemption?  He may have. Kylo just may not have liked Luke's explanation and Snoke gave a better rendition of the story.  Why does Kylo see Vader as his hero?  Somehow he got the idea that the dark side was a better way of things with the force and he began to admire Darth Vader. But he also acknowledged Vader's failings. In Kylo's mind, Darth Vader should have killed Luke, but Vader gave into sentiment. That is why Kylo Ren had to kill Han Solo, to prove he could do what his grandfather couldn't. In my mind we won't be seeing Kylo Ren come back to the light. Maybe I am wrong, but how can you kill Han Solo and then come back? I just don't see it.  As for the resistance,  Did you read the opening scroll? The New Republic and the First Order are explained briefly in it. Also, we're not sure which Vader Kylo is talking to. Does he know about his grandfather's redemption? After all, Luke was the only surviving witness. Did Luke ever tell Leia and she in turn told Kylo. This is all part of how Ben was turned to the dark side and Again, I'm pretty sure it's something that episode VIII will focus on.",9년 전,0,

@WhiplashGames,"+Ahmed Faraz He's not supposed to be, that's the point. He's a poser. He's trying to portray himself as a ruthless badass, but underneath he is inseucre and unsure of himself. He has great power, but unrefined and lacking in control. Especially over his emotions.  This is the start of his character arc.  Both he and Rey are in the infancy of what their characters will eventually become.     And that is a cool way for them to do these movies, in my opinion.  Rather than just slap down another bad ass Vader type right from the start, we get complex characters with backstories that are not fully told, and we'll get to see them rise and grow and complete their character arcs to something different.     I don't understand why people hate this.. or just don't get it.  Frankly, the majority of people I see complaining about the movie.. about Kylo and Rey.. they just come off as angry, cynical hipster types. The ones who were never going to like the movie.

Snoke is Darth Plagueis after botched plastic surgery, which is why he was too embarrassed to reveal he was alive until now.  3. Luke has Midichlorian deficiency, meaning he's still healthy but can't use the Force anymore, which is why he exiled himself.  4. Han Solo is not dead, he cloned himself between films and transferred his consciousness into a younger body.      5. None of this is true (yet) :3",9년 전,0,

@shanedawsontv1420,"+Levi Ackerman I have a theory. You know who kylo said he was gonna finish what You started standing in front of aniken/ vaders scull?Maybe he meant aniken because he was the chosen one he was trying to bring order to the light and dark side. And to do that, you have to kill someone who means a lot to you. And when he killed Han, maybe leia and Han knew that he was trying to do this. ( bring the sides together ) so when kylo killed Han, he said "" will you help me?"" And Han isn't stupid enough to not realize that he was going to be killed. Han would have ran his ass off from kylo. Think about it.",9년 전,2,

@damianmakosa3529,"+Michael Tsoi So what if he beat Finn. In an earlier scene, Finn was fighting a nobody stormtrooper and he lost. Keep in mind that Finn had a lightsaber at the time and still failed to beat this stormtrooper. Unless you expect me to believe that Ren beating Finn, when a stormtrooper of no significance was able to do it, is an accomplishment, it is null.  Likewise, Chewbaccas gun is a difficult thing to value for me. In the original lore it was meant to be extremely powerful, but it was so powerful that only wookies had the strength to use it. Abrams seems to have thrown that entire narrative out the window as Han, an old man, has been able to use Chewbaccas weaponry with no qualms. Thus, I doubt the bowcaster is as strong as it used to be considered. The fact he was shot should play no part in it anyway as this was still a so called Sith Master that supposedly defeated all of his peers at once. The fight between Ren and Finn would be like a knight coming into battle against a peasant where both use a longsword. Even if the knight is unarmored, he still has the experience to completely destroy someone who has not used said weapon in their entire life. Now add on mental powers that allow the knight to move objects and it is even more ridiculous.   I see no reason to respect a Sith Lord that can not beat a stormtrooper that nearly died to another nobody stormtrooper and a slave girl. Luke, the son of one of one of the most force-sensitive humans to ever exist, still required 3 movies to become somewhat of a threat to Vader. That is why Vader was such a threat, we knew there was no one that could match him with Obi-Wan being dead. Ren just got his ass beat by a bunch of kids. Why can no;t Luke come out of hiding and force-slap this angsty teen into obedience?",9년 전,1,
@damianmakosa3529,"+Captain Spider-Man Perhaps you can honor me with the knowledge I seek about how Ren is a good villain worth being intimidated by if he got his ass handed to him by a slave girl who never used a lightsaber or the force? Like I said, If Ren is the leader of these ""Knights of Ren"" and he can't beat a girl who didn't even know she was force sensitive, I don't see what the threat is. Luke could probably smash all of them without even needing to use his lightsaber.",9년 전,1,
@damianmakosa3529,"+zeroangelmk1 See you're talking about things that separate a good villain from a mediocre one. Oftentimes, at that point, it's about the actor rather than the role. However, Ren isn't even at that point in his character. He still hasn't gone over the hurdle of being a threat in any way. Maul killed a Jedi Master. Dooku incapacitated Obi-Wan and Anakin. Vader killed Obi-Wan. The Emperor is just the Emperor. What has Ren done? The most intimidating thing he has done so far is...... Burn down a village of harmless civilians? Or is it the fact he tortured a couple characters? It's embarrassing that the storm trooper wielding the vibroblade that nearly killed Finn was more threatening to the plot at this point than Ren was.",9년 전,1,

@кяуртіс,Damian Makosa Pretty much. Everyone goes on about how he was such an amazing villain and yet completely palm all the others off that werent some of the favourites but were still complete bad asses.  It is a great movie but Abrams completely destroyed the lore of starwars for this movie. I mean hell there was already established cannon lore long before disney acquired the rights to star wars that showed han having 3 children one of which being the youngest turned to the dark side after both of his siblings were killed (going off memory). That would have made such a better movie instead of some pubescent kid having a long ass temper tantrum for what seemed to be the whole movie.,9년 전,0,
@damianmakosa3529,"+Paul If I recall correctly, you are talking about Jacen Solo. Yeah, do not get me wrong, there was a part of me that was happy the lore was gone. There were some very ridiculous things (superweapons like the Galaxy gun, world devastators, sun crusher) but a lot of the overall story was really great. I was hoping Abrams would have continued with the overall plot of the lore and focused on the rebels trying to reunite the galaxy with a major villain being the overall enemy in all 3 movies. Each movie could have had a new mini-boss so to speak (Thrawn for example).  But I guess Abrams was probably scared of making another Episode I so instead of taking a risk he took the safe, and boring, option of making a shittier Episode IV. The bummer is that people do not even know what they lost with the destruction of the lore.",9년 전,0,

It's hard to explain, but the legends lore after the Empire falls would be best served with a GOT system due to the amount of factions alive in the galaxy. You have cuts between a Moff plotting in their super-star destroyer flagship, a fight between two major fleets, maybe some infiltration or interrogation stuff, etc. This continues until the Republic finally unites the galaxy under one flag.

It was obviously about a slave's rise to politics, Jar Jar which mirrors Anakin journey to becoming a Jedi and ultimately a Sith. If Jar Jar hadn't ""met"" those two Jedi there would have been no war and wouldn't have risen through the ranks as a political advisor and become a key influence on the republic.

Either Ren is a pathetic villain with no reason to be feared as he got his ass beat in the first movie or Rey is an all-powerful protagonist that makes Luke seem like he was slacking throughout his training in the trilogy.    I don't find it believable that Ren could beat all of his jedi peers, lead a feared unit of Knights, and be considered the right hand of a Sith Lord yet still lose to a slave girl.

@LateNightHalo,"Damian Makosa well, straight off the bat, he's well acted which makes him better than EVERY sith from the prequels.. yes even better than Cristopher lee who was stiff as a brick under Lucas' mediocre directing.  Kylo Ren is a VERY clever take on the ""rip off"" villain.  The force awakens was clearly written as a homage to a new hope while setting up the future of the star wars universe so naturally many similarities pop up IE a death star, an evil force that wants to rule everything, a cloaked figure that leads it and his servant who wears a scary mask, black cloak and has a short temper.   NOW, while many studios will shamelessly make a darth vader clone and not do anything unique like what lucas did with Maul (just another guy with a cloak and lightsaber) JJ abrahms was clever and WROTE the character around the fact that he will always be in the shadow of Darth vader  No matter what kylo does, people will always compare him to Darth Vader and that angers him. he does everything! he wears a mask to seem scary like his grandfather yet underneath hes just a scared teenager who is being manipulated (and no, not in the stupid way that Anakin was manipulated, TRUE manipulation.) and we see it manifest itself in the way he constantly doubts himself and fears the lightside so much.   his emotional breakdown as he fought Rey was what cemented him as my favorite star wars villain... he is a REAL tragic character.

Yet we're to believe that Darth Vader purged of the Jedi Order? ",9년 전,0,
@damianmakosa3529,"+GEEKSoftheWEST Darth Vader didn't purge the Jedi Order. He went into the Jedi Temple and personally killed a bunch of younglings while leading the most elite battalion of clones against the rest. The Jedi Order was purged by the millions of clone troopers that betrayed the Jedi that put their trust in them. Second, it really doesn't matter that Rey ran away or if she barely beat him. She did beat him. This major threat that was built up in trailers and since the beginning of the movie got his ass beat by somebody with no training whatsoever. Imagine if Rey gets just a tiny bit of training on how to use her powers from Luke?    I just re-watched the fight between Vader and Luke, and if Luke hitting Vader off the ledge in the carbonation chamber is your best proof of hypocrisy, that's just embarrassing. For one, Vader was beating Luke's ass since before that moment and proceeded to utterly dominate him after. It's pretty easy to assume he let Luke ""win"" the duel at the top in order to go somewhere else in Cloud City where he would have a better advantage against Luke. When Luke goes into the new area to fight, the door gets locked behind him. Clearly Vader planned the fight there.",9년 전,0,
@watsit2yuh532,"Damian Makosa Oh jesus, Darth Vader was not beating his ass until the end we he backed him to the window. Hence his line, ""Impressive, most impressive."" It's embarrassing? Pretty easy to assume? Are you kidding me? This is obvious evidence whether or not you choose to accept it. Luke literally kicked him off the edge and we hear Darth Vader groan. He wasn't expecting it. Then Luke strikes him with a lightsaber on the shoulder, we here him moan out in pain again. That's clear evidence whether or not you choose to accept it. Darth Vader did kill all the Jedi after he acquired his suit. George Lucas confirms this.    For the love of Christ, she did not beat him, she overpowered him right before the ground broke. That's not ""beating him"" He had the upper hand throughout most of the fight. ""It really doesn't matter that Rey ran away or if she barely beat him."" Yes it does matter that she ran away and barely beat him. As I stated, she didn't beat him, the duel was interrupted. The match was a stalemate at best.  You're also clearly forgetting the fact that Rey was already combat efficient. Why do people assume that Rey was like poor little Luke with no training in Episode 4? On her home planet she had a reputation for being a bad ass warrior. Did you miss the staff she was carrying? I honestly feel like you missed all the details about how she survived on the desert planet.   So right now with the two at a stalemate, it's basically a toss up who would win.    ",9년 전,0,
@damianmakosa3529,"+GEEKSoftheWEST ""killing all the Jedi AFTER he acquired his suit"" is different from ""killing all jedi."" There were a handful of Jedi still alive once Vader was in his suit. The majority of the Jedi Purge deaths happened while Vader was still more human than cyborg. You may interpret the scene that way if you want, but I'm still holding to my interpretation. Either way, it really doesn't matter as Luke didn't win the fight, thus it's irrelevant how well he did. It doesn't matter how badly you beat an opponent in a duel, whether you win by a hair or by a mile, you outmatched him. If we go by your interpretation of the scene, Luke got one hit in on Vader.    lmao, you're acting like Ren should be commended for being able to just get a stalemate with Rey. This guy is supposed to be the face of the dark side, the biggest threat in the galaxy since Vader. Oh, and he also got beat by this girl who just got a lightsaber and realized she had the force. Her training prior to the fight with Ren is irrelevant, hence the reason I ignored it. Being able to use a staff, a sword, or anything else in the star wars universe does not equate to lightsaber training. People need to train for years in order to adequately use a lightsaber, and Ren got demolished by someone who never used one before. Just because you know how to use, say, a claymore, doesn't mean you know how to use a cutlass or a katana. This difference is even more extreme with a weapon that utilizes energy as a blade.    It's a stalemate, wow. I'm glad this threat to the galaxy has already been ""stalemated"" by the protagonist before she even had the chance to develop her powers in any sort of way. By the way, Rey not only was able to cut Ren with her lightsaber, but she had him on the ground when the planet was splitting. If you call having your opponent injured and on the ground while you're standing and preparing to move against him a draw, well I guess that's just your interpretation.",9년 전,0,

@ryankazzy3877,"Alright looks like I'm going to have to be the man of the chat, WHO CARES, all movies have flaws, especially star wars because people set such a high standard for it that no movie has EVER hit. the prequels were good because it was a political war for senator Palpatine to gain power and manipulate others(sorry hardcore fans but that's the truth) originals were good because they were the best visuals of that time, ep 7 was good because the visuals were stunning and the cliffhangers wooooo so many of em. drops the Mic",9년 전,6,

@ValpasKankaristo,"SpreadingtheMuse Wtf is your problem? People are saying they don't like the prequels. What is wrong with that? You want to know why people think they're bad?  1. Hayden Christensen - That guy's acting was hideous from time to time 2. Padmé's and Anakin's relationship - So forced, I have no idea why Padmé would fall in love with Anakin 3. Useless CGI - They could have very well used more practical effects.  4. Jar Jar - He was meant to be comic relief, but his humor is so dumb. He seriously steps in poop... 5. The overload of lightsabers - There are closer to 100 lightsabers in Attack of the Clones, and we see everybody swinging them all the time. Here's a massive arena of green and blue lightsabers. Here's a purple one. Here's one for Yoda. (Whatever happened to his teachings about Force...) 6. Fucking up the timeline - Almost everything cool from the originals was changed. Even ways of the Force. 7. The dialogue - It's simply not funny. There are couple decent wordplays in the whole trilogy, while most of the people actually loved the humor from the originals   There's a couple reasons for those so called ""cry babies"". ",9년 전,5,

@shockerfist4652,"+Valpas Kankaristo Well, the originals wouldn't have been TOTALLY understood if it weren't for the prequels, and, being neutral here, TFA wouldnt have been fully understood without originals. For example, when Obi Wan mentions the clone wars when he's talking to Luke in ANH, nobody knew wtf he was talking about, because the prequels were planned, and would be later released in the form of the PT. And of course, everyone knows how the OT relates to the new trilogy. But seriously though, you guys should stop fighting anyway. I really don't prefer a trilogy or care anyway, it's really the storyline that counts. Come on, you have to agree. Although prequels may have mistakes, storyline seemed pretty solid. Anakin is trained by Obi Wan, who we first met in ANH, and Anakin and Padme get married, against the Order's rules, Anakin fears losing Padme, Palpatine seduces him to the dark side, he goes rogue and Obi Wan slices the hell out of him, and Darth Vader is born, BOOM, OT begins roughly 25 years later.",9년 전,3,

@SpreadingtheMuse,"Valpas Kankaristo A good question which everyone should answer. Ill break it down: 1)  I'm a charter member, having seen the original in 1977 2)  I dug deep, researching what Lucas's influences were then seeking them out:  The John Carter of Mars books from the 1900s, the Lensmen stories from the 1930s (and serialized in the 1910s, its old stuff), reading previous versions of the ""Luke Starkiller"" script (there's stuff in there Lucas saved for TPM, proving TPM is more ""Star Wars"" than actually a lot of the original trilogy) 3)  I pay it forward. I use Star Wars for charity and philanthropy, building my own SW costume in 1978 and now donating my time in various capacities, representing SW and in that time and place being Star Wars to the people who see me  Now some of that has to be optional, as its not possible for everyone to have been alive in 1977.  But I'd recommend everyone read the sci fi from the 1930s.  Lucas did not invent the word ""Sith"" for example.  He appropriated it.",9년 전,0,

@gerunkwon2598,"Luke Lewis everyone would be pissed if they used touchscreens and new technology. The reason why sequels of old films uuck because they are not nostalgic enough. Nostalgia is the strategy that will make the movie great. Disney made the film good by making the old people jizz. If they used new technology everyone would be pissed and the old people won't jizz from the non-existent nostalgia and it would be awful. That's why they made TFA extremely similar to A New Hope Come on dude, this is an obvious marketing strategy. I can't believe you still haven't noticed this yet. Also it makes sense, because awful leaders like Pol Pol, ruined his country Cambodia by killing many of people and turning it to an agrarian society. Now that place is a run-down third world country. Think of the Star Wars galaxy as a third world country. It would be difficult to make new technology because an oppressive government.

@Eternalentropy,ShinyUmbreon01 Very long subject. If you really want to know then you should look into research from the following fields for better understanding as to what makes men and women tick. Evolutionary psychology and evolutionary biology. In general woman are attracted to status because with status usually comes money and resources. Men who have vast resources are the best mating partners because they can easily support the family which makes perfect sense and explains why you see gold digger mentality. It varies to degree's but all women value a man of status and money for this obvious evolutionary and existential reason. Nature isn't evil it just is. So when a women is attracted to a generally unattractive man most of the time it's because he has status and money.,9년 전,2,

@Eternalentropy,thryu You obviously didn't read my comments because your argument is full of straw manning and positions I never asserted. Just remember I am only parroting scientific research. It's not that fact I agree with the findings that you people have a problem with it's the fact that the findings seem to bother many of you on a deep level that you will criticize those who agree because no better scientific argument has been presented.   I openly asked and stated I am willing to change my positions and opinions if challenged and if the studies are sound and conclusions as well I would be willing to change but nobody has as of yet given me anything besides personal opinions devoid of scientific study and research. I refuse to base my world beliefs on opinions alone. I need evidence to support them.,9년 전,0,
@silvsilvsilv,"I just realized: we're not arguing if girls find him 'hot' (or attractive). It's pretty obvious they do, seeing these reactions. We're actually arguing why  they find him attractive, and if they would still find him attractive if he wasn't famous. ",9년 전,0,

@Eternalentropy,withlove312 So what scientific studies would you use to refute these positions?,9년 전,0,
@silvsilvsilv,"thryu I'd say it would be an interplay between personality, status, and looks. Sure, there would still be people attracted to him, but people wouldn't be obsessing over him like they do now.  I actually experienced something like this close up. About 7-8 years ago, I was in school with this kid. Kind of a geek, played in a band, nothing special to look at, never had a girlfriend, you know the type. Then about a year later he became the lead singer of a different band that was just starting to get known locally, and suddenly the girls were all over him. He was still the exact same kid, except he had a new status. ""Hot lead singer of popular band"" instead of ""band geek.""  ",9년 전,0,

@Eternalentropy,***** MRA websites? More like scientific journals done by professors in Ivy league universities. But I know your feminist friends don't like what science is providing to your ideology because it's not lending to the feminist narrative.   How can a scientific study and conclusion using proper methods of science and inquiry be insulting towards both sexes?  That makes no sense whatsoever. Science doesn't insult it simply give explanations. Fact is science doesn't always give the desired or easiest answer. It's hard to accept something that clashes with your personal world view but if you have nothing to back that view up with then your useless to the argument.  Your using all emotion and no reasoning. Keep your emotions out of science they have no place in it whatsoever. Also I must be a despicable human for believing the best and most concise theories to date in regards to these subjects.  Your line of thinking will advance humans nowhere because you will reject findings and ridicule those as you have me for believing well founded arguments. People like you make me sick. You are no different than the catholic church in the dark ages trying to hold the monopoly of truth by silencing people who want real answers and use the sciences to find them. You are the accuser of Galileo. You are the fascist that wants to stifle progress in understanding. You are the weak minded individual who cannot handle results. I feel really bad for your mind set.,9년 전,0,
@Eternalentropy,DejaVoodooDoll You say me but really you mean the work of others. Your issue is not with me but the work of scientists. I will look into the link and probably write back tomorrow. It is getting late here now.  Just remember I am only a messenger parroting scientific findings. If you don't like the findings then fine. I don't mind. I respect the people who actually take time to look at things deeply instead of simple articles actually dive into scientific journals and when they have if they disagree WONDERFUL! They did so not from ignorance but a position of understanding the other side of the story. That is all I can ask. I appreciate that you provided a counter argument with something science related so please gimme some time to digest this and I will kindly get back to you.

@silvsilvsilv,"Elida M I didn't even respond to the OP, I responded to the guy who perfectly described what people meant with ""weird hot."" And in my very first post I also correctly predicted that people would not want to admit it. 100+ reactions later: turns out I was right.  Sure, women are attracted to his (perceived) personality and humor, but that does not make someone ""hot."" I mean, there's plenty of fat and ugly, but brilliant, stand-up comics, who almost everyone will agree are very funny and great guys, but nobody would call them ""hot."" You can deny it all you want, it is a proven fact that women are more attracted to status over looks. Again, there is nothing wrong with that, it's just how we are programmed. It's obvious you are projecting your own insecurities on our argument to make yourself feel better. I also never said he wasn't famous before. In fact, I literally said ""before Star Wars they were obsessing over him in Girls.""",9년 전,0,
