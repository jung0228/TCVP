@12maples,"I was dying and my husband asked me if I wanted to see London or Paris. I told him I wanted to see The Price Is Right. My daughter came with me to the Mother's Day Show and there were only a few qualifying mothers in line. I thought I had a good chance of getting called down to play for prizes! That was until we were vetted over by the Producer who asked my daughter what was her university dissertation. My daughter then launched into a never ending title of scientific words that had no meaning to anyone present except herself.  My heart sank along with any chance of getting to shake Dew's hand on stage. Then it was my turn to speak and I told the Producer that when I watch the show my daughter tells me to stop shouting they can't hear me. The Producer said that they have always heard me. The smile on my face said it all, I was glowing over his words and gloating about my vindication about screaming at the tv. After getting home from LA, I got the biggest prize ever won on The Price Is Right, my life. Instead of giving up, I went to one more doctor who found and removed a tumor.

Even the ones who look like theyre thriving being that kind of person, they clearly are still constantly mad and upset and probably have no true close people whom they feel like get anything off their chest  Like clive is a PoS, but who really, at the earliest point in their life, would choose to be this way and have no genuine connections?  Like by the time they realize, if they ever, that maybe somethings wrong with their views and behaviour, they have pushed people away and surround themselves by ppl who keep them assholes. and so they stay assholes and even double down due to anger.

He's digging his own grave, of course, and being a dick while he doesn't need to, but that's because inside, he's deeply miserable because he knows his younger brother is better than him, on all fronts - life, career, travel, parental love... It may have started small. Maybe he didn't manage to get into college while his brother did, or something. That has caused him to be reasonably upset, which then grew into unreasonable hatred for every single one of his brother's successes. Now it's a vicious cycle, that he can't get out of, anymore.

@Original2c,"This clip is really fucking hard too watch, because its more real than yall think.  Clive is pretty much my 40 year old virgin brother who lives upstairs, works from home, is such a shut in he’s afraid to go to restaurants or the store because people will “judge his choices.”  Literally, he’s my brother only in dna. Wouldn’t piss on fire to put him out. Speaks down to everyone, acts like he’s got it all figured out, meanwhile he cant get a date, is built like the Pillsbury dough boy, and pops more fucking pills than a cancer patient.   The part that really hit home was the whole situation of the mom asking the younger son not to say anything.   Im not allowed to confront my brother about anything period. Eveytime anyone does he tries to make it go physical. I was about to suplex the fool onto some tile but my dad stopped me (we dont have the same dad). After that he tried to keep pressing me like he was finna do shit. Dad told him that he couldnt protect him from me forever, and if he didnt wisen up i was gonna kill him and end both our lives (he wasnt wrong, i hate that bitch).   After that dough boy ran up stares and downed a bunch of pills (not the first time he’s done the shit). He then called the abulance and told them what he did, waited for them to show up and take him to get his stomach pumped.   He’s done it like 7 or 8 times now, always for attention. He knows it guilt trips our mom into giving him empathy when he calls her from the nuthouse after they lock him up on “suicide watch.” (More like bitch made fat boy watch).  So now instead of him getting the short end of the stick i’m on a short leash and got a muzzle on me (despite being the only one with no mental health or police record out of all 3 of my mothers boys.   I get it, my parents just want the best life for me, they dont want my life getting fucked up over someone so useless and worthless, but at the same time, thats my mom. This is my family. This fools lucky our moms between us. If she werent around i already would have buried his ass 6 ft deep and pissed on the grave.   The real kicker, all my other siblings feel the same way.   My sister hosts almost all the family get togethers now. He’s not allowed to come, never invited.   Aside from our mom, effectively every bridge has been burned.   I get it, at the end of the day she still made him. Its still her son. I understand that, but it changes nothing for me, not after all he’s put us through.   If you find that you relate to clive in anyway shape or form, know thats a VERY bad thing. Id make changes, otherwise know that theres probably someone just like me, who wants equally terrible things for you as i do for my so called blood brother. And the difference is your version of me might not have a leash or a muzzle on him. Your version of me might just be biding his time and waiting for the right moment.   Make change, or make enough money to afford a coffin.",1년 전,4,

@kingofbudokai," @Samuelroberts34  Son, I don't know what kind of hell you've gone through that you ended up as delusional and bitter as you are, but you need to snap out of it. I'm sorry your experience has been so terrible, but you are most certainly wrong in your assumptions.  Human beings are MEANT to pair bond. Sleeping around with a bunch of different women is both extremely unnatural and extremely harmful to humans. It is quite literally the cause of all STDs, among other things. People often try to rationalize their lust with the ""we're just animals"" argument, but it's not even true. Humans are not animals in any sense other than the technical scientific classification (in that we do not fall under bacteria, mineral, or plant life, etc.) We have never BEEN animals. We did not evolve FROM animals. We are human beings with higher rational function than ""that girl is pretty I want to sex her."" We did not develop higher thinking over time, we have literally ALWAYS had it, from the first human ever to exist until now. To lower one's self to that of a morally reprobate beast is a crying shame, and not at all a pathway to real happiness. As much as this might surprise you, most men have never cheated, and most women haven't either. Loyalty is neither as rare or as difficult as you seem to believe.  Also, as a side note, ""Isn't a virgin"" is not the same thing as ""is a whore."" Personally yes, I do gravitate away from women who sleep around a lot, and I would never in my life date someone like that. But as a whole, women don't become useless or gross just because they aren't virgins. In an ideal world, yes, all non-married people, male and female alike, would be virgins, as that is objectively the most beneficial both to society as a whole (as evidenced by the fact that every single civilized nation in history has accelerated their collapse after embracing hedonism and sexual promiscuity, even more so when it is homosexual in nature just as a bonus fact) and to the physical well being of humans from a biological standpoint, but that doesn't mean everyone falling lower than the ideal standard is worthless.  Marriage is a wonderful thing. Commitment to one woman is infinitely more satisfying than an infinity of meaningless trysts, and I hope some day your eyes are opened to that truth.",11개월 전,0,

@stuartday1330,I take Peele more seriously in comedy than I do his directing some stupid horror movie subgenre of black horror. I can't really see how you can bring race into horror considering horrific things transcends race. It's basically just a virtue signaling attempt to be different when really all your doing is hiring black actors instead of white and being able to overtly interject race into the plot thus just turning it racist but since it's black people doing it then it's fine. It's very amateur. Socialist propagandists would be very disappointed.,2년 전,0,

The reason it took me so long to move out had 50% to do with money (college, then COVID & me going through jobs) and 50% me not being mentally ready.

Why do you think that about 50% of marriages end in divorce, and most romantic relationships that people get into fail?

That right there can set up the parameters of the sketch for older siblings.

@Cellobass324,"So many of y’all are misunderstanding Clive…  Clearly Clive is the good son here. Here are what we can gather from the skit:  (I think we can safely assume what is said by Clive is all true as none of the other family members disputed his claims)  The parents looks to be no more than 60 and maybe 65 tops here by appearance, which would make the sons about 37-45 age range. Let’s assume Clive is early 40s and his younger brother 37. This is reasonable as we know that Clive has been taking care of this parents for the past 15 years. Then, Clive must have started taking care of his parents when he was about 25-27, prime age to begin one’s career. Clearly, the parents are not ill and does not appear to have any physical or mental disabilities. The only other explanation is that the parents are financially irresponsible, could not hold a job, or perhaps lost everything due to some event that they never recovered from. Whatever it was, it happened when Clive was about 25-27 old. And the younger bro, instead of helping Clive help the parents, went traveling right after he graduated college at 21-22 and literally did not visit the parents, nor Clive the past 15 years, except for special occasions as the dad noted.  With all that said, I do not think it was a mere missive for Clive to call the younger bro a ‘prodigal son.’ I think the younger bro had a hand in this unknown unfortunate event that happened to their parents. I think the younger bro was the bad son growing up (e.g. got in trouble, irresponsible, etc.). And yet, as we know from the prodigal son story from the Bible, the younger son took his inheritance and ran away. I think it fits the narrative that the younger bro in this skit actually took large sum of money from the parents (and the parents willingly gave it to him) to the point that they could not financially support themselves.  Now, some may think that 15 years is way too long and does not make sense for Clive to physically be with his healthy parents for that long.   The most logical explanation is that the parents never really worked and do not know how to work. They came from a very wealthy family and lived off their inheritance. The parents had little to no real world experience and no concept of true value of money. Therefore, it was not hard for them to give all their wealth to the younger son (and the younger son probably had influenced the parents on this).  My guess is that Clive was the responsible older brother who went to college and maybe either had a great job or graduated from top business or law school at the average graduating age of 25-27 in those masters programs. He probably had a nice Wall Street or white shoe law firm job lined up. However, he had to drop everything after learning that the younger bro manipulated the parents to give away all their wealth to him and probably left the country. It must have been a surprise to Clive.  The parents only knew high standard of living, so they went into debt to keep up their standard of living, and their house was probably in arrears in taxes.  Clive had to take over the parents finances to save them from themselves. He had to take care all their paperwork, get a POA signed so that he could execute all the financial arrangements for the parents to keep the house and maintain their standard of living.  Clive, being a genius, was able to earn money while working from home (and this was before the pandemic!). He had to be super frugal to keep the expenses down. The reason he is eating microwaved pizza is because his years of frugality. Just look at his clothes. He does not wear expensive clothes. He is balding when his father and the younger bro have full locks of hair. Clive lost his hair due to years of stress of financially taking care of his parents (who do not have any marketable skill and are not willing to work minimum wage jobs) and decided that Rogaine is too expensive at one point and gave up trying to look good. He is probably working a ton of hours to the point that he has no social life.  Clive must have been so stressed supporting the parents’ expensive tastes. Clive must have tried to persuade his parents to cut down the expenses, but the parents did not listen. Anyone who has a financially irresponsible family member who they need to support can understand Clive’s frustration. Just look at the wine and the food and the clothes of the parents.  No. Clive is not a hater. Not a Reddit mod (he has no time for that). He once had a dream and ambition but gave up everything for his parents. Over the years he became jaded and resentful of his brother, who has turned his life around, is marrying a pretty girl and probably is independently wealthy (yet he cannot afford a first class seat for his older bro!!!).  One last observation. The ‘sloppy seconds’ comment indicates that this is the mom’s second marriage. The mom is likely someone who married wealthy men for their money and also married the father for his money as well. The mom also probably has no marketable skill and never worked her life, nor is she willing to.  Clive is the good guy.",3년 전(수정됨),1,

@VideosOfASoul,"This is actually the skit I think most about and reference most to help others understand how it's like living with one of my family members. I don't have a change to read this fully yet, but writing this here too to make sure I get a chance to read this later! So far, I think you have some good points, but I'm looking for how you would address whether these ""outbursts"" are justified and whether we can extrapolate that this is how he acts normally and if that is ""good"" (I would think such behavior is bad and causes stress to the other family members that may outweigh any other good he does).",3년 전,1,
@Cellobass324," @VideosOfASoul  To be clear (and I should have added to this in my original comment), his behavior is unacceptable toward his parents, nor good. He is probably broken and exhausted and jaded now. He should have taken care of himself a long time ago to let himself become like this.  We who know, being a caretaker to another can be exhausting and takes a heavy mental and emotional toll. If you don’t take care yourself, you will likely become angry, depressed, jaded, etc.  With this said, however, I think Key and Peele are too nuanced to sprinkle in these minor details in the skit unintentionally and just for comedic purpose. Just look at the movies that are made by Jordan Peele. They are full of nuanced details and Easter eggs. There are stories within stories. I doubt that these details in this skit were included without much thought.  It all fits together and surprisingly coherent in how the Clive character is now this mean and jaded person. It is actually quite sad if you take it all in.  I see this as another one of those genius Peele stories, albeit very short.  No detail is wasted and everything is there to tell a larger story.  I think this entire skit was inspired by the prodigal son story of the Bible and is the modern, and comedic take of it.  What would the prodigal son story look like today? What would the first meeting between the prodigal son and the righteous older brother look like with the parents around? Obviously my speculation of the backstory does fit perfectly with the Biblical story, but that is artistic freedom for ya.  In some ironic way, the righteous older brother has become the prodigal son: a jaded and broken man.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

@katherinemcintosh7247,"So…aside from being asked by my dad to be his best man (which would never have happened,) this skit perfectly exemplified my youngest uncle’s attitude toward everyone in our family, including his folks…we walked on eggshells around him when we were kids, didn’t want to set him off. He was always being a jerk. As adults, we realized that it was so sad to witness someone wasting their life and making sure everyone else was as miserable as he could make them.  Thank you for this skit. While we may understand that there are rare occasions which are actually unique, it is nice to see that one’s messed up uncle is not one of them…it is good to know one is not alone (and I am meaning one who has been verbally and emotionally abused by one almost the character portrayed by Jordan Peele in this sketch…GREAT JOB!👏👏👏",3년 전,2,

@angelc.9470,So I can relate to this me being the older brother being the black sheep of the family I was the fuck up to keep it simple. But I never let hate or jealousy make me like this.

I don’t want anything more than for him to be everything I wish I was and for him not to be everything I wish I wasn’t. Love you Joaquin💯❤️,3년 전,5,
@theforsaken4489,"People don’t understand, I actually feel his pain and frustration. He probably has the best heart and gets taken granted and advantage of. He probably loves his parents but they just treat him like furniture thus making him feel miserable and unappreciated to the point he doesn’t care anymore whilst his sibling can enjoy life scot free living the dream of what his brother probably always wanted to do and also knowing his brother is looking after his parents. He’s dug hisself so deep in a hole all he feels is resent and hatred. And all the negative comments on here are the problem of the world that haven’t got an idea on mental health and just judge without thinking to understand why people could be like that. People think it’s just black and white but it’s never black and white whatever’s going through someone’s mind. The world is fucked.",3년 전(수정됨),3,

After that I was married off in an arranged marriage to a Narcissistic man who strangled my career. By the time I divorced him, I had lost my career.. I lost my home, my possessions, everything. I had to come back to the same parents & living with them turned my hair gray in five years. I moved out & live alone, avoid everyone & everything. Developed C-PTSD & crippling insomnia. I don’t work. Brother looks down on me & tries to “help” me by throwing money at expensive “wellness” vacations that don’t really help me coz all I need is kind words now & then but he avoids talking to me. I don’t want his money. I just want compassion & respect. Mom helps me out with grocery bills & still is critical & smothering & it triggers me. Sometimes I think of going to God. It’s not a dignified life.",3년 전(수정됨),30,
@kevingedney3542,Goddamn I was just trying to make a joke. I am like a 50/50 Clive. Yall took my comment too seriously. The fact that I can see myself as that stupid asshole in this skit should prove it.  Life ain't that bad. Who really needs approval from anyone? Just be good to your family and friends.

@AnonYmous-ry2jn,"A lot of people get trapped in this situation and are pegged as the family loser, but the hidden truth is that people living with their parents deep into adulthood have often suffered abusive and narcissistic parenting, doing more to trap and undermine the so-called ""failure to launch"" adult child than help him or her get out of that situation. And the biological (as in ""evolutionary biology"") aspect is that parents will often pour disproportionate resources to one (usually the oldest boy, and as to girls, the prettiest one) to maximize success in at least one child. The less-invested-in child is forced to play a support role (becoming the ""maiden aunt"" or ""weird uncle"")... families are rarely democratic or ""fair"" institutions, and these adult sibling patterns commonly rooted in disproportionate parental support, investment, encouragement, love, and sometimes or often abuse.

@jaquevius,"This is/was my family. I went to Duke med school, started my own business, worked my butt off/saved/invested etc. My brothers never left ""the nest"". One killed himself last year at 45, and the other, at least at the funeral, was so addicted to crack/meth that he had picked his skin to the degree he had to wear long sleeves and gloves at a summer funeral. His friends intervened and even paid for a 30d inpatient stay in rehab out of state (which infuriated my drug addicted parents btw), that he checked himself out of on day 2. My parents of course enable to the degree that my now dead brother crawled under the house to evade social services while my parents claimed everything was fine. He hung and shot himself  in the head 2 weeks later, well after my parents saw the noose/planning. Sorry to be so dark, but this video brings back dark and current memories for me. Not proud to say, but I've cut off all ties with my family for my mental health. They have squandered significant resources and now urinate/defecate into buckets because they chose to spend what they have on drugs instead of plumbing, and they know I have saved/invested and will be able to support future generations of my family, so they try their best to pull at my heartstrings to wire money to their local quick pay loan store (my dad even tried to do this at the exact moment when I offered to pay everything for my brothers funeral). My dad was even hospitalized for  a lung issue from smoking crack. I've drawn a line, and will stop the generational dysfunction, and will pass on my generational wealth to my kids/grandkids but will not support this bullshit!

@jaquevius," @regaul4248  If I’m honest I would give a lot of credit to my HS girlfriends family. They heavily emphasized education. I had always done well in school despite the fact that I never tried. When I understood the value of studying and trying to do well, it just took off. I think god blessed me with the ability, but it definitely took hard work and dedication. I had a natural math/science way of seeing things, and became pretty adept in chemistry. Surprisingly my chemistry teacher in HS talked me into considering medicine since my personality better suited it, and I think he knew my abilities long before I did. Also, after a lot of counseling I realized that my paternal grandparents had an enormous influence on my formative years. My brothers were not as fortunate I’m afraid.",3년 전,4,

@redditlover694,"Not many people realise this, but this skit is actually way more thought out than you'd think. The parents already know about their son's engagements, and the whole thing is a setup in order to coax the brother into coming to the wedding.   The first clue that this is not just a ""surprise"" visit,  is that you can tell from the beginning this is not a usual dinner, serving good food, which takes preparation and is not something you would usually make on a normal day. Combine that with the wine on the table and wine glasses (so they can raise a glass and celebrate), which again, is not something you usually have with a normal dinner (for most families anyway). Then comes the father's ""we usually have to wait for a special occasion to see you!"", which is the dad's attempt at a ""natural segue"" into the reason of why the son has come to visit.    The final, and most obvious clue is that line at the end of the skit,; ""that went better than expected"". This line can be interpreted as the families attempt to conclude the situation and dismiss the brothers typical behaviour, but the choice of words in that line far better suits as a conclusion to the family's plan to get the brother to come, as ""going better than expected"" means that he seems to have agreed to be best man, but won't fly to Hawaii unless its first class, which is a win in the family's book. Either that, or I'm just overthinking the whole thing lmao",4년 전,3,

It actually surprised me that someone took the time to argue this perspective. Many countries take multigenerational care for granted while most folks in the West can't wait to shove their parents off to institutions to get the old farts off their hands.   The difference between Westerners and the more traditional countries is that some Western parents tend to treat their ""little angels"" much worse until they realize they need them. By that point it's usually too late and the damage is done.    I'm going to join the military, secure a steady income, and leave them in the dust where they belong.",3년 전(수정됨),1,

Additionally, I’d suggest taking advantage of the free college education you would get out of the military.. or if you’d rather learn a trade you can also take advantage of that option.

@Mrfam101,"A year and a half ago I was the happiest I ever been. I had a girlfriend of 7 years who was my best friend, we were engaged and looking for a house to live together. In March 2020 she just broke up with me all of the sudden, until now I don’t even know what hit me. Then the first covid lockdown started a few days later. After that I just slid into a depression, got really insecure, and I am also slowly balding, which destroys my confidence. I am not like Clive, but this clip really gets to me because I can see how some people can end up like that if they’re not strong enough when mental health becomes an issue in their life. The truth is that my parents really had to be very patient with me in the past year. I am now in the process of moving out of parents house to live alone, and try to start a new life where I can find my confidence and happiness again. Some people are like Clive, and some will always be, but sometimes it really doesn’t take much to end up like that… pay attention to the signs and change before it happens.

@AnusheelSharma,"Nothing about this skit is laughable, I don't yell at my mom like the guy shown in the skit, but there are times when, pointing out your parents mistake is considered to be rude by them, nobody is perfect, not even my parents, Indian parents has this tendency to make their child believe that they are near perfect, what ever they do, say is right, and their child should abide by them, no questions asked, and when the child grows up to become an adult and start pointing out their mistakes they get upset and never admitt to their mistakes, and instead start pointing out your mistakes and turn it into a blame game, situation of Indian middle class family is different from what it is in America, many people are talking about how the ride brother shown in the skit still lives with his parents and does nothing productive, and most people in America consider living with ones parents as an unsuccesful habit, but here in India, if the newer generation thinks about moving out of their home and starting a new life for themselves, that is considered to be an extreme betrayal to ones parents, according to Indian parents, no matter how successful you are you should live with your parents for your entire life, even after getting married, and iam sure you all have seen the meme based on Indian parents not respecting their children's privacy, that is entirely true, atleast in my case, for example the way you reach the prayer room in my house is through my room, so every morning my mother will wake me up so she can get to the prayer room   doesn't matter if iam deep asleep, and forget about bringing your girlfriend over to your room or any of your female friend, that doesn't happen in Indian household, life is very different, atleast my mom understand 60% of my expectations and wishes, but my dad is a perfect e.g of an Indian dad, the communication gap between me and my dad is so much that he doesn't even know about my likes and preferences or my choices and there are so many things he doesn't know about me, life is very different, but we I guess we don't have a choice, we should be grateful for the life that we have got, as we are all here by chance.",4년 전,0,

@b7wL9cJk3,"what does it mean? please, confusing for a non-englisher",4년 전,5,
@roberthiggins2252," @b7wL9cJk3  There is a game show called ""Price Is Right"" that is popular in America. In that game show, there are women/models who help introduce items contestants can win if they can guess how much each item costs.  So what the angry brother is saying, is that the model on Price Is Right isn't doing a good job presenting those items because contestants think they are worth less than they really are. So the joke is that the brother is marrying a beautiful and successful model, and the other brother has to be negative about everything, so the only thing he can criticize is that he thinks she isn't a good presenter of the items she displays. (This joke is expressed best in an idiom in English called ""Sour Grapes"" based off of ""Aesop's Fables"". This is when something good happens to someone else, but to make yourself feel better you find fault with it. An example would be if your friend bought a brand new car, and you respond ""It's not smart to be brand new cars because they only go down in value the moment you drive it off the lot. So just because you can't afford to buy a brand new car, you find fault with someone who can."")  It is also funny on another level because the show comes on at 10:00 o'clock Monday through Friday, and that is when most responsible men are at work earning a salary.  And so I responded ""this is the reason that a video can't be on youtube that doesn't already have 'dislikes' "" because there is always a negative person out there who will ""thumbs down"" even the best video out of spite.",4년 전(수정됨),73,

@badwulff," @faznanbadri6854  No, I've never been caned, because I didn't have abusive parents. I was, however, slapped once or twice. Never damaged me - I would imagine a cane is more damage, because you might lacerate the skin, perhaps even break bones. I will say, though, talking about the best methods of torturing children is not something I enjoy, and the fact you've given this much thought to how to inflict as much pain as possible, without actually killing the child, or hitting ""important blood vessels"", speaks quite largely to how bad your parents were, and how inhumane this method of raising children is.  I'm sorry to hear that you've been abused, and I hope this abuse doesn't extend to your child/children; otherwise I wish them the best in getting away from you. If you don't have any children yet, I sincerely hope you change your views on how to treat children before you actually have them. Perhaps therapy, to treat unresolved issues from your parents' abuse, would help.",4년 전(수정됨),9,
@faznanbadri6854," @badwulff  yep, you never being caned before. no wonder you think being cane can break bone. do me a favor will you? Go to search engine and type ""Rotan"". if you assume the parent actually hit as hard as they can when they punished their children, i rather get caned on the leg and have some clothes covered area, rather than slapping across the bare face, don't you thinking?  hence my first reply, "",maybe a little bit, just a little bit"". you assume i what meant by caning is like some prison-type caning punish speak volume about your brain capacity maybe your parent did rattle your brain when you were kid? when the last time you do CT Scan? you should schedule one soon.",4년 전(수정됨),19,
@badwulff," @faznanbadri6854  Rotan gives me a town in Texas. I'm pretty sure you were referring to ""rattan"", which, while I can see it not breaking bone like traditional ""canes"", still seems inhumane and violent.  All I can say is, I'm glad I never got caned, it sounds painful. Above all, it sounds ineffective - again, why is the goal to inflict as much pain as possible, and how does this accomplish the goal of showing authority better than non-physical punishments? Regardless of the long-lasting effects, this seems cruel and abusive. And bad parenting. If you're a good parent, you shouldn't have to resort to physical humiliation, and cruel torture, to get your point across. It seems to me people like you are just using ""parenting"" as an excuse to beat up your children to make yourself feel better. This looks lazy and weak.  We ain't livin' in the 1920's, my dude - you may be from an Asian country where this is a common practice, but from my point of view, it's a terrible, outdated and ineffective common practice.  At the end of the day, this is quite simple: we can go back and forth all we want about how good or not physical punishment using tools like canes is ; but, if you can't cite me studies that show definitively that corporal punishments like these result in healthier, more well-adjusted adults, I'm just going to say this is an excuse for physical abuse hid under the veneer of traditional parenting, and one of those traditions the world should do away with, same as forced marriage, or castes in India.",4년 전,8,

I could do the reasonable, adult thing, and assume you're a non-native English speaker, from a foreign country, or I could say, like you did when you decided to insult me instead of assuming perhaps I wasn't familiar with tools used to torture children: ""It seems your parental abuse impaired your ability to use sentences correctly. Perhaps caning does have more long-lasting effects than you think?""  Did the abuse you suffer at the hands of your parents prevent you from conducting civil discussion?

@badwulff," @faznanbadri6854  Right. I really believe you when you say a slap of the hand is as impactful as, or more than, taking sticks as f***ing hand-to-hand weapons against kids. Logan Paul's an idiot with parents that are probably terrible, but that says nothing about the times - spoiled brats have been in existence since parenting was invented (including during the 20th century, when actual hard canes were being used). By the way, ""our modernity"" has also enabled children not to go work in the coal mines ; is that also too soft and progressive for your medieval a*s? Perhaps, according to you, we should revert back to Oliver Twist-era Victorian England? ""Little girls must be seen and not heard"", and all that, am I right?

@RyuLongRHOG,"There's so many things wrong with this thread I can't even & I don't wanna. I don't consider small punishments & pains administered at the right time & right way to children for their overall betterment & personality development as child abuse. Here exists both a difference of both definitions & also understanding or estimating the threshold of mental/physical durability of a child. We administer small penances to associate bad behaviour to pain or discomfort or something that should be avoided; to program them to disassociate themselves, even automatically/subconsciously, at an age when they haven't fully come to their devices to make rational choices themselves, and also for that development too. It's giving them directions like every parent does, albeit in a stronger way.  These kinds of punishments register more, the memory lasts more, & guides you even more. I consider it abuse when the INTENTION behind the penance was NOT for the betterment of the child and/or the penance inflicts a more-than-immediate/long-lasting mental/physical damages. But if u do it for your child/ward to become a better person and it doesn't hurt/scar him permanently, then I advise u should do it. Stronger memories make better teachers. There are a lot  really really bad behaviours that you should groom your child to not pick up, or if they do pick up, you should groom them to remove out of himself/herself. And for grooming them, u can use any humanitarian techniques that doesn't scar/hurt them beyond that day. U don't see soldiers in their career-days coming out saying training-camp were completely inhuman, abusive or self-destroying. I'm not saying to train your kids boot-camp style; I'm just saying some pains & punishments may better prepare your kids for adult life; or their adult lives are gonna throw even more punishments at them than they are already gonna throw at them. I have always found that in life, smaller (but numerous) pains (especially early on), keep away the bigger hardships/pains (later on) away. AND, also, learn about temperary-spankings (punishments that are really painful but absolutely no damages). In my family, my eldest Aunt & her husband were the strictest with their children in our family; they would beat them & shout at them. My cousin-brother-&-sisters were miserable at that time. But now they are all married & have really high-paying jobs are all very happy. One of them is in America now. They     all now sometimes say how thankful they are for their parents strictness & understands why a loving parent has to do what they do. Whereas if u are an egotistical parent, an unloving parent, a psycho person, an ignorant parent who doesn't know when to stop, any of these, then DON'T even go NEAR your child. The intention here is to give the child the right perspectives to the right degrees.",4년 전,0,

I will say that (and this is in no way an attempt at sounding meaninglessly tough or masculine) if a full grown man spoke that way to my mother (at her own dinner table no less), no matter what his relationship is to her or myself, I would have stood up and immediately kicked him in the chest.

But my comment had nothing to do with that - I was simply responding to the assertions that ""caning"" somehow helps with education of children, and saying that in my mind, that's no more than just an elaborate form of abuse. The guy I was responding to outright said ""we dont go straight for beating for 1st wrong doing"" (implying that in their household, beating children - not, like, slapping, or even just hitting them, beating was acceptable), and then went into detail about how to physically abuse children with a cane without leaving lasting marks.

@emdiar6588," @everythingisawesome2903  Ceremony? Who cares about that? I wanted to marry my wife because I wanted to be married to her, and spend my life with her. not because I wanted to play dress up for a day, in some commercialised ritual for public display. I'd have happily just shown up and signed a contract. ""Are we married yet? Nice! Now lets get on with our lives.""   Our joy was in committing to each other. Nothing else really mattered. Confetti lasts a day then its just some soggy dirty trash.  Am I right in assuming you are a woman? They usually get more into the circus of it. They get to look pretty and bask in the attention. They are the ones who grew up fantasising about horse drawn carriages and a gorgeous dress that costs thousands and gets worn for an hour.  Second question: What do you mean by 'Asian'? As a Brit I take that to mean you are Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi etc, but my American friends always use that word to mean Chinese/Japanese/Korean etc.  I don't know anything about EAST Asian weddings, I don't know the culture. Is it customary for marriages to be 'arranged' behind your back by your parents?  I've seen plenty (and attended two) SOUTH Asian (Indian) weddings. On both occasions the groom told me he couldn't wait for the day to be over, but the Bride was clearly the star of her own Bollywood movie for the day and loving every minute of it.   As a man, I don't begrudge women this, but it should be known, that when we go through that long, gruelling, expensive, stressful pantomime, we are not doing it for us.... we are doing it for you.

@nightmoose, @jdadams77  the guy needs therapy. not saying he doesn't bear any responsibility but what you're describing sounds more like major depression or another psychiatric disorder than mere laziness. you're right his folks have to stop enabling him and basically need to have an intervention where they say they'll stop supporting him if he doesn't see a psychologist and/or make concrete steps towards independence.,4년 전,34,
@jdadams77," @nightmoose  I agree that he needs therapy and it's true he's not lazy in the conventional sense of just laying around just to lay around. He's been raised that way and has been given approval to do so so to him why try any harder when it's not going to help them especially with his mother telling him he's unable to do anything. The biggest thing is that his mother and father both need to go to a therapist that will push them to do the right thing for their son. His mother is in complete denial that he can do anything for himself and has made up so many excuses for him. I don't try to be hard on him because I know it won't do him any good but I do feel strongly that the 17-year-old, his younger brother needs more guidance now so he won't turn out to be like his older brother. I was trying to explain to him that by the time he reaches his older brother's age his parents will be in their eighties and it's very unlikely they're going to be able to take care of him in any kind of way.",4년 전,17,
@nightmoose," @jdadams77  I empathize with the situation...I am very familiar with a similar situation of an adult who never left the home, I suspect due to underlying psychiatric issues though he was also raised in a very strict environment so maybe it's a bit different. It sucks that social stigma/shame or the parent's own mental issues often lead to denial of these cases. it's a bit like the Hikikiomori incel phenomenon in Japan. the parents are always the enablers because they feel like they'd be admitting to failure as parents if they admit their kid is in a state of arrested development or not living in a healthy way. it's tough to be the spouse in that situation I guess you have to assess what your role is or can be...i.e. whether you and your wife can stage some sort of intervention for the whole family with a counselor where everyone maybe agrees to go to group therapy together or whatnot. I completely agree that's not a healthy situation for the 17 year old but if you mentor him he should be OK. if he goes to college, gets work experience etc. that will help put him on a good path and he may very well have already looked at his brother and decided to avoid a similar fate. it's not to late for the older brother either but yeah he certainly needs to find the courage to break down his pride/defenses and get help to start over.",4년 전,7,

He joined the military for 3 years. Took up photography. Got a business degree.  Got mad my dad wouldn’t give him money to start his own business without a business plan and no experience. He also was determined to date a stripper he felt really liked him. Then got fired from a few other jobs. He then bought a hot dog cart and kept it in my moms garage. He lived in NW .Ohio so only the summers were available. He started eating nonstop and had to stop doing hot dogs because he couldn’t stand. My mom had some surgeries and ld go back to help her. He went to the hospital with us. I didn’t go the way he would go and he literally screamed in the car while I was driving. I’ve never had anyone do that. He tried Uber, but his ratings were bad bc his vehicle smelled. I tried to help him but he thought it didn’t smell. Ever watch .hoarders? My mom convinced him to let my cousin and I clean his place. It was 5 ft deep with trash.took 3 days and filled 6 apartment size dumpsters. Then he was mad bc he said we threw out stuff he wanted to keep. Told him many times during those 3 days to get stuff he wanted out. My sad bought a new mattress for him and he freaked out. He wanted to be asked. He wanted to pick it out. His microwave was covered in filth. Bought a new one and he had another for.3 years after that his apt mgr told him he had to clean the apt or be evicted. It was a mess again and a delivery person complained to the mgmt. he told my mom that he thought I called them about it. Then he finally got evicted. After a week of sitting on the news he sent us an email saying he needed help and he’s so sorry, blah blah. He says he doesn’t know how to find an apt. So I’m 2,000 miles away (for a reason) trying to locate apartments. He found one that didn’t need a credit check and same area. Then he says he’s not sure it’s big enough, blah...  he goes back to look again. Then he calls a few days later and it was taken. He was shocked. I forgot to tell him that others were looking for apts also. He had a heart attack in there as well as more hospital stays. The other day he asked how to go about getting a cat. I live cats so .I ignored his message. He can’t take care of himself. My mom is his enabler. He also needs to file bankruptcy but just can’t find the time since he does nothing all day.",4년 전,0,
@BryceHouse,I hope you know that story just makes you sound like a dipshit. He’s not even a member of your own family and you felt entitled to speak to him that way?   Has it ever occurred to you that he probably has underlying mental disorders inhibiting him from functioning normally? And assholes like you definitely aren’t helping with that at all. You just casually mentioned him becoming homeless as if that isn’t an absolutely horrific thing to allow any human being to go through. The lack of empathy is astounding,4년 전,1,
@jdadams77," @BryceHouse  I'm sure he does have underlying problems. As a matter of fact I know he does but those problems were created by his mother. When she instilled fear in him in regards to anything to do with life (driving, work, outside activities) and at the same time shield him from life for decades it basically becomes self-propelling and almost impossible to undo. Now at 37 he expects to be fed daily as in meals cooked for him daily be provided with internet and a place to live and refuses to do anything to help. My point is I'm not going to support someone like that. He may have issues but he is not handicapped in that way he technically can go get a job. I don't have the financial means or the patience to support someone like that. Therefore the alternative for him is to get a job and establish himself in life or eventually have to struggle. Not everybody wins in life sometimes you have to struggle. I remember when I was a kid we had milk cartons as a coffee table and one small 10-in TV with the dial knobs for the entire house. I cannot sympathize with somebody that puts in zero effort and expects everything to be done for them. I'm not going to be a fool like his parents and let this problem continue on without a solution. All they are doing is kicking the can down the road until they are not able to kick it anymore and then either he's going to have to do something about it or have to struggle.",4년 전,0,

I once had to give him the heimlich maneuver to save his life because he's a literal idiot. Has never done a worthwhile thing in his life.  Then you have the eldest, 24 he is, and he just sits around and plays WoW all day and night, says he's going to be some star writer but inspiration has to strike, recently texted me talking about I should be ashamed that I was just ""sitting around"" while he was mowing the lawn back when I was still living with them.  But at that time, I had two jobs, paid ALL the bills and paid for everything!  He mows the lawn once every 2 weeks!  Its like... mind boggling the mindset that these broken people have.

I believe my wife's brothers seeing that they could make money from home makes me the perfect person to talk to them. The older brother now 38 still does nothing and it doesn't look like he has any plans to change anything in his life.

For the love of the son, his parent should do it before it gets too late.  To prevent this situation, proper PUNISHMENT is needed from the youth. Especially, those claims that all kind of coporal punishment is inhumane and is child abuse have very short history and not proven. Just look around whether younger generation grew without any punishment have healthier mentality then the edlers who got SLAPPED in their youth. Actually it is child abuse not to give any corporal punishment when it is needed., since it makes a person not to function as human. We just have to manage it not to become a violence out of anger.  If you love your child, slap him/her when it is needed. You cannot just leave a human being to become a garbage just because you want to be a nice parent.

The day before this there was also a big dog food mess because Kyra tore her bag open and that was also my moms entire fault but I cleaned it anyways and every day for the past few weeks I was constantly cleaning dog messes, but this one I was like fuck no I just woke up it stunk bad wasnt my fault in any capacity and my mom got home right when I found it and I told her you should've put them in my room then I went upstairs and laid down bc I was tired and she comes and saying I need it cleaned up by the time I get back (she was going to get a carpet cleaner for the stains) and I told her I didnt want to do that especially since it was her fault and she says she'll take away my electronics if I dont and I started getting annoyed bc ya know that's bullshit and I say I'm not doing it you make me clean after the dogs all the time (both dogs were her idea didnt even run it by me until the day before each dog on was an unpotty trained pup who was abused and the other was a very old dog who couldn't hold it and would have accidents) then she comes in takes my ps I get passed and told her we gotta make some rules because it was my house and she lives with me (long story I was not 18) and she gets pissy and had to defend herself this is my house blah blah blah then I start actually getting disrespectful for the first time and I used to have very bad anger issues and I lightly pushed and she almost tripped and she ran at me and grabbed me and wouldnt let go so I tried to get out and she went from grabbing to swinging so I put her in a headlock until she was finished then she kicked me out (she didnt really kick me out)  Edit:my bad if this is all over the place had to got straight from memory",4년 전(수정됨),0,
@OrangewaveSupreme," @diffusewizard7622  um, no offense dude but your mom seems incredibly unreasonable but now I get why she got so upset as to start swinging at you. I don’t have much experience with an unreasonable mother since it’s my dad that’s a fuckin asshole but I would advise to actually sit down with her and try to calmly discuss why you don’t like her behavior. Don’t put any emotion behind just use facts and evidence, make sure you set up arguments beforehand and bring plenty of evidence so you’re not caught unawares. If at any time you start getting angry then just stop talking, bring deep and slow, and if anything comes to mind, don’t say it. Just keep breathing until you calm down and if she says something that gets you upset or won’t stop talking just try to tune her out. Best of luck if you decide to go with my suggestion and i hope your relationship with her gets better.",4년 전,1,

Revelation 21:8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. Romans 5:8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. John 3:16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. Romans 10:9-10.  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. John 5:24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. 1John 5: 10-13 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. Ephesians 2:8-9  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Romans 8:1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 1 Corinthians 15:3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 2 Corinthians 5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. .....................",5년 전,0,

@GGG2OO0,"Ankit Sharma thats brave of you to say bro. 28 is not that old at all and you still have plenty of time to get your life and future career in order. People in their 50s go back to pursue higher education just to get promoted in the job they’re in or move on to different careers. There’s always time bro, but the women are whats not going to wait. So if you want a good good girl that you don’t already know, starting your life ASAP is what’s gonna give you the best options. Thems just the fax bro. Beautiful intelligent women already have plenty of options so make yourself worth it. If you don’t care about that then stay as long as u want with your parents as long as they don’t care haha. But a fulfilling life is a life where you can live completely independent and even be the one to support your parents. I hate to say that and talk about school and stuff but the only way to flourish is to have your finances in order. Even if you aren’t making that much at least have some to pay bills and spend money on yourself. Save save save bro. Join the military or something. That will propel you the fastest in life actually. They stop accepting people at 38 though haha. Just my advice man. No hard feelings but that’s just real sh¡t",5년 전,36,

@fresch4395,"Brah, let me tell you my story. I was always doing good in school like that, didnt have to lift a freaking finger. Thought in college it would be the same and at 22 will have my masters degree.  It didnt work out at all. I am soon 30 and still not finished. Well I am seeing the finish line and will be actually done in the sommer this year for sure.   And I also had reasons why it took so long. Always had to work for it and pay for everything myself, except housing, because I cannot afford to not live at home. I have done many jobs and one time my car broke down (which my older brother gifted me, because it was his old car) and it was sooo expensive to fix it, I was straight working for 2 years and actually was afraid that I will just end up in this Job for the rest of my life.   Regardless, I am so ashamed when I have to tell people that at almost 30 I am still living with my mom. And for some time I was thinking that I wont ever finish and get my shit together.  Man I thought I would've traveled the world and started a family at age 30. Not finish college and start working a ""real"" job.

@nero9506," @johnnyjoestar7143  Sorry to disappoint but that's not how genetics work when it comes to hair, it's a 50-50 if one of your parents has the balding gene.",4년 전,7,
@johnnyjoestar7143, @nero9506   The gene that causes baldness is located on the X chromosome. Women have 2 so MAJORITY of the time baldness is a dominate trait from your mother. Of course it isn't always because men have a single X chromosome too. Thats why I said the 'majority'. It definitely isn't 50/50 though,4년 전,1,
@nero9506," @johnnyjoestar7143  I believe you're confusing the probability of transmission of the gene with the fenotype expression of the recessive allele for males. If your mother has the recessive balding gene on BOTH X chromosomes then you'll most likely get it as well if you're a male, since you'd have AY/AY combinations (where A is the recessive allele responsible for balding). So unless a crossing over or a mutation happens there's not much you can do, that is true. However, that's not how genetics work since you're not accounting for the other allele. There isn't just one allele, but there's two, meaning that one is gonna make you go bald and the other won't. Which means that either way you get a 50% chance of getting one of the alleles from your parents, cause that's just how transmission works. Again, don't confuse transmission with expression, because otherwise we would have to consider every single genotype combination. For example, an a/a×a/Y crossbreed would have a 0% chance to result in balding from the balding gene alone.",4년 전(수정됨),2,
@nero9506," @johnnyjoestar7143  I'll make myself more clear because I actually think you misunderstood what other people believe and you're not actually wrong at all. Basically what most people mean when they say that the balding gene is carried by the mother is that you should only consider your mother side for said gene, and that you'll never get it from your father's side. As I said and I assume you also know, that's obviously not true because allele transmission occurs with a 50% rate on diploid organisms. In other words, they believe you can't get the balding gene from your father.",4년 전,0,
@johnnyjoestar7143," @nero9506   tbh nothing is certain in science so no one is really wrong here, Most commonly, studies have shown that the AR gene which codes for the protein responsible for baldness is sex linked on the X chromosome, which suggests that baldness is a dominantly inherited from your mother. BUT some studies show that there are other genetic variations responsible for baldness too which are actually equally inherited from both parents. So of course there's always  growing knowledge proving something right or wrong. Personally, I take these studies and my surroundings into consideration and come up with my own solution, I never say anything is 100 percent its always 'likely' or 'thought to be' . I encourage others to explore the topic and come up with their own solutions",4년 전,1,

@limepop340,"IIRC male-pattern baldness is X-linked, meaning the dad’s hairline has nothing to do with the son’s.  Edit: To elaborate, the main gene responsible in on the X chromosome, which is always given to male progeny by the mother (the father must give a Y chromosome, otherwise the child is a girl).  Therefore any genes expressed by the X chromosome in a father will not be passed down to his son.  A son’s hairline is completely unrelated to his father’s, so to get a picture of what his hair situation will look like, he should refer to males on his mom’s side (but not, say, his mom’s dad’s dad).  If your mom’s dad went bald, that’s at least 50% for you.  If your mom’s brother is going bald, that’s at least 25% for you (mom’s mom had the bald gene).  If both, at least 75%.",5년 전(수정됨),93,

@limepop340,"X Salz TL;DR: My best guess is you lost two coin flips.  There may be other considerations, but 25% is too large to start looking for alternative explanations in my opinion.  It’s not the case that the paternal gene is “more expressive” (whatever the hell that’s supposed to mean) because you don’t have a paternal X chromosome (unless your a woman, but then male-pattern baldness wouldn’t be an issue).  Knowing about your grandfather’s hair tells you your mother carries at least one “good” gene — at least 50% that you wouldn’t go bald.  Knowing your uncle’s hair tells you your grandmother carries — at least a 50% chance your mother has a “good” maternal X chromosome as well as the known “good” paternal X chromosome.  Given the genotypes of your maternal grandparents, you had a 25% chance of going bald, assuming it’s the most common gene.  It’s not just “what they say”, there’s science backing it, and there’s always going to be people who fall into the minority case.  With a history going farther back or with more uncles, you can be more and more certain, but never 100%.  However, this is only the most likely cause.  Less commonly are autosomal genes linked to baldness, so theoretically there could be inheritance from your father.  However, this seems (I’m no geneticist, so take this with a grain of salt) less likely then landing in the aforementioned 25%.  Without a more extensive history, your grandmother and mother both being carriers is the explanation I’m happier with.  Lastly, there could be an environmental cause.  There are a lot of myths, but there’re probably some legitimate on-genetic causes.",5년 전,1,

But when u cancel my entertainment, and label every white ma a racist, spend 4 years calling my pres a racist, and have every media personality back up these false accusations..buddy you can take it to the bank that my ass will be making any and all noise I can fighting back against these anti-white anti-American assholes who are literally destroying our country by pushing the divide.   I don’t give a tiny bit of shit how petty or exaggerated I sound because it will never compare to the amount of lies and fake outrage the liberal left is responsible for. LITERALLY these assholes are calling anything white, racist from milk to rice to the White House itself.  Any person can easily research the origins of racism and find that it is the backbone of the Democratic Party.

@pasijutaulietuviuesas9174," @51OAKLANDER510  Listen to the second person explaining to you, not the first one. The first one is basing their definition on inaccurate internet memes. The second one actually explains what it means. Also, one thing to add is that women can also be incels. And it's in no way a rarity either. Incel is not a gender-based category. Incels are people who are celibate involuntarily. It says nothing about their character, or their behaviour. They could be good people, they could be assholes. How they treat others is not what makes them incels. The fact that they're unable to get a partner is what makes them incels.

@PinkyPuff69,🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂,5년 전,1,
@PinkyPuff69,Heartstorng Rose  Good point. The term Incel describes an involuntarily celebate male. Specifically male because there’s a sense of entitlement and expectation that a lot of men adopt in response to their isolation from women and feel it’s their right to get sex on demand. I’ve never known the term being for women. And there’s a socio-political profile that incels symbolize. A white male who is typically of the conservative political view and is angry and resentful of women not meeting his needs so he directs his outrage about his repressed sexual desires not being fulfilled  on innocent groups/gatherings of people by breaking out the old AK-47 and killing as many people as possible before the police come and they then decide to commit suicide to avoid the dreaded vulnerability of being exposed as a lunatic.,5년 전(수정됨),5,
@PinkyPuff69,Heartstorng Rose  Absolutely that’s it.,5년 전,1,
@PinkyPuff69,Jon Boner  I think you’re the one working with a fantasy. The actual issue isn’t the availability of sex and who can get laid the most. The issue is the incel and what makes a person an incel. Incels blame their unmet desires on other people but the true problem is their own thoughts and actions. They show little insight by lashing out at women and not looking inward for answers to their problems.,5년 전(수정됨),5,
@PinkyPuff69,"Jon Boner  That’s true. The feminist insult I will overlook this time but only because you defined the true incel profile. Male, disgruntled, mass shooters. And the term incel is their own, not any of us “marxists” made that up.",5년 전,7,

@pasijutaulietuviuesas9174," @totogashloog2162  That's a stupid name that basically means the same thing as ""female incel"". Incel means ""involuntary celibate"". ""femcel"" is just an abbreviation.",5년 전,0,
@Sesquiped," @pasijutaulietuviuesas9174  ""What you describe here is nothing but leftist propaganda and cannot be further from the truth.""  No, I think you're the one who's fallen victim to propaganda.  I've spoken with incels.  I've read their forums.  A person who hasn't had sex is a virgin.  An incel is specifically a male who blames his problems on feminism and progressive culture.  There can be femcels, but the vast majority are males, and it is NOT a healthy outlook to have.  Most of these people glorify mass shootings and suicides and celebrate the rape and assault of women.  Feel free to say ""you've fallen for the brainwashing too,"" but allow me to be clear when I say this: I have been in their forums and read their thoughts directly.  Not all virgins are incels.  If you can honestly say that you believe otherwise, you're woefully undereducated on the subject, and you're being actively harmful by being an incel apologist.  These people need help, but we also need to be very wary of them.  The community actively breeds and praises mass shooters.  Go ask for opinions about Elliot Rogers on one of their forums and educate yourself.",5년 전(수정됨),9,
@pasijutaulietuviuesas9174," @Sesquiped  ""incel"" is not an outlook, it is a state of being. It's not an opinion, it's not an ideology. You cannot identify yourself as an incel like some sort of a community. There is no incel community. There are no incel forums. Like I said in the previous comment, the now popular definition is misleading and created by propaganda spreading media to create an image of ""the bad guy we should avoid"". The people in the forums you've read are a response, not the cause of media spreading nonsense. In a similar way Trump supporters are calling themselves ""deplorables"" after Hillary Clinton's remark. ""Incel"" became nothing more than an insult that the left side can use on nearly anyone on the right, depending on the context. Even people with wives and kids are sometimes called incels nowadays. There could be incel forums, and there were some years ago. The content of those forums were people sharing ideas and advice how to pick up girls, most of which were absolutely crappy and never worked, but the point is that they tried to pick up girls. That is until they were highjacked by misogynists after the media called misogynists ""incels"". I'm not confusing incel with virgin. You're confusing incel with misogynist.  ""Not all virgins are incels"". True, some are voluntarily virgin. However, not all incels are virgin either. Some incels have had sexual intercourse at one point in their lives. Also, did you just call me ""incel apologist"" after I repeatedly called them failures in life? Seriously?  And you can come and say that ""words change meanings, language evolves"" but I'm a strong advocate against this. It's not linguistic evolution, it's a perversion of language. English is famous for being perverted by misuse. The problem with that is that this perversion of language actually affects society and culture in a very negative way. Not only society and culture, but also whatever can be considered truth. Truth became a liquid thing in English. Before you can claim something as true, you are forced to address the ""depends on what you mean by"" statement. And that allows a severe manipulation of truth.",5년 전,1,

I know you are disgusting with the idea rob the rich share to the poor, do nothing but still live like a king. Communism isn't like that but Capitalism is more like exploit the poor, make the middle class become our shield and sword, protect the rich from any harm, the one will destroy any enemy for the rich, then when they become the poor, they are mirror for communism. The poor deserve it because they are lazy, stupid, uneducated,.....etc. But some of rich because they win a lottery, sell drug,  .....etc. They programed us that way, that why they make us say pledge of allegiance everymorning, when I'm 12, I didn't know anything, just repeat like a machine.

Free healthcare for everyone, but that doesn’t help when you have to wait half a year for a vital surgery. Or you break an arm. You have to wait hours if not days to get any sort of treatment.

@gonkong5638,"​ @thatonedude-6819  I understand what you saying.  Healthcare is big problem. But it have nothing to do with socialism or capitalism, it's more like problem of a country, Europe has a shortage of doctors. It's essential for everyone. I've visited some country like Japan, China, Korea and North Europe. Their health care is great, I don't need to wait more than 2 hour in Japan hospital for a lung treatment despite I'm foreigner. I don't think China censorship anything beside what the West try to poke them, make them unblance then decline. We have a China Uncensorship, laowhy86, serpentza, Wion youtube channel here. They all push their proganda against China. Did you see anything like that against Cuba ? or Russia ? I can use VPN to fully access what I can in the West. I saw those HongKong citizen got beaten, burning alive just because they didn't agree which protester about freedom, that's not freedom, it's pure violence. I saw those blond hair, blue eye Chinese from West China willing to fight back those extreme muslim funded by UEA riot, rob, rape woman and children in Chinese. ""the USA can not use their power to bully their citizens."" I disagree with this, we all thought we can fight back against the evil, corrupted elite, but all we can do is run like Snowden it doesn't matter where you live, you have a chance to be disappear if you go against Yakuza boss, Mafia, Chinese gorverment, Son of CIA leader, US navy, Putin family...etc.",5년 전(수정됨),1,
@thatonedude-6819,Gon Kong Gon Kong clearly you have not been informed on what companies have been doing. Hell even the world health organization.Companies are afraid to say anything bad about China for fear that they lose that section of the market. Because China would just prevent their citizens from being able to access that. Also I do think universal healthcare is matter a socialism and capitalism. Not everyone has the knowledge of the outside world like you or I do. China has an evil government. The government in the US can not bully their citizens. The US government only has power over their them if the they don’t take away their right to govern. Now what you’re talking about are super rich people. I’m a little confused about what were discussing and what your stances are so let me go first  Socialism is immoral China is evil Capitalist Free Market is good,5년 전,0,
@thatonedude-6819,Gon Kong in addition to people in Hong Kong getting beaten because they didn’t believe in Freedom with them. I’m sure you’re familiar with Hong Kong’s history but just in case. Hong Kong use to be under British rule. Then there was an agreement to handover rule of Hong Kong to China. Now China is trying oppress the people in Hong Kong eliminating their rights which could lead to horrible results. Such as the 2019 Hong Kong extradition bill. I don’t know about you but I do literally anything to make sure that a bill like this doesn’t get passed if I were in Hong Kong. That bill is extremely dangerous to anyone who gets involved with the legal system. It seems to be you’re not on board with any freedom  I do appreciate you giving actual arguments and not insulting.

@gonkong5638,"​ @thatonedude-6819  I don't believe a person beat, set other people on fire is moral. That's not free people. I don't believe any goverment is complete evil, immoral. That's just common sense, we've saw in the history, if the goverment is too evil, opresse their own people, they will be overthrow. Always. But when I meet Chinese people, they smile, 300milion go travel every year, their house is nice. What I can say ? I critize their goverment because of that ? Sure, we have children work for a penny a day in Asia. It's not common in the West World because we rich, but it's more common than you think: India, China, Laos,Cambodia,......Thailand even use child prostitute make me really question about their sanity.   Back to Hong Kong : I don't think we(foreigner) have any bussiness here. It's their country, their choice, the British should never come nor make problem here. Just like they do in India and now we have 2 nuclear state alwasy want to kill eachothers. We have the luck born in sea of chance just live your good life.

@jeanlubin5864, @gamethuat  I think it is because Peele on this sketch delivered the drama so well. From his f**ked up hairline to all of these below: 1. Grown man lives with his parents. 2. Eating frozen pizza and drinking beer while the family is having a nice dinner and wine. 3. Jealous of the younger brothers success. 4. No manners for his mother 5. And a lot of people on the comment box has either known or heard of someone like him in real life. 6. Peele as an actor portraited the reality so well onto the character that people are amused by that. But yes both did awesome with their role.,5년 전(수정됨),2,

@honklerton732,"50% of ALL marriages in the US DO in fact end in divorce - and 80% of all divorces are initiated by women.   THAT IS A FACT!  It's funny that they include this fact in this skit as if it isn't true... IT IS.  Also - in the state of Khuchkifornia ALONE the divorce rate is 75%!!!!!!! Did you get a 3 sided die?  Take your roll!  Personally, I'd rather NOT get married.  Oh and nice try trying to stereotype people who REFUSE to get married as individuals who still live with their parents.  I myself already have completely paid off my 3800 square foot home IN A NICE neighborhood here in Scottsdale AZ (NO ROOMMATES... JUST ME!)  I also have my motorcycle and car paid off.  I'm still making payments on my new truck but in about 4 years THAT TOO will be paid off.  I have a near-perfect credit score - and the loan I USED to have for my home had an interest rate of 2.3%!  I have a great career - and I do WHAT I WANT, WHEN I want (after work).  I don't have to ask a woman permission to do anything in my own home or when I want to go out, unlike many blue pilled and unhappily married idiots who did ""take the plunge"" and basically become the B!@#$ of the home and she becomes his MASTER!!!  I plan on retiring early.  I'm one of the SMART people who TOOK ADVANTAGE of the 401k offers back when I was 23 when I started my career - and I'm now 38.  Let's just say that has appreciated RATHER WELL!!!!!!!  :)    You want to know why all these people who get married want others to get married?  Misery loves company.  #MeToo?  #BelieveAllWomen?  How a HUGE majority of women voted for HILLARY in the last election?  Ladies - you are NOT even worth a one night stand anymore - I don't want any false accusations thrown MY way.  I LOVE my life - and I don't want to COMPLETE screw it all up by complicating it with any of you!  There are PLENTY of blue pill guys out there - you can go for them instead.  Keep telling yourselves that MGTOW men are like this idiot in the skit - WHATEVER helps you sleep at night.   LOL.  TRUMP 2020!!!  END CHAIN MIGRATION!!!  FINISH THE WALL!!!  REDUCE Legal Immigration by 90%!!! (This 1 million per year crap is WAY out of hand!!!)  BRING BACK MANUFACTURING TO THE US (especially MEDICAL Manufacturing)!!!,   PROTECT THE 2ND AMENDMENT!!!   MGTOW MONK MODE 4 LIFE!!!!!!  THOSE WHO ARE WILLING TO THROW AWAY THEIR FREEDOM FOR ""Security"" DESERVE NEITHER!!!!!!!!!   GENDER IS NOT RELATIVE OR A CONSTRUCT!!!  CUT OFF ALL FEDERAL FUNDING FROM STATES WITH ""Sanctuary Cities.  END IDENTITY POLITICS!!!! NO TO COMMUNISM/SOCIALISM!!!! DRAIN THE SWAMP!!!!!!!!!!  Good luck you sex-thirsty virtue-signaling male-feminist celebrity worshipping beta-soy self-emasculating traitors!  You deserve to get married LOL!!!!!  To the conservative pro-marriage crowd:  Stop making things worse by telling men to get married.  You're sending 50% of them to a crappy life of misery - I've heard countless accounts from these divorced men - and I am GLAD and THANKFUL I have learned from THEIR mistakes instead of learning the hard way.  Times are different now - and the government just makes TOO much of an incentive for women to divorce men now - not to mention the anti-male biased judges and lawyers within the biased anti-male family courts.   This is your warning.  If you still go through with a marriage and end up getting a bad roll, you will only have yourself to blame at that point - since after reading this - ignorance is no longer an excuse.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@ark_alcor1048," @PaperweightBoxing  Yes, I am aware that this is a sketch comedy. And yes, I am aware that it's supposed to be an exaggeration. I get that. What I meant by my statement is that this isn't an exaggeration of a rivalry. The Merriam-Webster definitions of a rival are ""One of two or more striving to reach or obtain something that only one can possess"" and ""One striving for competitive advantage."" For the first definition, Keith's situation isn't exclusive to him. Clive could be in a similar position if he were generally a better person.  For the second definition, neither brother in the sketch is competing with each other. Keith is just living his life and Clive is being bitter because he couldn't be bothered to better himself. The title isn't an extreme rendition of the situation. It's just not the situation. If one of the brothers were actively trying to be better than the other, I wouldn't have made my comment. So to answer your questions: Yes, I understand this is a sketch comedy. Yes, I know that it's fake. And yes, I understand that it's an exaggeration. I was just stating a fact. Yet you decided it was necessary to take the time out of your day to get mad about it. Are you proud of yourself? Was attempting to mock me (Regardless of the inadequacy with which it was carried out) really worth your time? Next time you get mad about something someone says, I implore that you take a moment to at least try to understand the reasons they had for saying it, lest you waste your time attempting to attack the words stated.    https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rival",5년 전(수정됨),64,

@jjoe7078," @honklerton732  of course that one random piece of shit randomly inputs his political opinion where nobody asked.   but since you touched that on that topic,   4 of trumps broken promises not including anything related to covid which we all know he fucked up.  even republicans know... im pretty sure even you know.   he told you he’d cut your taxes, and that the super-rich like him would pay more. You bought it. But his 2017 tax law has done the opposite. By 2027, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, the richest 1 percent will have received 83 percent of the tax cut and the richest 0.1 percent, 60 percent of it. But more than half of all Americans — 53 percent — will pay more in taxes. As Trump told his wealthy friends at Mar-a-Lago just days after the tax bill became law, “You all just got a lot richer.”    He told you he’d repeal Obamacare and replace it with something “beautiful”... something cheaper... better... that covered all pre-existing conditions... including “insurance for everybody.” You bought it. But he didn’t repeal and he didn’t replace. He just ended up saying “Who knew insurance could be so complicated?” (Just as well: His plan would have knocked at least 24 million Americans off health insurance, including many of you.) Instead, he’s doing what he can to cut it back and replace it with nothing. According to the Commonwealth Fund, about 4 million Americans have lost health insurance in the last two years.      He promised to make two and four year colleges more affordable. You bought it. But Trump's most recent budget contains deep cuts in aid for low-income and first-generation college students, reduces Federal Work Study, and eliminates the 50 year old Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant program, which goes to more than a million poor college kids each year.      He said he’d use his business experience to whip the White House into shape. You bought it. But he has created the most dysfunctional, back-stabbing White House in modern history, and has already fired and replaced so many assistants that people there barely know who’s in charge of what.",5년 전,5,
@SometimesAbel,"Honklerton Most marriages stayed intact back in the day because were told to put up with abuse, their husband’s affairs etc. And also, how could they fend for themselves afterwards without a career/education? Nowadays most women don’t put up with those factors. Financial issues are also at the root of a lot of relationship issues regardless of political beliefs. Personally, I love to see older couples walking hand in hand and I know it took work to get there. I don’t think feminism is killing marriages, I think we live in a time where some people just don’t want to work on their relationship or themselves.",5년 전,18,

Kieth his younger brother, was always the talented one of the group and best looking. With good grades, great charisma, and a good attitude, it was clear why Kieth was the favorite in the family. By middle school Clive began showing signs of balding, thus only adding more to the constant bullying and rejection with girls. Meanwhile Kieth was getting all the ladies and was very popular. By highschool Clive tried to get a job, however none would except him due to his appearance. He looked like an old man a kids body and this caused discomfort for many people. Clive eventually dropped out of school due to the day to day bullying from peers and even teachers, a choice he would soon regret. Kieth moved out and pursued a very rewarding and successful career. However with no education, no personality, skills, or any job experience Clive struggled to even get a job at McDonald's. Left with no choice but to live with his parents Clive would never see the day where he would finally be accepted by a woman, let alone anyone.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@wheelmanstan,"When you're single and a sibling experiences this, (good job-house-wife-kids) each one of those successes, no matter how happy you are for that person, STINKS to hear when you don't have it and everyone knows it. There's nothing you can do about it, you just won't come across as thrilled and proud and supportive as you wish you could. The other sibling knows it and just hopes you'll do better and experience the same thing so you can both share the rest of your lives together. If you're not riding the wave of success with your sibling then you'll never really be in each other's lives because you'll be living at different speeds! It might be like this until the day you die, and it's pretty common unfortunately.   But you don't have to be miserable and drag others in it with you. You don't have to shoot down your sibling's dreams and aspirations and you don't have to mope around feeling undeserving of being a part of his/her family's lives. Your sibling knows you're trying and loves you anyway. Don't let pride fuck up your existence. Don't let money tear you apart. It's a dick move to expect your broke brother to be at your Hawaii wedding with a new tux, but it's also a dick move to not allow your brother to buy you a plane ticket to attend the wedding of his/her dreams. You gotta find some middle ground. It's not his fault you're broke, and if he's broke and can't afford to fly to Hawaii..then you should accept that.   Actually having weddings in Hawaii for example causes problems like this all the time. haha, this ain't the movies. Not everyone has money and suits on hand or even likes to/can  travel. You're wedding is everything to you, but to your friends/family they can think of a lot better ways to spend time and a lot of money than attending a wedding in Hawaii. They love you, but be considerate. Do you care more about the location of your wedding or about the people there to support you?

They do not have such a growth in homelessness and desperate poverty that the waiting list for Section 8 housing in this country has, in the past *two years*, grown from 2-5 years to TEN years. All while our so-called ""representatives"" are eating $65 breakfasts funded by the taxpayers, and are being wined and dined by lobbyists. It is capitalism, not socialism, that has privatized social institutions that were supposed to serve the public and now underserve them in favor of the almighty bottom line.

It's called the 'bait and switch', and the only reason you're making the argument you are is to say ""fascism isn't that bad, actually, if we don't call it Nazism"". It's a bullshit Alt-Right argument. It's so obvious, the only reason you missed it is because you're too busy licking their boots.

Interesting maneuver, false however as I am keenly aware that I am talking about up and down on the political spectrum.

Worry not though, the truth is out, God was made in the image of man to usurp his mighty creations in an attempt to force people into the default state of owing the cult. There is a reason the right doesn't like Trump as much as the left. Because all of them are traitors to mankind and Trump proved that their pathetic institutions are as fragile as their ego.  Someone once said current America looks like a specific time frame of WH40k. The lyrics of Months of Shame are spot on.   ""Does your hubris know no bounds? Our defiance, will resound!""  ""Then nor shall you prey on the weak, your words are hollow, these actions, meek.""

@GreyMan1793," infernovoid  I honestly believe the biggest reason (there is likely outside factors due to the disruption caused by technology, video games, social media, etc) is the due to the growth of the govt itself. In particular, I'd highlight the reaction to the 08' crash (you can likely lump in the dot com bubble as well) as the primary reason why individuals in the 18-35 age cohort are struggling.    When you inject endless amounts of money into a system, similar to what the federal reserve did not once or twice but three times, you create disequilibrium. It may be counter intuitive, but by adopting such a tact, we actually worsened wealth disparity. Worst yet, we weakened purchasing power (while student debt, a govt bubble in itself, has had a tangible effect I don't think it is the primary driver of delayed purchasing) thus delaying milestone purchasing decisions that people of the same age in the era of the 70's & 80's would not have had a problem purchasing.   What I'm trying to get at is that UBI, which again, that money has to come from somewhere, would only exacerbate the problems we have currently have.",5년 전,1,

@GreyMan1793,"infernovoid I admire Dalio a great deal and I’ll have to look into that video. ‘Principles’ is a great book. Honestly him, Jim Simons and  Nassim Talib are some of the people I look up to.   In my opinion the theoretical you posit seems to me like a big leap. But let’s say we were to agree that UBI could without a doubt achieve points 1 & 2. Why then do we limit ourselves to $1,000? Why do we settle on some arbitrarily chosen number. Why not give $10,000 or $100,000?  If I were to concede anywhere (and I state this grudgingly as I’m vehemently against taxes) it would be that VAT would most likely be the best solution in terms of funding. To add to that I think we have a whole lot of room to tax the middle class in this country.  Ideally if I were to structure a system, it would in all likelihood model that of the Finnish approach.   https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/e7us19/opinion_finland_is_a_capitalist_paradise/  In terms of technological displacement, I’d argue this is not something new to humanity. Whole industries have risen and died over the centuries, yet people found ways to produce livelihood still. The example I’m recalling, so forgive me if it’s wrong,  would be that of the spinning Jenny replacing individual cloth making artisans.   Anyways, nice having a discussion with you man.

@desi00000," @Jacob-ye7gu  so from what I can tell from your rant that scientific statistical polling isn't your thing. That's fine, but just because you don't like a fact doesn't mean it's not a fact. the CDC did not say in their report that this represented black fathers who were there in comparison to black fathers who were not. That's not at all what the report showed. It was talking about time spent overall, average, per ethnic group which means overall black fathers spend more time with their kids than white fathers. Not simply black fathers who are there but comparably black fathers on average as a group compared to fathers of all other ethnic groups on average. You can't just add parts to the statistic that you want to shape it The way you want to see it. Sorry but reality is simply reality and facts do matter. Have a wonderful day",5년 전(수정됨),0,
@Jacob-ye7gu," @desi00000  Lol I'm saying if you average the amount of time spent with children including all the black fathers, you'd have a bunch of 0's that would lower the average. The CDC didn't count those, and yes, on purpose, but it's a purposely misleading statistic. What does it mean? It means black fathers who stay are good fathers. But that's not the issue at hand. It's whether or not they stay. Which they don't. In general. Trying to change the issue to whether or not they are good fathers when they stay is purposely misleading.",5년 전,1,
@Jacob-ye7gu," @desi00000  So to clarify, the problem in the black community isn't that black fathers who stay with their families aren't nice enough to their children. No one cares about that. They only care about whether or not the father stays. That's the issue society cares about. So why is the CDC investigating and trying to find and publish such a useless statistic? One can only be led to the conclusion that it is purposeful in order to further an agenda that willfully ignores the real issues in society because it paints a politically correct story.",5년 전,1,
@desi00000, @Jacob-ye7gu  I have to admit I got a little lost in your logic. You seem to continue to imply extra meaning into the research the CDC did. They never researched how nice black fathers were to their children. They simply look to see if black fathers were present in their children lives and actually behaved as a father figure and compare that with fathers of other ethnic groups. That's all they researched. And it's not really up to you or anyone to decide what's right or wrong with Black Culture. There's plenty things wrong with our American culture and I could easily Point too many things problematic with white culture at the moment such as the opioid crisis or the fact that white Americans are the only ethnic group  in our country who are literally  dying younger than the generation before them so let's stop trying to assume that one group is better than another please. I can tell from your post that you have some sort of issue with race and that's something you're going to have to deal with in your own soul and heart but at the end of the day you are wrong. Just say you are wrong because the evidence does not Support your theory of the case or at least stop trying to force other people to believe factually inaccurate conspiracies. Black men are just as well suited for being present fathers as any other group and this research proved that,5년 전(수정됨),0,
@desi00000, T S  I don't agree with your premise that you can find racism very prevalent among black people in the media. One could argue that racism is quite prevalent in the media with none people of color such as AONN and Fox News and Breitbart. So I don't really agree with your premise,5년 전,0,
@desi00000, @Jacob-ye7gu  you keep saying that the CDC did not add a bunch of black fathers in their statistics but that's not true. This numbers indicate on average for the group not only for the group of fathers who were present. Why do you keep adding this extra concept to the research? you keep implying that there's this secret group of black men who are fathers who weren't counted which is not consistent with the research. I can send you another citation.,5년 전(수정됨),0,
@desi00000," @Jacob-ye7gu  here are the first two paragraphs of the research which are very clear that they are looking at fathers who are in the home and fathers who are not in the home which implies there looking at overall statistics for father-to-be groups and not simply fathers who are present. So your argument is invalid and here is the proof:  Abstract Objective—This report measures fathers’ involvement with their children. Father involvement is measured by how often a man participated in a set of activities in the last 4 weeks with children who were living with him and with children who were living apart from him. Involvement is measured separately for children aged 0–4 years and children aged 5–18 years. Increased involvement of fathers in their children’s lives has been associated with a range of positive outcomes for the children. Methods—The analyses presented in this report are based on a nationally representative sample of 10,403 men aged 15–44 years in the household population of the United States. The father-involvement measures are based on 2,200 fathers of children under age 5—1,790 who live with their children and 410 who live apart from their children, and on 3,166 fathers of children aged 5–18—2,091 who live with their children and 1,075 who live apart from their children.   in short, the research polled a cross section that would represent the entirety Of the ethnic groups named in the research and not simply polling the average of times spent by fathers who were present.",5년 전,0,

@Jacob-ye7gu," @desi00000  You can look up the numbers but 60% of black children grow up without a father, versus 30% for hispanics and 20% for whites.There is an obvious discrepancy between the CDC report and reality. I read the study and the results were just a series of statistics about participation in activities of everyday living not clearly pointing to a pattern. There wasn't even an attempt to make a summed involvement-score of some sort that could be compared between subgroups. It was clearly, just as the subsequent articles written about it afterwards in the leftist news outlets, an attempt to obfuscate the issue.  It's on the face of it absurd to suggest that the black children, a majority living without their fathers, are receiving the same kind of contribution of fatherhood in their lives as other groups. And of course your response couldn't go without the obligatory accusation that I'm racist for questioning your conclusions from that worthless study. That's really what the leftist news outlets were banking on. They could parade around these nonsense stats as meaningful and then call anyone racist who questions them",5년 전,0,
@desi00000," @Jacob-ye7gu   CDC is a governmental agency underneath the Trump administration at this moment. The CDC is the agency along with the HHS who are the two agencies in charge of collecting this sort of data so any data or information you provide  me as far as a statistic needs to utilize one those two sources to be seen as credible  because they are the governmental agencies in charge as well as they are part of Trumps Administration. So I will utilize Trump's own governmental information but I'm not going to take Breitbart to any of the crap that you're using. by the way, your personal perspective about black people don't count as evidence one way or the other. Most black people I know have their fathers in their lives but that's not evidence either. I  will also take a census report taken from the government. Other than governmental sources though, I simply do not agree with what you have to say or think about the black community or black fathers involvement in their child's life living within or outside of the Family household . I'm not going to argue with a you about race. You clearly want to paint black people as irresponsible and negligent and bad. you also clearly don't have lots of black friends or you would realize the stuff you're saying is ridiculous.  And you can believe black males are inherently worse at being fathers all you want but it doesn't mean it's true and it doesn't mean that your viewpoint is based on reality or facts or statistics. It just means it's based on your upbringing and how your family talked about black people. you keep spouting off what I call feel facts. You feel they are facts but they're not.

@marcushendriksen8415," @desi00000  wow, thanks for the civil reply! It's sad, but you just can't count on those these days, especially in youtube comments. Anyway, I think the difference between our countries in race relations comes from context. In the case of the USA, the first interactions between black and white people were those of slavery, of domination and oppression, whereas in our case, they were of legitimate (if unfair) trade; furthermore, our first white associate, the British Empire, already had the manpower it needed. To be sure, there was some prejudice and even racism towards the natives here, but apart from a relatively short period, it wasn't what you could call institutional (Maori could drink from the same water fountains as whites, for example, and Maori and white children attended the same schools). In conclusion, I think it was a mixture of economic and historical circumstance that led to our current respective race relations. However, I am confident that things will improve on your end, as injustice is one of the greatest catalysts for change. Good luck to you all on that quest.

@Jacob-ye7gu," @desi00000  A big part of using statistics is understanding how they apply. The numbers the CDC produced in that paper you're talking about do not amount to a pattern. Read the results for yourself. Also, they never compared between races including both coresidential and noncoresidential. It was always within one group or another, so none of the numbers they reported can even be construed as comparing one race of fathers to another race of fathers as a whole.  Only within subsets, such as white noncoresidential vs black noncoresidential, etc. There was no inclusive white vs black, meaning coresidential+noncoresidential.  You can say that's controlling for other factors, but it's not because it's not as if being coresidential or not is something the father can't control. Don't you think part of being a good father could be, I don't know, living with your children?  All the measures they used are in fact correlated with positive outcomes in life, and the fact that they do not significantly differ between the races when controlling for coresidential status only strengthens the previous research correlating fathers living with their children with many positive life outcomes. It only strengthens the connection between crime and poverty in the black community and fatherless households. Because clearly the criteria the CDC study used were not meaningfully different between the races, so they can be ruled out as explanatory factors.  If you want some well known facts about the strongly negative correlations with growing up without a father, look no further than another government agency that has done a lot more work for a much longer time than the CDC on this issue, aka the Census Bureau: https://www.fatherhood.org/fatherhood-data-statistics",5년 전,0,

@Trunkerunk,"It's also skewed by the fact that some people have multiple marriages (and multiple divorces) in their lifetime. First marriages are quite a bit less likely to end in divorce than marriages in general, meanwhile if you've had a divorce in the past you're a lot more likely to have another and those people with multiple bring down the average marriage success rate.",5년 전,0,

@katiesowellpurvis5799,"Love and Trust are the basics of any relationship. Look before you leap but sometimes we swim before learning to crawl. I  was betrayed and almost destroyed due to pretense by my supposed to boyfriend. I discovered that he is a serial heart  wrecker and home destroyer. His joy is basically to see someone heartbroken. Not all men are reasonable and worth your  time. I had to clone is his phone when his antics were becoming unbearable only to find out that I was one of the many  ladies he is promising marriage, it's a game between him and his friends to know how many ladies they will leave at the  altar for 2019 and going to do more harm in 2020. Be weary who you call your friend. A very notable cyber hacker (ghostfacehunter) helped me in cloning his phone without him knowing, I just had to send him a link to my pictures and I got access to read his phone logs and messages as well pictures. It was a hard decision but I am glad that I will not fall such love victim again. You can also reach the hacker if you have relationship issues on trust. Clone his/her phone and if he/she is a cheater, kick him out.. you can reach the hacker through email or whatsapp number ( ghostfacehunter911 at g mail com, +447983500702). Also for your Instagram verification and authentication, he can be of service.",5년 전,0,

I didn't even think about slapping her, my hand just took control. And, my daughter knew that I had never hit her, she knew that I had just reached my limit. She said.....Mom, it's ok, I know I was wrong, I am sorry, I am ok mom. To this day my daughter is 17 today, and she has never talked back to me again.....ever. She hugs me tight whenever she has the opportunity. We are so close, and she is very respectful. Thank God. Thankfully I never had to spank any of my other children.

It's the parents fault, if they aren't stopping and correcting his behavior in this short clip, it's only because they have never stopped and corrected his behavior in the past as well, gaining them the title of ""enablers"". Enablers are typically covert narcissist that allow others to do their bidding, unless there is no one to do their bidding, they will remove their mask and begin the abuse themselves. They allow this behavior because they support it, and it keeps the heat off of them, allowing them to remain covert. A good way to rewatch this from this perspective is imagine that there is an unspoken game of good cop, bad cop being played between the toxic sibling and the parents; it will all make sense.",5년 전(수정됨),1,

@randomtexan1511,"Bd from the 213 I have an uncle like that but he’s not really a fck up more so an angry man with no self control. He’s been married and divorced and he’s had a few girlfriends but they broke up with him when they seen how he lives. He lives in a pretty nice apartment complex and drives a sports car but he’s lazy and my Nana spoils him so his apartment is always trashed with garbage, dirty laundry, and his pet’s excrements. He’s on disability too because he can’t work anymore because of his temper and at this point from years of living of my Nana’s aid he’s too overweight to work. He gets $900 from disability and another $1200 for spending money from my Nana which is about what I make in a month getting paid $11.50/hr for 50+ hr weeks with time and a half overtime. She bought him his car and she gives him money or takes him shopping for new clothes every month so he doesn’t have to do laundry. He literally has piles of perfectly fine clothes that he’s two lazy to take downstairs to the apartments laundromat and get cleaned. He also eats out all the time and then throw the trash on the floor. My parents paid to get his apartment cleaned, got him toiletries, a new wardrobe, and a pet potty station and a year later it was just as filthy as before. He smells bad too because he can’t get to his shower because of so much garbage so he gives himself dry baths (I think that’s what they’re called) with wipes or a wet wash cloth and like I said before he just buys new clothes when the other ones get stinky. It’s sad because we want to help him so he doesn’t have to live like that but at some point you have to take responsibility for certain things like bathing and doing laundry. If he lived closer I know my nana and Mom would help him out with that stuff but the closest family member to him is 1 1/2 hours away. We live in east Texas and he’s  north of us in the city and he won’t move down here even though we could help him more because of “all the damn republicans down there.”",5년 전,1,

@ProGamingProphecy," @x83_t76Y  Yes. It's the parents fault, if they aren't stopping and correcting his behavior in this short clip, it's only because they have never stopped and corrected his behavior in the past as well, gaining them the title of ""enablers"". Enablers are typically covert narcissist that allow others to do their bidding, unless there is no one to do their bidding, they will remove their mask and begin the abuse themselves. They allow this behavior because they support it, and it keeps the heat off of them, allowing them to remain covert. A good way to rewatch this from this perspective is imagine that there is an unspoken game of good cop, bad cop being played between the toxic sibling and the parents; it will all make sense.",5년 전(수정됨),15,
@wrnowown,And the entire family is effected if the behavior is allowed to continue. The shithead actually will continue to behave poorly with no change. I don't think separation helps I think the only logical step is therapy leading to psychological moral personality development over a long or a chunk of time. No escape but there is a solution read about other people in the same or similar situations and made it out and tell your story when you make it out.,5년 전(수정됨),5,

@maximumfedoratip5614,"​ @EmpireXbad  Sloppy seconds basically means you're having sex with somebody who's at the very least, not a virgin. In that, it's implied she lost her virginity to a man other than the one she's currently with. Her current man would, therefore, be getting ""sloppy seconds"". In the most literal sense of the phrase, it'd mean having sex with somebody right after somebody finished with them, maybe even in them. Most often though it's just used to demean women who've had too many partners for one person's liking. Something along the lines of ""So you're telling me your girlfriend has had 6 boyfriends before you? That's disgusting! Talk about sloppy seconds! Would you drink out of a soda can that has been drinken out of by a stranger? It's basically the same thing times 6!"". At least that sounds like something all the Clives of the world would say and think.",5년 전(수정됨),2,

Most of the people on Youtube are gamers and they don't look remotely close to this and that just proves that people just like picking on gamers for some reason because those people who pick on gamers actually lead boring lives and have no hobbies at all. I'll game until I die because Gaming is an Interactive Artform IMO. Games are becoming photorealistic experiences which gives your mind and soul an escape from the normal day to day life.,5년 전,26,

@blueish5063," @Gio23Deloney  How can you even tell if someone is a gamer out in public? A gamer can look like anyone. Look at all the gaming channels on youtube. Not one of those creators look even remotely like the guy in the video. To say gamers look like that is just a dumb old stereotype, not your observation. And it's a stereotype that can easily be disproven.",5년 전(수정됨),1,
@Gio23Deloney," @blueish5063  well it's usually the hair, they don't get haircuts or lineups for one, for two their Clothes are normally anime or some other type of gaming characteristic. Theirs 3 types of gamers....1. The person who only plays just because it's cool to play but not really be into it, they still get haircuts and go clubbing on a Friday and saturday night because they dont wanna not be cool with cool crowd, this is a small 10 percentage of gamers...2. You have the I.T. gamers whos more focused on tech and gaming mods and such, these guys seldom get haircuts, because they have to go be technical outside of their house/living rooms of their house and just not a trip to the game stop or best buy, because they know chicks dig a geek or technical gamer, this is about 25 percent of the gamers..3. Finally, and then you have the gamer who beat can an adventure game in 24 hours, who doesn't get haircuts, doesn't care about his clothes as long as there are gaming characters on it. Who doesn't care about the ladies but still has a porn website favorite, whos only exercise is from the couch to the microwave, and yells at his mom for not making sure his hot pocket, or tostitos pizza rolls are thoroughly cooked thru. Now I know this because I used to be a gamer and know many many gamers alike, I have a family and devote that time to then instead video games. So that's how I know little buddy!",5년 전,0,
@blueish5063," @Gio23Deloney  Little buddy? And wow. You've got it completely the other way round. Only 10% and 25% of the gamers are people who are capable going clubbing and getting haircuts and basically are living normal lives? Where do you get this information from? By watching alot of highschool teen movies that are full of cliches and stereotypes? You know, those ones that protray the jocks like alphas, and the nerds who play video games as goofy and clumsy.  Like I said before, your whole comment can easily just be disproven if you take a look at the gaming community here on youtube. Do any of those youtubers even remotely resemble the last category of your ""three types of gamers""? Of course not. The type of gamers that you're talking about are in the minority. Yes, they exist but they do not represent the gaming community or atleast not the majority of it.   Everyone plays game now, times have changed. More and more people are joining the community because of how advanced technolgy has become, the potential of storytelling has increased in games and how photorealistic they are now. And I can't help but think your comment comes as off as judgemental. Like playing games makes you the lowest of the low, when in actuality it can be considered a hobby or even be a profession. Games aren't necessarily bad, they're just another form of media like music or films.  This stereotype about most gamers being fat slobs, that live in their parent's basement and would rather play games more than anything else is absolutely false and is definetly outdated now. These types still do exist, but majority of gamers are not like them.  I'm glad to hear you're in a better state.

But like ive said before. My observation is simply mine, don't get this confused as me saying gamers are bad people because im not, I'm saying these type of gamers exist because ive seen it with my own eyes.

You wanna use an example from back then, how about the degenerate incel serial killer from the 70s? Half of them looked exactly as I described. Why? Because they sat inside fantasizing and wacking off all day long until becoming a killer.   No, im not saying greasy no life gamers are serial killers.

@duvide659," @meatyyeet3611  that's extremely unfortunate. unfortunately, you're dealing with parents with whom you have to prove yourself... as if just BEING yourself isn't good enough. this teaches the child that he/she is not loveable by default, but his ACTIONS are what get him love. you can turn into someone who only learns to love people based on what they do instead of who they are. it's a slippery slope you're on, but if you fight for yourself you can prevail..!",5년 전,13,

@Calilou52," @meatyyeet3611  Ive met many people who lived the path there parents wanted them to, every single one of them would do it over again if they could. A friend of a friend of mine even felt relief once his parents passed because he could finally look at life through his own lens.   If youre doing something you cant stand simply to fulfill your selfish parents dreams, youre gonna regret it. Just get the hell away from them asap if you can and if not then try and create the opportunity. When youre about 45 and starting to think about all the other great things you could have accomplished, all the time you wasted, all the stress and effort you put in for possibly nothing, where are your parents gonna be then?   Unless theyre giving you millions of dollars and a mansion when they pass, they have no right to make you their Guinea pig.  A parent as strict as that is nearly just as mentally abusive as an absent one. They think theyre doing you a favor by making sure youre set up for success, but whats financial success without the joy of life?   Hope everything works out for you m8, hope you get to live your best life! And if im 100% wrong and this is what you wanna be doing then good on you, but you will NOT be a loser without college. Ask anyone whos gotten a major within the last 5 years, ask em how much that college actually came in handy. I know so many women who went to a 4 year and got a psychology major or something and is now cutting hair for a living while the papers just sit in a file cabinet.",5년 전,2,

Wedding same thing.   However.... How does a old fashioned man proceed in this way like he wishes to if his own parents are very racist and thus reject the girl simply because she isn’t from the same race or a preselected list of races approved of by the parents?   I know deep in my heart the answer isn’t to just kill the love between me and the women and dump her simply because of the racism of my parents.... Cause that’s just wrong...

@Dildonion,To be fair that would be me but my mother and her family are Trump supporters and not the most loving people in the world so i feel like i have the right to be angry and petty and just give up on life. Also a military vet with ptsd whos fiance mother tried to murder only for fiance to tell the cops who i called a completely fake story which basically ruined my career and got me thrown in jail. Judge knew they were lying and dropped the case so i got off but the damage was done. Then said fiance within a month got knocked up by a Truck driver. So yea i am definitely that guy but i feel like i have the right to be. Did i mention the Truck driver was hispanic and my fiance and her family were black yet after everything that happened to me im still not a Trump supporter cuz it is fucked up. Also fiance has not talked to me since the incident been 7 years now and can't get any closure and she acts like she was the victim which disgusts me. Because how dare i call the cops on someone who literally smashed my head in with a kitchen mallet then proceeded to try and stab in the chest multiple times with a 9 inch kitchen blade. Sorry for the rant i have issues and wish i was dead.

@bubblebreak4160,Dildonion At some point you have to realize you’re free. I’m sure you’re angry and hurt and trying to get back at the world. But the world doesn’t care and you can’t get back at it. You’re just hurting yourself. But you can continue to live that way and not feel bad about it. You can live however you want because you are free. That being the case if you want to travel or get in shape or climb mountains just remember you are free to do that too. Just go do it.,5년 전,1,
@Dildonion, @bubblebreak4160   i appreciate the sentiment but we are not as free as you think. We are creatures who are at the whim of others and never truly free. Will society allow me to be a billionaire most likely not unless by a stroke of luck and even then someone will try and steal it from you. Can i travel to another planet or Solar System no i am stuck here. People who are Blind will never be able to see with there own eyes most but if they have the money maybe they can overcome any defect or handicap they might have. I do truly appreciate what you are trying to say but we really aren't truly free we just like to think we are.  I do not have the money to travel or to climb i basically just recently spent my life savings on a shitty laptop to chat with you fine people. All i would like is for my ex to apologize to me and tell me why she did what she did and that she knows it was wrong and to know what happened to me. For 7 years now i have not received that closure so i am not free to have that.,5년 전,0,

Thanks for not being an idiot. Of course I hope you were joking about the beating part because children should never be beaten.
