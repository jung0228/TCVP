Add the cord which is plant fibre of a given tensile strength woven onto itself. What are the odds of the right stick finding it’s own way into the hole in the stone then the cord straddling the stick evenly and twisting itself down the shaft. Before getting to the equal pulling of the string by a force that has knowledge and talent to pull and retract in near perfect sequence (many of us couldn’t do that).

@bullabuck7535,10 years later... primitive technology: how to make man-made sun using clay and wooden ash😂,3년 전,0,
@Артур-с7л3ч,"63:2.4 (712.4) As they advanced northward, they found open deposits of flint, and after selecting many stones shaped to suit various purposes, they stocked up for the future.  Trying to split these pieces of flint so that they better serve certain purposes, Andon discovered the property of flint to strike a spark and understood how fire is made.  True, at that time this thought did not strengthen in his mind, since the climate was still favorable and there was almost no need for fire. 63:2.5 (712.5) However, the autumn sun was sinking ever lower, and the further north they went, the colder the nights became.  To keep warm, they already had to use the skins of animals.  When about a month had passed since their escape, Andon explained to his friend that he knew a way to make fire with flint.  For two months they tried in vain to start a fire from a spark.  Every day, the twins persistently struck sparks from the flint, trying to light the wood.  Finally, one evening, at sunset, the secret of the method was solved when Fonta guessed to climb a nearby tree and get the nest abandoned by the birds.  The nest was dry and flammable, and so it burst into a bright flame as soon as a spark hit it.  They were so surprised and frightened by their success that they almost let the fire go out, but they managed to keep it alive by throwing in suitable fuel, and the first parents of all mankind went in search of firewood for the first time.

@pellepopcorn6129,"A new renaissance for neofascism?  How come? Well, obviously international neo nazis from Europe began to gather for weaponry training in St Petersburg, Russia. Invitations at first in 2008. A Swede called Anton Thulin was “educated” by an organisation called “Partizan” (Партизан) through links from “the Russian imperialistic movement RIM/RID” (русское имперское движение) in St Petersburg in 2015 and afterwards he went back to Sweden, where he and two other “classmates” carried out terrorist attacks in Gothenburg. They blew some bombs and were sentenced to jail (all the three convicted had links to the Russian group Partizan). In 2019, when he got out he went to Poland for more weaponry training, but was caught and expelled from Poland. Since then he has ended up on the American list of international terrorists.  RID formed their paramilitary branch “Imperial Legion” in 2008 and the that year they also began to travel to Sweden with invitations to Russia. After the war broke out in 2014, they began to send their members and foreigners, who got their weaponry training in St Petersburg, to fight towards to Ukrainians from Luhansk and Donetsk. Russian money are also given to Swedish neo nazi movements through RID, which of course gets these money from “Putins chef”, Jevgenij Prigozin, the well known Russian oligarch, who’s also the man behind the Russian army “the Wagner group” and the “Internet research agency” in St Petersburg. The former is led by real neo nazi, Dmitrij Utkin, and has fought the wars in Syria, Libya, the Central African Republic, Sudan and of course now in Ukraine. In 2017 it was estimated that the Wagner Group had about 6000 legosoldiers fighting in different war scenes. In April 2022 about 8000. This group is financed by the oligarchs close to Putin and is more of a branch within the GRU. The latter, Internet Research Agency (also known as Mediasintez, Glavset, Mixinfo, Azimut, Novinfo and aas the Trolls from Olgino) is well known as the Russian internet troll factory. From out of there you can expect cyberattacks and so many internet trolls, which you can’t even count. They certainly were active during both presidential elections in the US.  The links between neofascistic putinism and with far right wingers in the US and in the world are more than obvious. Get educated, since that’s the least that neofascists would want you to.

@LeLaidbackLauncher,"Please tell me if this is a stupid idea. But put 3-4 large sticks vertically in the ground, all the same height, taller than the stick you're using to start the fire. Use a two long lengths of rope wrapped around the rock, which has just a small groove and not an entire hole in it, and hook up the rock between the 4 sticks. Whenever you need to start a fire, just place the suspended rock ontop of the stick you are spinning to add wieght to the system as you work the pull chords. This way you only need to weave a few lengths of chord instead of drilling a hole through a rock with another rock. Saves time and effort, just as reusable too",3년 전,0,

@richardozz4154,I think it's good knowledge to now how to do these primitive things but with modern technology implemented in the design you can achieve the exact same outcome much faster with less time consuming energy involved with only a few minor upgrades to common materials available in today's world. Also think you would be cool to make a survival manual free to everyone on how to build / manufacturer such upgrades to materials. And it would be even more cool if it was done in a way that anyone could do / understand if they only wanted to survive. The type of survival guide I'm talking about would be handy if one day you just decided that you were tired of modern society and walked into the woods or wherever and decided to stay. Now that would be a cool survival guide.,3년 전(수정됨),0,

@daphneraven6745,"Primitive Technology:  thank you for this lovely video!  By way of giving back, may I suggest using a drop spindle to spin your fibres into cordage?  I think the technology would be congruent with the technology that you’re using there now, so if you were a purist when it comes to. Technology, I think you’ll be OK. You just take a wooden disk of some 2-3”, and put a wooden dowel  of about 6” through it. Rounding the lower tip would be optional. Take a Fairly short length of hand – spun cordage to affixed to the spindle just above the fly wheel, and you can just spin your cordage from the suspended spindle.  I’ve used just such a rig myself many times, and it works like a charm.  Not only can you spin your cordage up watch more rapidly, but it saves a lot of the wear and tear from the repetitive motion of your wrists and fingers.  Thanks again!",3년 전,0,

@LabGecko,"Get some moss, leaves, bark, whatever you want to make a fire of, make sure it's free of insects, and wrap it in something to put in your shirt, under a belt, in the side of your boot, anywhere that will stay dryer than outside. In Army survival we stuffed it in a bag in a pocket, but do what you can. Also look nearer the trunk of the tree, under branches to find dryer material, find rock overhangs, fallen trees, animal burrows (but I'd only risk that if desperate)... animals usually hide from rain too, and will probably be there.  Always be watching for dry tinder and keep it close. Then make a lean-to to build the fire under if you can't find other cover. A rock makes a good fire-building base if you can find a flat one. Sand drains well for a drying rack if you can't make one.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@yercules, @burntthetoast  I guess you still have stronger feet than most. Maybe try and train with progressive overload somehow. After a long day in shoewear the feet are just too tender to train.  Search for Dr. Emily Splichal. She sells these insoles that might be beneficial to wear in shoes as a training tool for barefeet.  Good luck!,2년 전(수정됨),0,

@Clashinite, @victorbazooka4327 I agree but by saying this you are implying that you advocate for mass suffering of billions due to the population being so high. Nature has a population cap and we a far passed that. We are hanging on for dear life with industrialized foods. Many would have to die for people to live off land and it would have to happen many of times because the cap limit doesn't change and population rises exponentially. Correct me if im wrong please.,4년 전,4,
@victorbazooka4327," @Clashinite  wrong. imagine all of world HUMAN population would detroy asphalt-roads and and cars(i bet we could make a mountain higher than everest with all thoise freaking cars people ""need"") i Bet it would take 2years to regrow earth and another 2-4 years for animals to settle. IF you read history then you know there more than just humans on earth and by mmy judgement id say 4/5 earth ""human pop"" is    not human at all. (it all happend 7000years ago and its easy to see if you read histpry combined with the few first pages of the bible + some modern archeology founds) And god said ""Behold for man has now become one of us..."" aliens.. they live among us already and they are the reason earth is being detroyed, cause when you live forever, you need a purpose. i know it sound fucked up :( Also it will never happen because then rich pigs had to give up their power, and there wouldnt be brainwashed people working for them.  It all boils down to the individual. I will never  own a car. i try not to buy my food at a store, i try not to buy clothes, going all the way down to using a massproduced scissor. And its difficult, cause you look like a hobo when you live like this, and when you look like a hobo, people look at you like you're shit (cause they are brainwashed into having that mentality) and that is by far the hardest thing about it.   It is actually easy to save the planet. the less you do the more you save earth. dont own a phone.. don't own a computer, dont use internet, dont fancy the idea of jobs, school, and governments (i know i write you now from a pc, with internet, bnut i didnt own a pc for 5 years, and i still dont want a phone. cause phones and cars are the 1. freaking weapons of mass detruction)",4년 전,1,
@victorbazooka4327," @Clashinite  Also we should live of the land as farmers but as hunters (the hunterpeople) roamed earth for 50000years unbtil 7000 years ago (read history) And what makes you think we would suffer? so i hope that like me you are never going to reproduce as you can just how disgustingly fast we overpopulate. i believe life would be more fun and real and not destroying earth would be a pleasure in it self, i ont care if i only had to live until i was 40-50 if that ment earth would be clean. in fact im suicidal cause its unbareable to watch people smiling while they drive around in freaking cars never putting 1 thought into their ugly roads being pollution aswel.  Also i forgot to mention that since 4/5 of mankind isnt human, then democracy isnt really a thing, yet its funny how democracy is pulled down as being the only political way that is good (one way to control)  And i mean i can walk over to a person who turned on their car, standing outside (cause they want the car heated up) just chatting to someone, then when i ask ""could you please turn of your car"" i'm met with anger and ""piss off"" We are brainwashed into being scared, cause divide and conquer. a phone removes you from people more than it connects you, same goes for internet. but then again im just a fucked up dude, who refuses to work yea? Oh yea and Covid divide us even more, eventhough this could be helpfull in this overpopulated world.  I have seen on a trainstation a wealthy looking elderly man speaking on his phone saying ""No sir it's not that kind of sinusitis, its another"" and after that he went to the train, whiped his hand on the doorhandle and left - just 1 way rich people make money of the poor. My rule of thumb is that you destroy earth everytime you need money for somehintg, yet i cannot be totally free cause im brainwashed and scared.

@baderalbader3478,"http://www.saaid.net/islam/1.htm  WHAT IS ISLAM? Can we find an explanation of the great universe? Is there any convincing interpretation of the secret of existence? We realize that no family can function properly without a responsible head, that no city can prosperously exist without sound administration, and that no state can survive without a leader of some kind. We also realize that nothing comes into being on its own. Moreover, we observe that the universe exists and functions in the most orderly manner, and that it has survived for hundreds of thousand of years. Can we then say that all this is accidental and haphazard? Can we attribute the existence of man and the whole world to mere chance. Man represents only a very small portion of the great universe. And if he can make plans and appreciate the merits of planning, then his own existence and the survival of the universe must also be a planned policy. This means that there is an extraordinary power to bring things into being and keep them moving in order. In the world then must be a great force in action to keep everything in order. In the beautiful nature there must be a Great creator who creates the most charming pieces of art produces every thing for a special purpose in life. The deeply enlightened people recognize this creator and call him Allah ""God"". He is not a man because no man can create or make another man. He is not an animal, nor he is a plant. He is neither an Idol nor is He a statue of any kind because non of these things can make itself or create anything else. He is different from all these things because he is the maker and keeper of them all. The maker of anything must be different from and greater than things which he makes. There are various ways to know God ""ALLAH'' and there are many things to tell about him. The great wonders and impressive marvels of the world are like open books in which we can read about God. Besides, God Himself comes to our aid through the many Messengers and revelations He has sent down to man. These Messengers and revelations tell us everything we need to know about God. The complete acceptance of the teachings and guidance of God 'Allah' as revealed to His Messengers Muhammad is the religion of Islam. Islam enjoins faith in the oneness and sovereignty of Allah, which makes man aware of meaningfulness of the Universe and of his place in it. This belief frees him from all fears and superstitions by making him conscious of the presence of the Almighty Allah and of man's obligations towards Him. This faith must be expressed and tested in actions, faith alone is not enough. Belief in one God requires that we look upon all humanity as one family under the universal Omnipotence of God the Creator and Nourisher of all. Islam rejects the idea of chosen people, making belief in God and good actions the only way to heaven. Thus, a direct relationship in established with God, without any intercessor. Islam is not a new religion. It is, in essence, the same message and guidance which Allah revealed to all Prophets. Adam, Noah, Abraham, Ismael, David, Moses and Jesus (PBUT). But the message which was revealed to Prophet Mohammed (PBUT) is Islam in its comprehensive, complete and final form. The Quran is the last revealed word of Allah and the basic source of Islamic teachings and laws. The Quran deals with the basis of creeds, morality, history of humanity, worship, knowledge, wisdom, God-man relationship, and human relationship in all aspects. Comprehensive teaching on which, can be built sound systems of social justice, economics, politics, legislation, jurisprudence, law and international relations, are important contents of the Quran. Hadith, the teachings, sayings and actions of Prophet Mohammed (PBUT), meticulously reported and collected by his devoted companions. Explained and elaborated the Quranic verses. THE FUNDAMENTAL ARTICLES OF FAITH IN ISLAM The true faithful Muslim believes in the following Principal articles of faith:- He believes in One God 'Allah', Supreme and Eternal, Infinite and Mighty, Merciful and Compassionate, Creator and Provider. He believes in all Messengers of God without any discrimination among them. Every known nation had a warner or Messenger from God. They were chosen by God to teach mankind and deliver His divine message. The Quran mentions the name of twenty five of them. Among them Mohammad stands as the last Messenger and the crowning glory of the foundation of Prophethood. Muslin believes in all scriptures and revelations of God. They were the guiding light which the Messengers received to show their respected peoples the Right Path of God. In the Quran a special reference is made to the books of Abraham, Moses, David and Jesus. But long before the revelations has been lost or corrupted. The only authentic and complete book of God in existence in the Quran. The true Muslim believes in the Angels of Allah. They are purely spiritual and splendid beings whose nature requires on food, drink or sleep. They spend their days and nights in the worship of God. Muslim believes in the last Day of Judgement. This world will come to an end someday, and the dead will rise to stand for their final and fair trial. People with good records will be generously, rewarded and warmly welcomed to the Heaven of Allah, and those with bad records will be punished and cast into Hell. Muslim believes in the timeless knowledge of God and His power to plan and execute His planes and nothing could happen in His Kingdom against His will. His knowledge and power are in action at all times and command over His creation. He is wise and merciful, and whatever He does must have a meaningful purpose. If this is established in our mind and hearts, we should accept with good faith all that He does, although we may fail to under stand it fully, or think it is bad. THE FIVE PILLARS OF ISLAM Faith without actions arid practice is a dead end, as far as Islam is concerned. Faith by nature is very sensitive and can be most effective. When it is not out of practice or out of use, it quickly loses its liveliness and motivation power. There are five pillars of Islam: The declaration of faith: To bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, and that Mohammad (PBUH) is His Messenger to all human beings till the Day of Judgment. The Prophethood of Mohammad obliges the Muslims to follow, His exemplary life as a model. Prayers: Daily, prayers are offered five times a day as a duty towards Allah. They strengthen and enliven the belief in Allah and inspire man to a higher morality. They purify the heart and prevent temptation towards wrong - doings and evil. Fasting the month of Ramadan. The Muslims during the month of Ramadan not only abstain from food, drink and sexual intercourse from dawn to sunset but also sincerity and devotion. It develops a sound social conscience, patience, unselfishness and will - Power. Zakkah: The literal and simple meaning of Zakkah is purity. The technical meaning of this word designates the annual amount in kind or coin which a Muslim with means must distribute among the rightful beneficiaries.

@krzosu,disc shaped stone can be used if for whatever reason you can't make the disc from the mud/ceramic - i would imagine that stone disc while taking longer to make (initialy) might serve longer/less prone to chipping /damage.  Basically he has shown 2 ways how to make the same part if need be. But if you are asking what is its general function - then in a manner of speaking it's used to store kinetic energy via momentum and using its mass and inertia. which is then later used to rewind the strings that much easier.  Think of it as primitive short term kinetic energy battery of sorts ;],5년 전(수정됨),0,

@عليفيصل-ز9ث,يارب هذا العصر ألحد عندما  سخرت ياربي له دنياكا  علمته من علمك النوويَّ ما  علمته فإذا به عاداكا  ما كاد يطلق للعلا صاروخه  حتى أشاح بوجهه وقلاكا  واغتر حتى ظن أن الكون في  يمنى بني الانسان لا يمناكا  أوما درى الانسان أن جميع ما  وصلت إليه يداه من نعماكا ؟  أو ما درى الانسان أنك لو أردت  لظلت الذرات في مخباكا  لو شئت ياربي هوى صاروخه  أو لو أردت لما أستطاع حراكا  يأيها الانسان مهلا واتئد  واشكر لربك فضل ما أولاكا  واسجد لمولاك القدير فإنما  مستحدثات العلم من مولاكا  الله مازك دون سائر خلقه  وبنعمة العقل البصير حباكا  أفإن هداك بعلمه لعجيبة  تزور عنه وينثني عطفاكا  إن النواة ولكترنات التي  تجري يراها الله حين يراكا  ماكنت تقوى أن تفتت ذرة  منهن لولا الله الذي سواكا  كل العجائب صنعة العقل الذي  هو صنعة الله الذي سواكا  والعقل ليس بمدرك شيئا اذا  مالله لم يكتب له الإدراكا  لله في الآفاق آيات لعل  أقلها هو ما إليه هداكا,7년 전,0,

@zjlrocksl741,"#1: Make Rope Get plant fibre, make it into thin (length depends on you) strands, then pile them up, twist the two ends opposite ways to make it become a thicker strand, fold in half, then flip sides over like close up in video  #2: Add rope to the tools Get Rope. Also get flint and banging rock / wood / hammer. Get small piece of plant fibre Use flint with hammer to get slice in the top, insert rope and then use fibre to tie and secure it.  #3: Use ropes on tools Pull, let go, then the spinning will automatically make it wind back up (if you pull for too long, the stick will stop spinning and nothing will happen!  Hope this helps",7년 전,2,

Пробовал дома делать из зубочисток и стол нормально так дырявит/прожигает. Не знаю может на канале уже показывали её, но если нет то - стоит показать. Она, как и писал выше, очень схожа с этой, но камень не дырявится, а делается углубление которым прижимается палка, вревка натягивается на смычёк, заводится за палку и один раз проворачивается. Дальше прижимая камнем палку - просто елозишь смычком и скорость розжика/сверления поражают.",7년 전,0,

@jordanwright5430,"No. The sticks create friction and start the fire. It's a combination of the spinning stick and the downwards pressure. As heat is created, the end of your stick will get charred and look black. Small bits of this fall off into the hole. They create even more friction, and since already slight charred, ember very well. That's what creates the ""punk"" that you put on your pile of tinder. Nothing else needs to be added or found or anything like that. He added small bits of pebbles when he was drilling the first rock into a flywheel to create more friction and pressure points to break apart the rock and open his hole. Otherwise, you only break apart rock where your big 2 are touching, taking much more time and effort to make a whole.",7년 전,0,

@StormsandSaugeye,"Kill animal, collect fat. Melt the fat and then get lye (There are guides for producing your own lye. Be warned, it's a dangerous substance, so be careful) Mix water and lye carefully (There will be a reaction producing heat. So please please please be careful) Check the temp by resting your gloved hand on the side of the jar. Do not stick your finger in the water! melt your fats separately over low heat. When melted, measure out the tallow and lard into a glass or stainless steel mixing bowl. You want the fats and the water/lye mixture to both be at room temperature. When they are both at room temp, slowly stir the water/lye mixture in to the fats until blended. Using an immersion blender, hand mixer or stand mixer, mix the fat/water/lye combo on low, being careful not to splash. The lye is still active! Continue emulsifying the mixture until is begins to take on the consistency of loose pudding. This is called “trace”, where you lift up a bit of the liquid soap and it leaves a trace as it trails back into the soap.  Since he probably won't do soap, this should be enough to get you started. I'd like to see you try the method sometime!",7년 전,1,

@CyrusBerme,So... using that fly wheel effect is genius.  Observations on your pump drill - perhaps instead of using a rigid stick and pumping with your hands you could use a flexing 'bow' and weight it at the center.  It would almost run itself once you got it started and matched the flywheel force to the weights on the bow.  It would need a rigid outer structure.  Perhaps this could serve as an AC in your shelter using also your clay blower and fan blades.  (I wish I was out there with ya man!),8년 전,0,

@ReaganMors," @RM360CR  Primitive just means being a part of the early stages of something's development. His technology is primitive because he's starting from scratch, going into the woods and making shelter and tools and agriculture using his bare hands and any natural thing he can find. He does have the advantage of not needing to worry about survival, and already knowing a lot about the laws of physics, but he ultimately shows how much you can do in a natural environment with some creativity and experience. That's what I always think when I watch these videos: ""Primitive people must have been so much more creative than modern people. They must have been so much stronger and smarter to have survived out there when I wouldn't last 3 days.""",3년 전,17,

I know from experience.... my hands was badly blistered but everyday I continued to cut the tree's down cause I needed the garden space, a saw would have bee nice but at the time I only had a thick bladed butcher knife to use, I cleared a huge field & my sons ate good from my effort.... where there is a will there is a way....",8년 전,17,

Where as this badass would just go off and build a fucking village. These skills are to this day still extremely vital, not only that but learning these skills I feel would be a vastly humbling experience.

@empteenet,"Exactly. People like Evan Jones show that we need classes like these. It used to be the case in the states that Girl Scouts of America and Boy Scouts of America would teach these skills, or skills similar, but it has become a bit watered down until you get to the higher levels. Also, it was always extra-curricular. Some skills for survival could reconnect us to nature, and may prove quite useful if we have a bad solar flare or other social epidemic that might cause us to need to rebuild technology. Plus, there are many in the world who could teach these skills who are currently underemployed. I think it's a great idea, Knight Jon Artorias.

Also the gyroscopic effect will keep it more stable in the stick axis (don't know if he designed it that way but that's a wanted feature for sure). If he would add a larger rock, the pump needed will be harder due to the large momentum so it's sort of a balance between momentum vs force needed to operate. This is how engine's flywheels operate. Larger wheels add larger momentum and therefore giving more torque at the expense of a lazy reaction engine. Smaller wheels give less momentum, ie less torque, but the engine reacts quickly to throttle inputs.",8년 전,0,

@Dinosaurthingything,"***** proof by me saying this, I am not offended, and your offense is probably caused by me explaining to someone something simple; I had meant to say if you were born 9,534 years ago you should still know this. How i am an idiot by referring to the general populations lack of instinct and knowledge of simple things, like a brittle medium ""hardness"" rock is broken by a stiffer, stronger, as hardness is a more general term, can crack, chisel, drill into, or grind down the other rock (referring to the earlier mentioned stone, which is still metaphorical.) And my profile name is not as simple as my actual one. Mine is meant as a specific original user of any sort of electronic device with a usable interface for entertainment purposes thati specifically enjoy the idea of posting observable entertainment driven audio visual experiences ""played"" by me. The hybrid part is about my infactuation with how hybridized animals react to their enviroment. I happen to also enjoy paleontology, so using that as my format for hybrid creatures, as dinosaurs are still so mysterious, is quite interesting to me. It also depends on what you mean by custom. Did i create it? Yes. Did i consider individuality? Yes. Did i choose something i enjoy? Yes. If this is what you intend as custom, you are very incorrect. And you may think I am using grammar to prove my mental ability to comprehend and use stored information, but no not really. An idiot is someone who is ignorant of their surroundings and environment, not able to concentrate on storing all they have learned in one day, just some of it, and mentally choose, create mental stimulation known as day dreams, and are essentially just lacking in learning or caring. They also may attempt to harm people using speech or visual speech known as text, because they do not understand their purposefully horrible humor as it is intended to just make you laugh at the joke being seen as if someone created it without using intellect. Furthermore, you proven yourself incorrect and possibly even an idiot.

Every high school graduate has more knowledge about mathematics, history and science than the geniuses from hundreds or even thousands of years ago... Yes studies suggest a connection between brain mass and IQ.

Animals, like Ravens, which have similarly but not nearly as great body/brain proportions are notably creative and good at problem solving.

@mahmoudyahya1738,"You people are taking the wrong approach into thinking that primitive man was smart. There are a number of factors that you should consider.  1) people in the wild need fire to make things easier like surviving cold winters easily and eating food faster due to less chewing because cooking makes food soft. The limiting factor was starting a fire. And to start one a guy had to sacrifice a hand full of painful blisters for the tribe. So they needed things like these badly.  2)in real life scenarios, its always a group of people aka tribe that can come up with these solutions. The guy in the video makes it seem so fast and intiuitive and easy. But in fact these technologies probably took a large number of interconnected tribes hundreds or even thousands of years to develop.   3) in a world with limited knowledge, this is the only solution to the problem of starting fires easily. Nowadays these methods are optimized greatly using our knowledge of chemistry and physics into a lighter or even a simple match stick.  4)Recent humans dont have this problem anymore so the brain is focused on finding solutions to current day nagging problems like installing your house solar panels to get free air conditioning or downloading/developing software to automatically manage our day to day small issues from the google play store. Etc. And most of us simply work for people and companies that are providing or  inventing solutions to these current problems. And a few of us are the head of these companies or a small startup.  5)this device is so primitive and easy to come by than you think. Its so easy that its now obsolete and replaced by a lighter or a motorized drill with high quality drill bits made with very smart criteria in place based on physics and mathematics.",5년 전,0,

@ChuckHouse420,"MrPathorn Well considering the modern grid is only slightly more than 100 years thats a silly question. However in the 1870's there was a solar flare that knocked out the telegraph lines. You can read the newspaper articles about the trouble that caused. When it happens again (not if, but when) we will lose most modern cars, GPS, electricity, without electricity many people will not be able to get water, flush toilets, wash clothes, pump gas, heat or cool their homes, refrigerate food. Basically it will be a disaster. And i could happen at anytime. With barely minutes of warning.  EMPs and solar flares are very real threats to our modern way of life.",9년 전,1,
@MrPathorn,"Chuck House Well what I mean in 1000 years ago we have Metal tools, Superior carpentry, Dry field Agriculture. These videos are from things are from like late stone age!!   These videos would help people 1000 years ago ONLY if their civilization falls.   Most of what you said (GPS electricity gas etc) are luxury compared of what human really need to survive. Even if electricity or anything fails we still have government that run without electricity.  This can help if something like apocalypse happens and 99% people died.",9년 전,0,
@MrPathorn,***** Most modern Government have ways to deal with situation when power grid runs out It's not the fucking end of the world!  In most 3rd world countries they still didn't have electricity in every town and they are still a government!  But for America they may be downgraded to the same as those.

@ChuckHouse420,"MrPathorn ""We lived 150 years ago without electricity! Why do you think that it's absense will cause end of humanity?""  I don't think it will be the end of humanity. It will be the end of modern society. And while it would be fairly cheap and simple to insure our electical grid can handle an EMP we have yet to do so on a major scale.

@PyroAssasin573,What is the purpose of the flywheel?,9년 전,0,
@shehreyarky,"From what I understand, a flywheel uses inertia (the tendency of an object to resist change) in order to exert a continuous force even after the application of force has been discontinued. Basically, if you spin something, it's going to keep spinning due to the energy you have imparted as a result of the initial application of force. This is demonstrated in the video when he pulls on the cord and it fully unwinds, then rewinds itself around the stick despite the fact that he has stopped applying force. The circular stone has significant mass, therefore it is resistant to change (i.e. stopping it's rotation). Therefore, he can produce continuous rotation with an application of discontinuous force.",9년 전,2,
@Kanglar,Yep basically what Shehreyar said. It's a way to store mechanical energy. Like on a piston driven engine they are used to smooth out the motion since you only get short bursts of power. On spaceships they are used in the form of control moment gyroscopes to provide torque in space without using any fuel.,9년 전,0,

@Incubator859,"outwestlawns There have been many cases where squatters have lived off in large parks, forests and other government controlled land that have gone undetected and off the grid.  Squatters have been known to take up residence in vacation homes in some remote area in the forest and only leaving the place during summer when the owners go there on vacation or some guys living in cabins totally undetected by forest rangers. Like I said, government is not some omnipotent being that can be everywhere at once.

@OFFICIAL_VIDEO_AWARDS,"+Sniper2008009 I guess you didn't understand what I meant.   Yes I could drive off into the unknown and secretly live playing hide and seek with the Rangers however what I meant was;  You cannot drive into the woods hundreds of kilometers from civilization and build yourself a home. Dig a well and plant a garden.  Once the government finds out, it will be destroyed. You will be fined heavily and/ or incarcerated.   You are legally allowed to be homeless and ""squat"" from place to place but you are not legally allowed to build a home on unoccupied land- even if that land is 3000kms from the nearest town or even an uninhabited island (one of hundreds of thousands scattered off the coast) of most countries.",9년 전,1,
@Incubator859,"outwestlawns I completely understand what you meant. You're just justifying the majority's inability to live in the wild to do so. You're giving excuses. Many people have done it. Some guy in Alaska completely isolated himself, got his own tools, built his own cabin out in the frozen tundras in Alaska and lived in the wild.  Some squatter made a vacation home his residence while hunting and farming and only leaving in summer months. Some guy made his own cabin totally undetected by forest rangers in the wild.  Like I said, government is not some omnipotent force that can be everywhere at once. The only thing stopping people from living in the wild is their inability to do so. Let's be honest, humanity has self-domesticated. We'd rather be docile and live easy  because we made ourselves this way. It's more convenient and not worrisome to think about where to get our next meal and spending hours creating our own equipment and homes with an empty stomach.  Don't blame the government for your inability and lack of balls. You can if you wanted to but you'd rather have some great imagined unbeatable force in your mind that you want to fight but can't win against.

@Morphimus,"The mass of the stone makes it keep rotating even when it's no longer being pulled. It's like spinning a top, it keeps going even when you let go. This rotation spins the ropes back around it the other way, and then they can be pulled again. It's ingenious really.",9년 전,0,
@holohulolo,"Morphimus Ah, right. I was thinking it spins in reverse after the ropes' being extended. So actually it's just drill constantly spinning in 1 direction, but it's the rope that get twisted in the other direction. Thanks",9년 전,0,
@Morphimus,"No no, you misunderstand. It actually does reverse directions.  Change the video to 0.25 speed, and go to around 2:45 (preferably in high quality) Take a look at what's happening here. I'll break it down...  He pulls the stings and it starts to spin. Then, it continues to spin, even when the strings are pulled out all the way, because of the inertia of the rock. Since it' still spinning the same way, it ends up wrapping around the stick again in the other direction. It slows to a stop eventually, with the strings now wrapped around it again. But now it's wrapped the other way, so when he pulls the strings again, the whole thing spins in the opposite direction from the way it spun last time. Then it's pulled all the way out. It keeps spinning, and winds the other way. Then it slows to a stop again. And so on and so on.  It's really a marvelous device when you take a close look at it. The back and forth winding motion reminds me of a yo-yo!",9년 전,1,
@holohulolo,"Morphimus Actually that's exactly what I meant. At first I thought right after the strings are extended to its' full extent, the drill immediately turns in reverse direction.  Since the drill continues spinning after the coil is unwind, it twists  and rewind the ropes, but in opposite direction.   Once the ropes has recoiled around the stick, the person starts pumping down again to unwind it, as the ropes extends outward unwinding the coil, the drill and the stone spins in reverse direction.  I wasn't being clear, I didn't meant the drill spins one direction  al the way even as the person is pumping. What I meant was after it's being pumped down, since the drill continues to spin in that direction, it's starts winding up the ropes again, but in reverse.",9년 전,0,

He also said he went to university and received a Bachelor of Science degree from James Cook University at Cairns Campus but ""didn't do anything with it"",[5] and instead worked stints in soil testing, at a pottery shop, and at a powder-coating factory before mowed lawns for a living while going out into the bush in his spare time to practice his hobby.[3][6] He stated his affinity for subsisting off of nature began at a young age: at 11, he would make huts by a creek behind his house using only natural materials.[5][7][8]",4년 전,0,

Without the rock when he pulls, the string won't respindle it self onto the stick, and so he wouldn't be able to keep pulling it (you can see it spindles clockwise to counter-clockwise after each pull). Remember the pulling motion adds energy to move the rock around, the kinetic energy he transferred to it will be enough for it to keep going around even after the pulled the string. It's the same principle as a Spinning Top toy or a gyroscope, if it didn't have weight to store momentum it would just immediately drop to the side.",9년 전,0,

@Ibarakify,"As per my comments on an earlier vid, nice to see a different take on firestarting from you!  The cord drill was definitely the better of the two, the problem with the pump seemed to be that it was a bit unstable.  As per my prior suggestion, have you tried working a bowdrill yet? It functions relatively similar to the cord drill in practice, and should be far more stable than the pump (because you've got the weight up top).  Cheers.",9년 전,0,

Earlier today I let your videos play and slept in the chair, soothed by the rhythmic knocking, scraping, crackling of fire and of course bird chirping. I later went back to rewatch them. I watched some other survival dude who is talking and doing goofy voices. Not only is his shtick annoying, it takes away the cool parts such as the sounds. In any case, thank you and keep it up :).",9년 전,0,

@primitivepyromaniac5037,"From what I have heard it takes a moderate performance bow of at least 50lbs to safely (haha) take down a feral pig.  Draw weight is not the only factor that determines the effectiveness of a bow. For example, a bow with physically heavier tips would perform better shooting heavy arrows, and vice versa with light arrows. As a rule though, making the bows tips as light as reasonably possible (5 mm is where is stop) is good for performance and hand-shock.   If the draw weight was slightly lower, aim would have to be near-perfect, as a poor shot would only wound and enrage the animal.  A longer bow (to allow a standard ""to face"" draw length) would be a good idea, as this allows the shooter to align their draw arm and shoulder in a straight line with the arrow, therefore making consistent aiming and a smoother release much easier to achieve. Longer bows also usually possess better performance, but I suppose they would not be ideal for thick vegetation, or your stone - based tool kit. ",9년 전,0,
@primitivepyromaniac5037,"A flat bow is the safest design for wood that is not especially strong in tension or compression.  A bow with a deeper cross section (english longbow, kalahari bushmen bows) is efficient if a good, light timber is used (yew, juniper, cypress).  A denser timber (ironbark, spotted gum, osage) can be used, but the bow will have to be made excessively long, light poundage, will be phsically heavier and may not be durable - the wood may begin to fail in tension or compression).   A flat bow solves these problems by spreading the forces over a wider area, therefore reducing the chances of the wood to fail.   For your needs, the length of your bows don't need to more than 1.5m. However, to increase performance, stability, comfort and accuracy, a longer bow would be needed. A man - high bow with a flat cross-section is a necessary design to use if a bow powerful enough to hunt with is desired. ",9년 전,0,

@Abigail-hu5wf,"These aren't survival skills, they're bushcrafting skills. Survival is surviving in hostile wilderness until rescue or escape; bushcraft is living indefinitely as a PART of the wilderness, but not necessarily in hostile regions. They're different skillsets, and require different tools and skills. A survivalist might not be able to live indefinitely, but that's because their goal is to be able to survive in ANY wilderness, including extremely hostile locations. A bushcrafter's goal is essentially to become a part of the wilderness and live out there indefinitely, utterly self-sustainably, but they might specialise only in one kind of terrain because it's actually really hard to learn all the skills you need to live in any terrain indefinitely.   I've lived in both the UK and Australia (I'm in Australia now), and it was incredibly hard for me to make that move because I had to adjust to an entirely new skillset with almost no common ground. None of the medicinal plants I was familiar with live in Australia; all of the woods and stones are different; the climate is VERY different. It's really hard to bushcraft in multiple terrains, but I could easily survive short term in either.",8년 전,0,

@DonDinosaurio,"***** I get your point and where you're comming from. I'll give you now my point of view as an advertising major on how facebook pages freebooting someone else's content is wrong.  Primitive Technology's videos are on a website in which you decide wether or not to watch the video. Your choice on wether to watch it or not is what makes the uploader earn money out of the content. Think about it as a stock photo website. There's tons of pictures available and you decide which one to buy, that desition will get the photographer paid. He did not force you into buying that picture, you decided it on your own.  A Facebook page freebooting a video that will help them get likes and shares will increase their exposure, therefore making the page more valuable. This is known in advertising and marketing as publicity. Basically it means that you have a good enough story that papers and news outlets will talk about it without you asking them to cover the story. That will make you save a ton of money, often millions on advertising. So, by freebooting videos like this one, a page will save a ton of money on advertising off of a single person's hard work. It differs from pirating a movie you will watch in your living room because you won't profit from it.  Again, I get the point you're trying to get across, but it is an entirely different situation.",9년 전,1,

You can use those for cutting away clay from the sides of cliffs and for breaking through a foot or so of soil, but not much more than that. The easiest way to dig deeper or through tougher material is to make a sort of stone mattok: kinda like a mix between a hoe and a pickaxe.

But I don't mean doing that again.. and going from flywheel to teslawheel. I mean a whole new way of survival like using our own ability. This looking at our forefathers shows that we are reflecting and accepting it as a part of who we were and respecting that instead of saying dumb neanderthal. That's what I meant with that we are closing this chapter of survival with using our smarts with tools(and modern tools). It could be a sign that we are looking for a new kind of survival. Catching my drift?  Mulinaster Not spacetravel indeed but something profoundly different. Computers with consciousness is a bit more about what I'm thinking but a computer is still a tool you see? Our consciousness is build upon eachother and so is our mechanics but the humanbeing is possibly heading towards a new type and we are in the midst of closing there are still a lot of remnants of this way, but that's just how I view it.",9년 전,0,

@vincentliuo,+roosterwallace28 I dont agree. It is the point to life rather... and from that you get multiple layers of points.

@jonahgaff,+Mulinaster the very fact that there is no go back to technology is the simplest fact that suggests that we need to preserve old technology this video demonstrates  this very action Ameri many more people like him constantly posting videos about primitive way it is important to keep old technology so that if our current technology is ever thrown back to the Stone Age we can simply jump back a step,9년 전,1,

@mistercrankypants,"+Mulinaster Not at all. Did the laws of physics close? Did our species' behavior of observing the natural world and reflecting and being innovative close? Now we're using the technology gained to examine the processes which lead us here. There are countless things to be learned. To name but a few: How our mind's work. What do we know today about that old technology? Is it ironic that most people of today couldn't survive in that world? How one makes fire without anything but the resources at hand is both: at the epicenter of a gigantic leap in the progression of the species, and an important thing to be able to do that could save one's life in the wilderness.  Plus it's really Goddamned interesting.  Don't be so quick to try to shut someone down and open your eyes. Get rid of that ""we're here now, so who cares"" attitude because a comet could smash into the planet at any time and put us right back there.

That I know exactly what end state youre trying to reach with each experiment despite the fact that you say absolutely nothing during filming and I only read the description afterward speaks to how fantastic a presenter you are. Hand gestures, motions, spot on camera work, only necessary editing for the sake of time (days and months). Its all very emotional without being preachy or dramatic.  I find myself projecting my thoughts onto your actions, narrating the procedures as if I was experimenting with the concepts myself through the screen, only to feel elated when I see the concept realized in its function.  Finally something else your videos do that others dont. They imbue in me a sense of great appreciation of the power of complex thought. Understanding that while everything you do takes an extreme amount of time and practice, you make it look inviting in its difficulty. More of a reason to experience than a task to complete.   Suffice it to say ive learned more watching your ""silent protagonist"" routine than I have watching anything else where the opinions and beliefs of the practitioner come to the forefront.

They walk 8 hours each day to get back a couple of jugs of water. How can they do other things like learn modern education when they spend the whole day walking. The point of getting water sources like wells to Africa is to let the kids have an ability to go to school instead of getting water.

I bet that by yourself, you almost have a negligible impact on evolution. So why some societies move forward and others don't, well mostly because they have some values and interests that others don't. Luckily all the world cultures are not the same, and they all share advantages and disadvantages. Some prefer conquest, and others don't. Etc...   Here Maasaïs: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Kenyan_man_2.jpg/250px-Kenyan_man_2.jpg . Those are warriors and they are used to chase lions (and they have awesome art and clothing, really they have great taste on that). You have other cultures there that are used to take as little as possible despite the fact that they own very little and that their lands offer very little, Etc.. The more your learn about History, and the more you see human marvels. Sure europeans managed to take advantage of the last centuries, but mankind is not bounded by the last two thousands years.  You can take example on the japanese, they used to live like in the middle age until very late.Then they fast switched to europe standards and became rapidly up-to-date, way faster than any european or american country (you can see how the East Europe is very slowly leaving communism, huge issues there. People are very hard to change their culture and behaviors in Europpe and America).  I am sure people of Africa will show us great things in the future. Here in Paris, we have a nice museum of african art, with some very unusual objects, not only the usual african masks. I can see those cultures providing the world great things. In the modern era, they already invented the blues, mastered jazz, which are the roots of a great part of contemporary music, etc...

I heard tell that you are moving on to smelting and creating bows; I would love to see you continue to move down the technology line to a point where you are able to craft a metal tool.  On a different note, do you think you could have doubled your tile output in your tiled hut video by building two  furnaces? I can't tell if you could have tended to two or not. And would it have been worth the time to build another?  It really makes me appreciate how much a community would be able to benefit from specialization; a tile worker and a wall builder would be able to create many such huts (or even larger ones) compared to having to go it all yourself.

@witherfang1368,The drill was a native American design I'm pretty sure,4년 전,0,
@audiosreality," @witherfang1368  actually no look up the rebuild of the antikythera mechanism. Most ""native americans"" used ""bow"" drills. judging by the amounts of holding stones laying around the great plains. Honestly and this isn't any slight of any cultures the technological gap between the meso americans and the northern peoples was broad but not as broad as the gap between the america's and places like Australia and the asia/ mediteranian / north african/ India / european continents. Meso america was about equal to the ancient egyptians in development only about 4500 years later. Given they hadn't had the exposure to trade from far away cultures like those on the land connected parts and lacking beasts of burden this was understandable. The ""Great Plains"" was fairly unsettled because of 2 very important factors low access to agriculture and the weight of housing. A plains Teepee weighs about 900 pds. without the horse and its widespread use by north americans most of the ""plains peoples"" were tied to the river systems. Lacking the domesticated animals agriculture was man powered meaning the lack of ""free time"" and spare food needed to support an artesian class in the population. Had the Americas remained in isolation its development would have continued although still slower than the rest of the world because of the lack of anything larger and stronger than a llama. Likely the rivercraft and watercraft would have seen an amazing jump as metalwork was expanded but agriculture wouldn't have without an animal as strong as an ox. The native america's developement wasn't hampered by anything they did nor were they lacking anything different than any other peoples except 2 very key things in civilization draught animals and the free time they provide.  Eventually Llamas may have led to the development of wheeled transport and very small plows but their only able to haul around 80pds tops. A mini horse can draw about 200 pds. A single draft 8000pds. Basically the visual would be farming and equipment from 1910 vrs 2021.",4년 전,0,

It's what makes the whole thing work.   I believe this is called inertia but don't quote me on that, I never learned no smart people sciences.",9년 전,3,
@Cakemagic1,"+Cakraization I also have no degree in physics or something, but from what I can tell, the rock has multiple purposes. Like some people said, momentum and inertia, but balance is indeed also an important factor. If you pull the ropes without the weight down there, the stick will just go all over the place, as opposed staying vertical like that and spin.  It's a bit similar to how well you can spin a top as opposed to just a pencil.",9년 전,3,
@NobodyEvenReadsNames,"+cakemagic lol  yep. not to mention the weight of the rock creates a strong downwards force, which assists in creating the holes. without the rock, you would have to manually push the end of the drill down, which would also cause it to wobble (which would make drilling the hole much more frustrating, since you'd be falling out of it every few seconds).",9년 전,4,

@TheTribeOfBenjamin,"+Primitive Technology This is very cool, thanks for sharing that with me! It sounds like it is a pretty hard wood if it gave your celt a run for its money. It makes me a little said inside thinking about your chipped blade...glad you could rework it! Bow making is a constant learning process because every wood species has it's own personality. Once you get use to following a few basic bow principles, you will be able to coax more and more staves into nice shooting tools. Have fun with it and don't let some broken ones discourage you. Having said that, you should be able to get a decent amount of draw length out of a 1.5 m long bow.  If you make a bend through the handle bow, you can maximize that bows bending potential. You have good thickness to work with at 5 cm. I am a big believer in allowing the wood to fully harden before finishing. It would be really interesting to see a string made from bark....I imagine you have some really tough bark down your way! Sounds like a lot of fun stuff. I hope you find your bow project to be very rewarding!...Keep me posted!....Ben",9년 전,0,

I was wondering whether you have tried to use the fire stick and hearth method but instead of moving your hands from the top to the bottom, move your hands so they stay in one place most of the time? I have tried it with an old stick indoors, but have never and could never start a fire especially with the method I mention here. Some I have seen seem to move more slowly and do manage it, it is easier on the shoulders and arms but is something that is counterintuitive, so you need to think about it all the time?   I just love watching the quiet and always hard work you put into ALL your videos, as I guess you want to show things the way it would be if there was zero ‘modern world?’  Take care mrbluenun",9년 전,0,

You can live off it, for now, but you keep having a creeping feeling that they could dry up at anytime due to forces out of your control. You need to have a reliable, clean source of water, in large quantities, with minimal effort. All around you lies an ocean.

@aserta,"I wonder if they used the sapling method in that time period.  Explanation: You need two saplings either pushed in the ground or naturally close, i'd say within 3 or 4 feet of each other.  A piece of rope is tied between them, then, a fire stick is looped around (like the bow method) in the center. Using a rock the fire stick is pushed down in the usual manner and when the fire starter is pushing on one of the saplings the rope is rotating the fire stick.  I've seen this demonstrated in an old, French survival book. To me, the method seems very, very intuitive to that period. Reason being that they used traps, so they knew of the spring power and, they used the bow method.  With the much more simpler mind of then, putting 1 and 1 together to get 2 is relatively easy.

@Whoozerdaddy,"Very cool, always love watching these videos. Question, did you ever experiment, when drilling through stone, with using a little water in the hole to make a stone slurry to help with the abrasion of the stone?  Also, for mounting your bits in the spindle, would it be practical to make a collet type attachment so you could pre-mount your bits in a short piece of wood, then when they got dull or chipped, pull them out and replace them? The spindle would be split and hollowed at the end to allow the pre-mounted bits to be inserted. Slipping a small disc of drilled wood down over the spindle and forcing it onto the leaves of the collet would hold the bit in place. You know your local woods, so maybe one of them would have the resilience of something like a North American elm that would allow you to do that.",9년 전,0,

@johnlord8337,"10*  These ancestors were more genius than we are today.  Today - I would go to hardware store.  Go to steel washers and find  big a--ed 3+ inch washer.  Go to the wooden dowels, and use the washer's inner diameter find the needed diameter wood dowel.  Select the desired dowel diameter and length for a pump drill wood bow.  Then go get a small hank of braided cord.  Go to the 1x4 pine boards, and select.  In this, make circle cuts with knife around the flywheel area, the thickness of the steel washer.  Make vertical slices down to this cut line, above and below these double lines.  Make slight peeling of the dowel surface as a wooden star washer design.  Slide on the washer and press into the uncut washer thickness surface.  It should be held snug.  Cut the drill to desired length.  Blunt the drill tip, and sharpen the drill top.  Cut down an ""X"" notch into the drill top 1 inch deep.  Place the cord center through the X and cross wrap around the X and tie off.  Cut an ""X"" notch at both ends of the pump drill bow.  Make knots at each end of the rope, and wrap around the pump drill bow.  Easy.  A total pump drill and fire board unit.",9년 전,0,

@Mystickneon,"+Phyrexious The idea of a flywheel is to preserve momentum(force) after torque is removed... in order to do that, you need moving mass, and the more mass that you have, the more momentum is preserved. A flywheel made of a denser material can be made smaller(mass*velocity) to achieve the same effect. So a wooden flywheel is certainly feasible, but it would need to be larger in order to achieve the same results of a flywheel made of stone(fired clay in this case), or even metal.",9년 전,4,

@jeramiahhurkmans5678,"+scyther1 have you watched survivor man? i like that guy. i met him once, not privately, but we talked for a minute or two. he goes out with few materials( which he displays in the beginning of the how so he isnt just pulling out random things) and he films his own show. he has afew cameras which he uses to film what he does, and if he doesnt make it, then people come looking for him after a few weeks and in which time he could have easily died.",9년 전,3,
@jeramiahhurkmans5678,"+fgdfghsfg dude, bear grylls is fake. he can leave anytime he wants, he can get ahold of anything he wants. there have been photographs taken of him on break during the show eating a hot meal with his crew. and he isnt ex-SAS or ex-French foreign legion. some idiot claimed that he was awhile ago and has since been disproven. hes not a bad guy, but hes not that extreme. he just has extensive survival training. i have 5 years survival training, 2 years first responders training, and 8 years emergency response training. im not saying im better than him but give me a camera and some gear and i can go out and do the same thing",9년 전,2,

The guy's service was cut short due to a parachuting accident, breaking 3 vertebrae. Just being able to pass the selection process makes Grylls a certified bad ass in my book.
