@Kordellcabe12,Lebron’s block is the most overrated play in NBA history. I mean it’s a great play but the only reason it’s hyped up the way it is is because he doesn’t have a shot on the level of his skill. Like he’s great but his teammates are the ones with the iconic shots. (Allen and Kyrie),3년 전,0,

@edenalexandriab9120,"Keep strong. Dont forget that despite the evil in this world, God is full of justice, mercy and love.   Justice said we broke His perfect law - causing the world's previous perfection to be destroyed - and therefore we deserve Hell (like a punishment in any legal system but this is eternal as His perfect law is eternal too). Don't think you fit in that category? Ever done one of these?: lying, stealing - regardless of how small the object EVER, hating others - which is murder in God's perfect law, lusting (plus God sees our entire thought life). Justice says ""the soul that sins shall die"". BUT, mercy said ""I dont want to give them what they deserve. I don't want them to be cut off from Me. I love them despite all they have done/will do against Me. I want to give My children another chance. I want them to come home and live in My love again"".   And love said ""Jesus, God's Son, came down as a Man, our representative, suffering every temptation, pain and struggle we have ever faced, yet without sin. He took all our sins (past/present/ even future) to the cross and then crucified EVERY ONE on our behalf. Justice was paid on the cross so that we can be free from Hell's punishment, experience Gods mercy of forgiveness of sin and live in His love. If we turn from the sins we have committed and repent (turn away from our sin and pursue the opposite direction of love through Christ) He will, overtime, recreate us back into that previously perfect image through The Holy Spirit which Jesus sends to all who accept Him as their personal Lord and Savior of their life.  He is in Heaven right now preparing a place for us so that He can take His faithful, believing children home with Him when He returns. He will ressurrect us from death when He returns, giving mercy to those who accept His love, instruction and teachings in their life, and give justice to those who refuse it.  He doesn't want ANY of us to go to Hell and die for continuing in evil and rejecting His way to life, thats why He died FOR us. He wants us to be His and begin to follow His life of love and service through Him (not ourselves as it's impossible without depending on His power and instruction). So long as we keep our hearts near to Christ through His strength, strive to obey His will of perfect love revealed in the Bible, and ask Him to help us in the midst of (very certain) pitfalls and struggles, we will, in time, win the victory over sin, pain and DEATH through Christ. Even if you are willing to be made willing, or struggling or doubtful, simply be honest and tell Him that. He hears and will answer. If we pray for Him to come in then He will.  NOTE: You are NEVER too sinful or messed up that God cannot turn your life around through Jesus. EVER.  If you have any questions let me know!",4년 전,0,

@נמרודנמרוד-ת9י,"Why is love according to the method of the ""baal hasulam"" The wisdom of Kabbalah,  is the solution to all troubles for humanity? Because all nature is a force, a feature, a system, a formula of love.  Of connection and unity between opposites, between hot and cold, hard to soft, white and black, male and female, sweet and bitter, light and dark.  In every atom and particle, in every inanimate plant and life, the whole universe and beyond, the whole reality is the result of a connection between opposites.  For humanity and the individual, one power rules from the day of birth, hatred of others and self-love at its expense, egoism.  By combining the power of love with the equation, man maintains the connection between the opposites and thus stops resisting nature, and enters into harmony with it, which is the goal of nature, to do good to creatures.  Until then, man will suffer great and immense suffering in order to recognize and submit to the demand of nature, He must strive in his power and choice in loving others. Thus he will acquire intellect and wisdom to connect the two opposites and will complete the nature that was created with unintentional intent, but rather man must complete it, and manage it, and bring it to perfection.  And why did nature do that? (Nature and God are the same gematria 86)  In order for man to grow and develop in his free choice and thus conduct creation as the conductor of an orchestra,   And if man had been created in advance corrected and perfected?  So he was like a perfect animal, dog and cat. But their rank as a robot is controlled with no free choice but absolute instinct dominates them.   After all, a real benefit from a father to his son is nothing but that the son rises and grows according to the rank of his father and even above him. We were to conquer nature just like the one who created it. And not when judging and living a dog and a cat.  If so the solution Is not in increasing the hatred from which it is not lacking and will never be lacking because that is how it has been imprinted on us from the day of birth (Media you do a very bad job just a pity a lot of beatings along the way !!!!)  Nor in the abolition of hatred because it is power is in nature and should not be abolished.  But only in the addition of love and connection and oneness addition upon addition while being aware of the process.  The people of Israel will wake up !!! Followed by the whole world !!!!!  Nature (G-d) requires connection and oneness and if not, he has every means to educate man and humanity until his surrender.  He will not rest or sleep until the purpose of creation is completed. To do good to creatures. Come, O Bnei Yisrael, you are the first to realize this study !!!!!!!! And when you know, you will teach your brothers the peoples of the world.  This is called light to the Gentiles.  And this is a job we do not deserve at all in the meantime.  ""For my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples!""  Love friends only love. It is the solution for every individual and for everyone together.  how?  To do propaganda of connection and not of separation and hatred ....",5년 전,2,

The true top 5 plays of the decade are:  #1 Kyrie's shot #2 Allen's shot  #3 Kawhi's shot (only game 7 buzzer beater in NBA history!)  ...you could swap these 3  #4 Lillards shot (on George) #5 there are a bunch you could put here. Maybe Lillard's other shot.  Again, Lebron was on the list about 50x and 90% of those plays were a joke.   His block was actually a goaltend too.  His playoff game winning shots probably belonged higher on the list though.  P.S. That behind the head shot that took less than 0.3 seconds to release has to be the fastest release I've seen in my 40+ years of watching NBA basketball.

A wide open Kevin Durant 3 to seal a seal a series that was already a total blowout is somehow better than 50 other plays including a Blake Griffin spinning block, or a Tyreek Hill half court heave? Also, most dunks are no where near as impressive as buzzer beaters. Dunks happen 10 to 20 times a game in literally every game. Yet, somehow they rank them after crazy buzzer beater shots that were lucky to see once in a lifetime. This is the same shit you see on sportscenter too nowadays. They’ll give you some easy ass, wide open, fast break dunk over an actual really incredibly difficult play. Jamal Crawfords wide open, mid air, through the legs pass for a Blake Griffin, alley oop, slam is number 34!! How the fuck is that better than any of the plays on this list?

@LennieNelson55,"It's so tough to compare those top two plays. My gut reaction is that The Block is the better of the two, and that with time it will only increase in magnitude and significance. The Block was in a game 7 and prevented the title clinching bucket for the best regular season team of all time. It's also (possibly) basketball's greatest player in his finest moment ever, that capped off his best stretch of performances, and his most impressive title victory.  But in defense of Ray's 3, it forced an overtime that turned into back to back wins, clinching the series for the Heat. It prevented their elimination and allowed them to win back to back titles. In terms of quality of play, that 2013 Finals was some of the best basketball i've ever seen. Writers and players have said that series was the peak of basketball perfection in terms of style, execution, talent, and mastery. The Spurs and Heat each had 4 Hall of Famers on the floor for the shot. In comparison, the 2016 Finals was super sloppy and ugly to watch. At the end of game 7 there was a stretch of about 5 minutes where no one scored.  It's close but I'd put The Block first.",5년 전(수정됨),1,

(I’m thinking it may have been a glitch in the game, cuz the reporter walks onto the court early too, while the Kings are inbounding.)  [also... just as a side-note...

Wade to come out of retirement to help me and I am also working on trading Kuzma for Kyrie. I am also bringing Andre Igiudala to come play D on Kawhi so I can beat him.

Not to mention the Cavs completed the 1st comeback from a 3-1 deficit in Finals history while also winning Cleveland it's 1st championship in 50+ years. Kyrie's shot and Lebron's block literally made history. While Allen's shot simply forced a game 7. And Kawhi's shot won a playoff series. Yes both shots led to titles.

@RealCozyFiction,"Lin was amazing from Nicks, Lakers and Rockets.. Linsanity was destroyed because of Melo's bitchy ass. He was amazing in LA with a career high in 3pt % and PER. He was decent on the rockets at first but when Harden developed into a superstar, Lin just became a play maker not an all around player. Not to mention his above average stats in Brooklyn even tho he got injured. At Atlanta he carries the team when Trae was still trash in his firts 30 games. He a good role player in the Raptors but didn't trusted him when it comes to the play offs because he was new to the team and didn't have that much of a chemistry with kawhi and green so he can't really help facilitating. And don't forget that Nurse actually considered putting Lin over FVV in the play offs after the loss in Philly. But then he got over shadowed by FVV's clutch performance after the loss so Lin didn't played in the playoffs. He's an above average player. He's not trash.

But, the Spurs couldn’t hit crucial free throws down the stretch and Ginobili was awful during the series. Once Bosh got that rebound and gave it to Allen to hit the clutch three, it looked like fate had completely reversed.   That 2013 Heat team is one of the greatest teams I’ve seen play.

@VantagePoint2,"Nope, the Dame shot vs the Rockets was way better than the one vs OKC. First the rockets where up by two points and would have won if Dame missed, forcing a game 7. The game vs the thunder it was a tie, if Damian missed it would go to overtime. The thunder could only force a game 6 when the rockets could force a game 7. Also, the original play for the rockets play was a inbound to Aldridge and get the easy put in. However dame took control of the team and demands the ball, that’s why he is clapping on the inbound. In the okc game it was a designed play for him. It shows real talent and confidence to go against coach’s play and believe you can make the shot. Also the pressure of the Rockets game was miles higher, if he misses there is a game 7 in HOUSTON. OKC, he misses they go to overtime. No pressure to win the game. In OKC as well, that was a bad shot, PG13 and Damian both admitted that it was not a great shot, it went in with a touch of luck. The OKC shot and the rockets shot should trade spots on the list. The Rockets was much more clutch and showed what a shooter like Damian could do. That’s the end of my rant",5년 전(수정됨),1,

@trentmcdowell3361,"Jesus Loves U. Jesus is our Lord and Savior, the Messiah, and the one true God who created us all. And even know we are sinners and we all fall short of the glory of God, he Loves us so much that he came in the flesh as Jesus to die for our sins to be washed away so we could make it to Heaven. The word of God says we can be forgiven for our sins, saved, and go to Heaven but we have to do these things.  Believe in Jesus. Accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior. Repent from our sins. Get baptized in the name of Jesus. Follow Jesus. Have a deep relationship with Jesus. Love everyone. Forgive others. Obey God's commandments. Speak the word of God to the world.  Do the Lord's will until the end.  U dont have to perfect cause U never will be. U are only human. God has so many commandnents its 613 of them and its impossible to obey all of them all the time. Thats tje whole reason Jesus came and died for our sins to be washed away cause he knows we cant be perfect. We are doomed to Hell without Jesus thats why we need him. God jus wants U to try your hardest to do everything he wants U to do. He jus wants U to have a deep relationship with him where U pray to him everyday and talk to him, be honest with him, confess your sins, ask for forgiveness of your sins, ask him to help U not sin, tell him how U feel, tell him what U want, tell him what U need, ask him to help U with whatever U need help with, thank him for everything, and praise him. And he jus wants U to do his will fir your life which is tell people about Jesus, speak the word of God to people, lead people to Jesus, and save souls.   If U call on Jesus, turn from your sins, and follow him then he will save U. He will change your whole life, change U as a person, and make U new. He will take away your depression, anger, pain, stress, and worries, and he will give U peace, joy, strength,  courage, and happiness.  He will set U free from things. He will protect U. He will help U thru anything that U are going thru. He will help U to overcome anything. He will show U the truth about things, reaveal things to U, give U wisdom, give U knowledge, and lead U. And he will bless U.   God has plans for your life that our greater than your own plans for your life. And everybody has a purpose abd your true purpose in life is to walk with Jesus, Love everyone, and lead others to Jesus. Jesus is always there for U, he is always wit U, and God will never abandon U. God wants U trust him. God is control, everything happens for a reason, and God makes everything workout for your own good.   And U dont have to go to church cause Jesus never commanded us to go to church. Jesus set his church up on a rock with his disciples. And we are suppose to be disciples of the Lord abd are body is the temple of God and a temple is a church. The Holy Spirit or the spirit of God lives in those who believe in Jesus so we are the church not a building. Church buildings are jus places that U can go to praise God, have fellowship with others, and learn the word of God. Most churches dont speak the full truth of the Bible tho, most preachers are preaching false doctrines. They dont tell U what U really gotta do to make it to Heaven which is save souls. They say jus believe in Jesus but Jesus said that our faith is dead without works. Jesus said if Love me keep my commandnents. So U show Jesus U Love him with your actions. Jesus said not to follow religion. Jesus said to follow him. Christianity has all these different religions inside one religion and they are all making their own interpretations of the Bible when God's word is simple abd easy to understand. The Ronans even took several books out the original Hebrew Bible.  Satan is controlling religion thats why there are so many different religions cause he is trying to confuse people and they will be lost. Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life and he is the only way to Heaven. Jesus is the word so the word of God is the truth and we suppose to go exactly off what the word of God says.   Satan is trying to control everything on Earth like the governments, hollywood, movies, TV, radio, media, news, economy, schools, science community, drug trade, and even religion. Satan, the other fallen angels, and the Illuminati which is 13 bloodlines of the richest familes in the world, Satanic Cults, and the Free Mason brotherhood are people who have sold their soul to the Devil for fortune, power, and fame and are helping Satan control these things and try to lead U away from God, to sin, to disobey God, to get cursed, and to burn in Hell. They  poision are food, water, and medicine. They are creating a One World Government where Satan will come as the AntiChrist claiming he is Jesus and will be the ruler of the Earth and will try to make people take the mark of the beast 666 abd it will be a chip in your forearm or forehead and if U take it U will go to Hell when U die.   Dont follow the world follow Jesus.",5년 전,0,

@assibeysteven4033,"17ballislife  It’s not. I think it deserves it’s place because of the context 2 years prior to that dunk. Lebron was cooked by Jason Terry in all the games of the 2011 Finals. It got even when Jason Terry was like ‘Lebron can’t guard me’ going into 6 and of the series and Finished in 27 in 32 minutes. In Short, he was right and he cooked Lebron.    2 years later, Terry isn’t as good as Lebron has become and does not have DeShawn Stevenson and Jason Kidd to help Guard Lebron in swarming triple teams. Lebron and his 3 friends then isolate Terry as he’s the only one back on defense, dunk on him and look down at him. ‘This is payback, this is revenge. This is for the crap you said.’ That was Lebron James at his absolute  most petty. And I loved every moment of it.",5년 전,0,

Nobody gave a shit about finals record until Lebron's became something they could criticize, despite 3 losses coming from one of the best teams of all time and easily the best team of the 2010s in the Warriors. Of LeBron's 9 finals, he has only lost 2 where his team were favored, 2011 against the Mavs and 2014 against the Spurs. Every other time he was the heavy underdog or they won. This doesn't even mention how historic the 2016 win in Cleveland was and how it's likely we'll never see an ""against the odds"" win like that ever again, or playoff performances like that in the finals ever again. Sure if you don't care about basketball history, never watched the game, and aren't really a fan, 3-6 is all you need to know. But no real basketball fan would take you seriously.",5년 전(수정됨),7,

It doesn't mean he didn't lift the team in other ways, but playing wise, he wasn't apart of it. You clearly don't know basketball. You used some dumb sarcastic comparison of ""coaching doesn't matter,  guys who don't play defense are stars"" which is so fucking dumb. Nick Nurse put in the most work out of them all, on and off the court. His contribution merits him WINNING a ring. And guys who don't play defense are stars?
