@lovatocrvero742,"Imo Graham Norton is the best talk Show with Conan O'brien and Craig Freguson in terms of Fun and pleasure to watch not ratings....when you watch any of these above mentioned shows you just know its free and easy going and not  really scripted and Guests are Comfortable too and the Host always tries to make a genuine conversation about life and not just movie promotion.....Unlike some Talk show where its not even a talk show cause they start doings these stupid Gimmicks,Games,etc etc which no one asked for.....likes its not a kids shows, its a talk show where the host is suppose to talk to the  Guest just like how any normal person/friends would, first they catch up to what they have been upto(celebs will mention their current movies) and then they talk about some funny story they had on set or private life and then from there its where the road takes us",3개월 전,0,

@kingashmusic,"An opinion:  Graham Norton is one of the best, if not the best to host. Leaving the details of his show aside, he brings a certain energy to his show which allows for natural emotion and stories to take place. People are encouraged to be themselves, and Norton rarely, if ever, interrupts his guests, and on top of that, he understands comedic timing, and is generally polite and respectable to the people who come on his show, and extends that same energy towards his guests.  Conan did not come across as arrogant, and he slowly but surely evolved as his own process went along. By the end, he even removed the desk and started to get more personal with people. He is a funny guy, and is a good host, but unlike Graham Norton, he is as much a part of the show as anyone else, but he is not above degrading himself, and I believe this also is contributed by his very funny remotes he has done.  Colbert is a good host as well - and much like Jon Stewart, is respectable and can diffuse situations with grace and humor. He doesn't come across as arrogant, and is often unwilling to accept praise. His limitations come from the format of his show, and can across as rather pedantic and slow, but its appeal is in its familiarity and comfort.   Here is where we cross over.   Bill Maher is arrogant. However, he is intelligent, and more than willing to have different perspectives on the show, and his own audience will abandon him or boo him at times. He gets respect for not trying to be popular, and backing up his opinions, but he often interrupts his guests, and certainly has an ego.  Both Jimmy Fallon & Kimmel are unfunny and rather unprofessional. Both embarrass their guests, with Fallon embarrassing himself often as well. Kimmel insults his guests at times, while Fallon is fake with everyone, and neither of them broach anything worth remembering.  Lastly, James. G. Is as unfunny as he is ridiculous. His show might have the least substance of all.   Anyway, I know there are others that are either on the air or have been off for awhile such as Jon Stewart and Ferguson or Carson, etc, but other than Stewart, who was class - I haven't seen too much of them, so I can't properly pose an argument.",3년 전,0,

I know that in either 2018 or 2019 Frank Marshall one of the producers of the 5 Bourne movies so far said that he was hopeful of definitely making a 6th and maybe even another but that things were seriously behind schedule and that it may take a few years before they could finally get to grips with it.  He hoped that Matt Damon would be willing to carry on with or without Paul Greengrass as director but if not then he was meaning to try and get someone.  However things have gone ominously quiet over the subject matter this year and the word is that John Wick played by Keanu Reeves is being talked about more and many people are seeing that as the replacement for Bourne.

GNS is the best coz the celebrities r always engaging, there's music at the end and he interviews the musician as well which I've never seen on any talks shows yet, and Graham takes so much efforts as to dig deep thru his guest's pasts to make the evening more fun and entertaining..... Graham interviews 3 or 4 celebrities at a time and they all interact together which is more fun to watch and the audience r just so awesome, I don't think there r boards or signs making them do that, I think GNS audience laugh and react naturally to watever happens thas wat makes it even more special.......",4년 전,0,

The main thing though is completely his personality you can give Jimmy the format but the way Graham banters with the guests makes them feel at ease and the guests usually leave with a big smile,5년 전,0,

Afew weeks later i get text from one of those members telling me that they've won 2nd place and they'd like me to join them moving on to the n3xt stage i said no but i was extremely upset that they thought we were still in talking terms amd i hated myself for beunh polite to them abt it. I tried to let it go and forget the whole thing but it kept bothering me so I decided I'd text them amd tell them exactly what i thought of them. They called emotional and unprofessional. I'm even more upset right now and if i could i would take back re-openning the conversation. and idk what to do. I was never this angry in my life i wamt to cry amd scream amd yell but i can't do those things i hope that writing it here makes me feel better.

Chris's brother, Luke plays Thor & Chris (who is extremely good friends with Matt Damon) had Matt Damon come do a cameo as the actor who portrays Loki in the play. It was just a cameo & it's hilarious. That's what I was referencing. Watch it here: https://twitter.com/HiddlesPage/status/971634280941211649?s=19  Also, on a sidenote, Matt also played fallen angel Loki in the 1999 Kevin Smith film Dogma.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@RiamsWorld,"@J It might be considered creepy, depending on how aggressive they are, but for the most part, not sexist. Buzzfeed has done some female celebrity thirst tweet segments that didn't run into those issues: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlz1eUL4mKw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wngre-pWblk It definitely works out better when the tweeter is saying something they want/would let the celebrity to do to them, not something they'd do to the celebrity, at which point it can become creepy. Women are given more leeway in that regard because society doesn't see them as threatening or strong enough to cause harm (and men are more assumed to be receptive of sex from anyone female). Gay men thirst tweeting straight male celebrities would likely be seen as just as creepy as straight men tweeting female celebrities, but lesbians thirst tweeting straight female celebrities likely wouldn't be seen as creepy.",4년 전(수정됨),1,

Nothing wrong with the hosts either, but if I'm watching an interview of an actor I like, I'm watching it for the actor, and I wanna hear him/her talk, not the host interrupting and trying to be funny every 10 seconds.  Besides, the whole ""the show should revolve around me, the host"" seems a little too self-centered and egotistical. Graham lets the spotlight shine on the guests, and it is thanks to this show that I've come to actually know anything interesting about the guest celebrities.  And this reflects on the topics of conversation too. Graham clearly does his research on every guest and asks actually interesting questions, while, for example, Conan (as funny as I think he is) asking Nina Dobrev about her dress was the thing that made me get away from American chat shows for good.",7년 전,268,
@SophieMia806," @miaferrari958  ... I agree with basically everything you just wrote. Except I've never watched Conan's show. But I WAS thinking of Stephen Colbert when you were talking about self-centered. I used to enjoy watching his show sometimes. Then, before the 2016 Presidential election, all he seemed to talk about in his monologues, and still does from the commercials I see, was (and is) Donald Trump. I don't like Trump (in general), and I want to watch the show for the guests, and hear monologue jokes about other stuff aside from his stupid impressions of the President. Once in a while I can understand. But by the time I stopped watching, it was every single night. Basically his whole monologue, each night, was Trump this, Trump that. And with his guests, he does the same thing you wrote about. It's all about the host, and not the guests. It's tiring.",7년 전,52,

@randomobserver8168,"Back in the day someone wrote that Leno did a talk show with a bit of comedy, Letterman did a comedy show that happened to have guests, and that rang true for me, but you're right- both those men and most of their successors took the American talk show in a direction more comedy and host focused and less about the guests, enabled by the format of having one guest at a time. It's not necessarily bad, but it foregrounds the host even more and minimizes guest interaction in favor of one on one. You don't get the kind of thing Graham creates every time. At best, you get the quirky, funny one on one stuff Craig Ferguson did.",4년 전,0,
@cpetrizzi,"Full disclosure, I'm in the US and feel that talk show hosts interject themselves into the conversation WAY too much. As if they are as important as the guest. They are in no way important, and that's Graham's genius. He lets the guests take over and guide the conversation as a host should. I'm envious that we don't have anyone like him here in the States.

@AnnoDomini2690,"Al-Wala’ Wal-Bara requires Muslims love all other Muslims, to help Muslims against non-Muslims (this would include sheltering terrorists etc.) and to shun, oppose, hate and make jihad, including war, on non-Muslims.  Taqiyya (or Muda’rat), Kitman and Tawriya permit Muslims to lie for the cause of Islam either by outright lying (taqiyya, by telling half-truths (Kitman) or by making misleading (ambiguous) statements.  Taysir allows Muslims a “get out clause” from Sharia law and other religious practice if they can’t implement it fully; but if circumstances change to allow it, the practice(s) must be re-instated. Taysir is essentially passive in nature – not doing something Islam demands for reasons beyond Muslims’ control.  Darura is the active counterpart of Taysir and applies if Muslims are forced to do something “haram” it becomes “halal” with the proviso that it is of benefit to Islam and/or Muslims.  Maruna. Permits Muslims to carry out “haram” acts – if they are done for a greater Islamic good.  Hudna. Mistranslated or misconstrued in the West as meaning “peace”. In fact a strictly time-limited cessation of active hostilities, generally instituted when Muslims need to re-arm or re-group before re-commencing hostilities, thus, a period of “cold war”.  Hijra. It can be a flight from persecution (both to and from Islamic Countries), but it is also a migration for the purposes of jihad (which is more than just war/terror/violence) against a non-Muslim indigenous population.",8년 전,3,
