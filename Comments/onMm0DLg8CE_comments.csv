That's because it's fantasy, not sci-fi. Everything is completely out of the realm of possibility, and it embraces that fact and is better for it. Traditional sci-fi stands on the fact that in some far off future or past, the story could have taken place. And 2: Star Wars is hilarious. I've watched A New Hope I don't know how many times, but the first time I watched it as an adult, I was crying laughing at every other scene. The writing is so witty and natural and just tickles me. I rarely hear people bring those points up and it's awesom to hear Mark touch on them.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

And on top of his talents, there are plenty of folk tales regarding him just generally being a good bloke to those close to him, or even to complete strangers...

Hamill was supposed to do a scene where he jumped out and hit Stormare when he was on his knees (and the camera was behind Stormare).  Mark Hamill hit Peter Stormare so hard that his nose broke and bent to the side and one or ceveral teeth was punched out. Stormare asked the makeup woman to keap thr teeth on ice to save them and he blacked out.  Hamill never looked him in the eyes or said ”sorry” after that (supposedly because he might get sued by American standards if he does). He didn’t look Stormare in the eye in any of the premiers or said sorry. ”So Mark Hamill is a shithead and will always be a shithead. And is in my ’black book’ ” said Stormare in an interview.,2년 전,1,

@ccdogpark,I recommend everyone go back and read your comments  a day after you have posted them. I am noticing a lot of You tube comments being deleted. Sometimes I see as many as 4 of 5 replies to comments not viewable so they were obviously deleted.  But there is no notification when your comment is deleted.  It is just gone forever.  It seems like Youtube censers delete any comment  I write regardless of what it says or how general the statement it is or how innocuous it is. There is no rhyme or reason to it. And they do it in a way that you don't even notice unless you happen to go back and look for your comment again.   Don't just assume your comments are being left online  because they seemed to posted Ok. I'd love to know the purpose of this.

Often these older actors are tired of talking about some cult ScyFi they did decades ago, and they end up kind of insulting the project as not a serious piece of art. But Luke is still acknowledging what a great time it all was for the world.  Like most kids growing up in the late 70's and early 80's, Star Wars was a truly life changing experience. I didn't actually see the first one (not called A New Hope when it was released) in the theater. I was only 4, and unfortunately the adults responsible for my spiritual well being didn't know how important it was. But I did see Empire Strikes Back in the theater when I was 6, and I can still remember the awe to this very day. It may have been my first Blockbuster movie. Then Raiders, ET, Ghostbusters, etc..

@SelSun83,Peter Stomare made Hamilton 1998 with Mark Hamill. Hamill was supposed to do a scene where he jumped out and hit Stormare when he was on his knees (and the camera was behind Stormare).  Mark Hamill hit Peter Stormare so hard that his nose broke and bent to the side and one or ceveral teeth was punched out. Stormare asked the makeup woman to keap thr teeth on ice to save them and he blacked out.  Hamill never looked him in the eyes or said ”sorry” after that (supposedly because he might get sued by American standards if he does). He didn’t look Stormare in the eye in any of the premiers or said sorry. ”So Mark Hamill is a shithead and will always be a shithead. And is in my ’black book’ ” said Stormare in an interview.,2년 전,0,

There's a scene at the very end where the script called for a lot of dialogue meant to explain the main characters' feelings --- ""exposition"", as they call it in 'Hollywood'. HF thought that the dialogue was unnecessary and convinced the director, Peter Weir, to simply go with exchanged looks and body language (which puts all the weight on the actors). The scene was more emotional than any dialogue could have delivered and has become iconic as far as film endings.

Armageddon is about 4 action events.     1st horse, Bow = Send it.    2nd horse, Sword = Strike it.    3rd horse, Scales = Split it.    4th horse, Fire = Sear it.     And that ='s Our planet for the past 2 years have averaged 3.23 Rockets a day into space.    That's hundreds of rockets we've ""Send""/sent up.    They are weapons designed to stop ""Wormwood"" in Revelations.    All Telescopes on this planet are pointing in the same direction.    Elon is building underground tunnels in major cities.  2. ""The mark of the beast"".       Take 3 6's and place them in a circle and you have a virus warning symbol.     But the Mark is the VACCINE. And because it is a global problem it will demand a global solution.     The Vaccine will be given Airborne and it will land on your forehead and hands.     It comes from Chromosome 7 lamb1.     This is the moment where the Bible mentions: You will wish the mountains to fall on you.     And this is the moment where the Bible mentions: The ""few"" and the ""many"".     ""Few"" will die from this Vaccine (millions) and ""many"" will live (billions).     This vaccine will cure all diseases BUT it will not remove the Pain from any injuries you receive.     This is the moment of the ""delusion"" mentioned in Revelations.      If you get a cut or any injury, the pain will never go away, they just keep building up.     You will wish the ""mountains to fall on you"".     666 (six - sick - sicknesses) <->  Six species of human corona viruses are known ,      with one species subdivided into two different strains,          making seven strains of human corona viruses altogether.     And you who think the part about the ""buying and selling unless you have the mark"" is a chip ..that's not right.     You have to understand the person who wrote revelations was seeing specific moments of the future.     When He saw those buying and selling who had the ""mark"", he was looking at those who were living during the      4 Action Events of Armageddon (see my other video please) and the 7 year reign of the antichrist. Those who are      ""born again"" have done been raptured away with Jesus. The body of Christ doesn't go thru those events. Only ones alive     are the ones who have LIVED who got the mark. You see, though everyone gets it..not everyone dies from it. Those who did     die are the ones who are ""raptured to Jesus"". The ""mark"" only kill the ""born again"" people of Jesus (see video and comments for      further understanding).    3. The scorpions mentioned in Revelations 9:10.      There are satellites in space called HIVES.    Inside each of them are tiny rockets called BEES.    They are designed to Target all CELL PHONES.    They will be mercy killings by our governments because of the actions above (for 5 Months).  Please I'm begging you to listen to what I've said. These events are happening right now. I don't post links no more because YouTube removes them. This is so important that you help  me tell others. I didn't make anything up. If you get a moment come see what else I've discovered on my channel. But I beg you with all of my heart and soul to at least tell someone what you've read. Please at least do that.",4년 전,0,

@Puschit1,"Can't say Luke was my favourite Star Wars character but I am rarely into the hero characters - they are usually boring and generic. Luke Skywalker, however, was young, clueless, impulsive and generally very relateable. I also think the movies did a good job balancing screentime and storylines between the main characters. Han Solo isn't just a sidekick - he is indipendent and cooler than his hero buddy. Leia isn't just a love interest and damsel in distress - she is a strong woman, leader of the rebels and capable of handling things herself. C3PO and R2D2 aren't just comedic relief characters - without their computer and other skills the team would be dead many times (and R2D2 was kind of the McGuffin of episode 4). Lando Calrissian isn't just the token black character - he has a remarkable character development since his betrayal of the imperials.  What I am saying is, the original trilogy isn't one where a larger-than-life macho type of hero overshadows everyone else and therefore, for once, Luke Skywalker was a character I could accept as the hero.

@osrikking8785," @Arcademan09  I saw it in theaters when it came out.  I know ALL about the Star Wars craze as I was a kid at the time and my life revolved around star wars for a good 7 years!  What I'm saying is that the effects and story made it hugely appealing, but what made it span generations and stand up to time and have lasting power wasn't the two dimensional Luke character that has his story book character arc very similar to a young King Arthur, what made them truly good films were the characters and actors I mentioned.  Han the conflicted anti hero turned hero and Vader, the mysterious and horrifying villain.  I liked a lot of films I saw when I was a kid in the 70s or a teen in the 80s - but most wear off with time and you watch them as an adult and realize ""yeah, it's not how I remember it"".

Keep in mind that characters like Han are also very typical... the comic relief (with romance); most tend to favor those type of characters overall, regardless. Plus it's Harrison Ford... watching many reactions with the newer fans see him & automatically favor his character in an instant because he's a familiar actor. But none of this means Luke is actually boring. The only thing i wished that we saw more of, with Luke in the original trilogy, is him in his prime, actually kicking complete ass, like we see in the Mandolorian... there's a reason why that scene achieved having grown up men crying, when they saw LUKE in his prime, finally.",3년 전(수정됨),1,

@jakestewart5899,"I know this doesn't have anything to do with the video, but I would like to share these questions and this message with as many people as possible.   1. What do you think happens to someone after they die? 2. Do you think there is an afterlife?  3. If heaven exists, how do you get there?  4. Would you be good enough to get into heaven?   Here are a few questions to see if you are a good person:    1. How many lies have you told in your whole life?  2. Have you ever stolen?  3. Have you ever used God's name in vain? 4. Jesus said that ""whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart"" (Matthew 5:28). Have you ever looked with lust?  5. If you have broken any of these commandments, would you be innocent or guilty on Judgment Day?  6. Would you go to Heaven or Hell?   The Bible says that ""all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone"" (Revelation 21:8) and ""Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people — none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God"" (1 Corinthians 6:9-10). So, if you are guilty of any of the ten commandments, then you are in trouble when Judgment Day comes! Do you know what God did for guilty sinners so that we wouldn't have to go to Hell?    2,000 years ago, God became a human being, Jesus of Nazareth, who suffered and died on the cross for our sins and rose from the dead on the third day, defeating death. The punishment that we deserve for breaking God's law, Jesus took in our place. He paid the fine that we could never pay so that God can legally set us free by forgiving our sins. He is just, by punishing evil through Jesus’ death on the cross, while being rich in mercy towards us.    What you have to do is repent, or confess and forsake your sins, and trust alone in Jesus Christ. Don't trust your own goodness, because, as Jesus said, “No one is good — except God alone” (Mark 10:18). Trust alone in the savior. The moment you do that, God will forgive every sin you have ever committed and grant you eternal life, and He will give you a new heart with new desires, so that you will love to do what is right. You will be born again. But you must repent and trust in Jesus.    When are you going to do that?

I have some minor problems about how Isabelle de France was depicted, some historical hiccups (the whole Margaret conundrum didn't happen until 1314 iirc, and was an actual affair between two of the king's sons wives and the two lads who were used by Isabelle in the series), as well as some plot lines that were never continued in season 2 (which is a shame), but the story is pretty great and has a very big Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings in medieval France kind of vibe. The costumes were excellent in season 1, and felt less... Medieval in season 2 especially for the king and De Nogaret, who felt more like heroic fantasy characters, which is was a bit disappointing. But the acting was always great, the settings splendid, and the overall series immensely enjoyable.  I don't know if the books ""Les Rois Maudits"" (lit. The Cursed Kings) were ever translated in English, but these are basically historical books that happen right after the Templars trial and Jacques de Molay's death, in 1314. Written with a lot of historical researches, to be as close as possible to what happened in France at the time. It's madly entertaining. 👌🏻",4년 전,0,

@michaal105,"Would you consider yourself to be a good person?  How many lies have you told, and what do you call someone who lies? Have you ever stolen something, no matter how small, and what do you call someone who steals? Have you ever taken God's name in vain/blasphemed, even ‘OMG’? That’s taking the name of the God who gave you life and using it in the place of a cuss word – would you do that with your mother’s name? Have you ever dishonoured your parents? Jesus said whoever looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery in his heart. Have you ever looked with lust? Most people probably have broken all 5 of these commandments. I myself have. I’m not judging you but if you have done these things then you’re a lying, thieving, blasphemous, rebellious adulterer-at-heart by your own admission. That's only 5 of the 10 commandments. God is fully just so he must and will punish every and all sin (which is departure from/rebellion towards God and the conscience) when he judges us. He cannot simply cancel our debt and let us go, or else he would be unjust. If you went into the courtroom and said: ‘Yes Judge, I’ve done these things but I also give money to the Red Cross and volunteer at an old-age home. I try my best to love people’ the judge is not going to take that into consideration. You’ve broken the law; the good you’ve done won’t help at all on the day of judgement.  If he judges you by the moral law will you be innocent or guilty? Heaven or Hell? The answer is Hell. Doesn’t that concern you? But, fortunately, that is not God’s will. He is so loving and merciful, he made a way for you to be forgiven. The Son of God came down as a man, Jesus Christ, and lived a perfect, sinless life, so was the perfect sacrifice. He excruciatingly suffered and died on the cross to pay the FULL debt we owe because of sin; justice is fully done. You and I broke God's law and Jesus paid the fine in his life's blood, being resurrected again 3 days later. That’s why he said “It is finished” on the cross – in other words the debt has been paid. God has the payment ready to go for you. What you need to do is repent (recognising you are a sinner deserving God's punishment, turn to Him) and trust ALONE in Jesus for the forgiveness of your sins. Our works can do nothing as by the standard of God’s moral law we fail, but faith in him is enough to save us from all sin – past, present and future! Then though you have grievously offended God, he will forgive you and you will inherit eternal life being reborn in the Holy Spirit when you put your trust in the Lord and saviour. Too, you enter a covenant relationship with God – sonship, and truly I tell you your life will change in his presence. So repent and trust (i.e. Biblical faith), receive the free gift of grace.  He redeemed me. God, The King of The Universe, came down as a man. He lived the first 30 years of his life as a poor carpenter then spent the next 3 preaching, healing and saving souls - all the while being persecuted, insulted and hated by his own people - and took the punishment to save our lives. It’s the most amazing love that anyone ever displayed. Christianity’s not just a religion. It's a pure, sweet relationship with God. Because of Jesus, I am now a son of God. He is my dad, and you can be his child too. God loves you. Will you let him come?. . .. . .. . .",5년 전,1,
@boystainey, @michaal105  good afternoon mike. Please stop abusing barbiturates.,5년 전,1,
@michaal105," @boystainey  I'm of sound mind my friend. You don't know this, but I was an agnostic for most of my life. When I was 17, I started searching for the truth regarding God and whether or not he existed. I researched Atheism, Christianity, and Islam as well as learning of a few others for a few months. By the end the conclusion was clear: Jesus Christ is the only truth. I only ask that as you read the remainder of this comment, please have an open mind and allow me to share with you a piece of evidence - it's quote compelling.   In my view the strongest piece of evidence is Jesus' resurrection.   Jesus' existence is a historically established fact (if you are familiar with basic history, I'm sure you'll concede this point) Even non-Christian scholars agree on this. We actually have 12 distinct extra-biblical sources from the time period of Christianity's earliest days to confirm this, both Roman and Jewish (one of which I’ll quote at the end of this reply). They were against Christianity, yet their sources give credence to the existence of its central figure. As such, the Christ-Myth theory is complete rubbish and no serious historical scholar takes it seriously. The historical consensus is that Jesus did indeed exist.  The proof of The Christian God hinges mainly on the resurrection. In order to prove this we need to establish a) Jesus was indeed dead and b) he was alive again later. One of the gospel writers was also one of Jesus' 12 apostles, John. He was present at the crucifixion. He describes the stabbing of Jesus lung as a sudden outflow of blood and then water - this is exactly how an uneducated laymen would describe the rupturing of the pericardial sac, giving credence that his death was authentic. The Romans too were very thorough in their executions, which is why they stabbed Jesus to make sure he was dead. Jesus could not have faked it. Non-Christian scholars agree that he indeed died on the cross. To quote a JEWISH scholar - Pinchas Lapide: ''Jesus' death by crucifixion is historically certain.'' The MUSLIM Scholar Reza Aslan said: “Islam doesn’t believe that Jesus was crucified. Jesus was most definitely crucified.” The ATHEIST scholar Gerd Ludemann: “Jesus’ death as a consequence of crucifixion is indisputable.” Another JEW, Paula Fredriksen says: “The single most solid fact about Jesus’ life is his death”. Even Bart Ehrman, arguably the most well-known ATHEIST critic of the scriptures says: “One of the most CERTAIN FACTS OF HISTORY is that Jesus was crucified on orders of the Roman prefect of Judea, Pontius Pilate.”  Historians agree that the tomb was indeed empty, for various reasons. The belief in Christ's resurrection is dated soon after his death. To quote James DG Dunn, speaking on the resurrection: ""This tradition we can be entirely confident was formulated within months of Jesus' death."" If the tomb wasn't empty then the Jews and Romans, noticing the fast spread of early Christianity, would have either removed the body and hung it at the city gates (in the case of the Romans) or encouraged the early Christians and the Jews around them to take a look at the body in the tomb. But this didn't happen, because the tomb did not have Jesus in it.  Secondly, Jesus' tomb was first discovered empty by women. Women were viewed very lowly in first-century Palestine (First-century Jewish scholar Josephus wrote that the testimony of a woman could not be trusted, the predominant attitude among the Palestinian men at the time under the false guise that they were naturally mentally inferior). Yet the gospels, and in particular the gospel of Luke (whom archaeologist Sir William Ramsay said: ""should be placed along with the very greatest of historians'') attributes a woman as the first witnesses. If Christ's resurrection were false and the early Christians wanted the people of their day to believe he was risen, they would have attributed the initial witness of Christ's resurrection to a man. The reason they didn't is because they wanted to record as accurately as possible the events that occurred - the true resurrection of Jesus.  Historically, the Jews circulated the story that Jesus' disciples had stolen the body. This was not only addressed in the gospel of Matthew, but in the second century Justin Martyr recorded that it was still being circulated in his day! There would be no need had the tomb not been empty.  But the disciples could not possibly have stolen the body. Pontius Pilate sent out a detachment of Roman soldiers who took shifts day and night guarding the tomb, so as to prevent anyone from stealing the body. A Roman guard was a group consisting of 10 to 30 soldiers. They took shifts day and night, so there was never a time in the days before Jesus' resurrection that the tomb was never being watched - they would have seen the disciples approach. Even if they were asleep the stone, weighing about 3 or 4 thousand pounds would  have needed to be pushed by multiple of Jesus' followers to have a chance of being moved; so they would have been seen, heard struggling and the heavy stone heard moving, arrested and killed. This did not happen. This leaves us with the fact that the disappearance of Jesus' body from the tomb could not have happened from an outside source coming in. It had to have happened on the inside, where only the dead Jesus lay. Hence, we can conclude he was resurrected.  Giving further credence to this is that 10 of the 11 remaining (after Judas' betrayal) disciples were executed because of their Christian faith, as attested confidently by historical sources. To quote Sean McDowell of Peter: ''The early, consistent and unanimous testimony is that Peter died as a martyr;"" and of the martyrdom of the disciples as a whole: ""It shows the depth of the apostles’ convictions. They were not liars. They truly believed Jesus rose from the grave and they were willing to give their lives for it."" They needed only to deny their faith to be saved, but did not. Would you seriously die for something that you know wasn't true? These men died fully believing in their contact with the risen Christ. For more on thr martyrdom of Peter, you can research 1st century sources such as 1st Clement - amomgst others.   Some have theorised that they merely had hallucinations, but this isn't true for 4 reasons: 1) The theory of hallucinations does not explain the empty tomb. It can't be ignored.  2) Multiple people shared in group-visions of Jesus 3) They had group-conversations with the risen Christ 4) They touched Jesus and ate with him, which is impossible with a hallucination. The gospel of John speaks of Thomas physically touching Jesus' wounds to prove to himself he was real!  Another evidence was Paul's conversion. Luke (as said, a first-rate historian) records in the Book of Acts that Paul persecuted the early church before being converted after seeing and talking with the risen Jesus on the road to Damascus. This was also confirmed by Paul in his own letters, in which he also expresses his deep remorse at persecuting God's church, saying he doesn't even consider himself worthy as an apostle after the way he persecuted early Christians (see 1 Corinthians 15:9). He hated them, then he became arguably their most influential apostle. Historians report that he too was martyred for his faith. This would not have happened had he not encountered the risen Jesus.  In one of Paul's letters to the church in the early days of Christianity, First Corinthians (Chapter 15 for reference), he speaks of Christ's post-resurrection appearances to people (over 500 in total), even encouraging the Corinthian church, if they don't take his word for it, to speak to the people who saw the risen Jesus if they don't believe - that they may have mental assurance of his resurrection. If the resurrection was something he and the other apostles made up he would not encourage believers to speak to people who could discredit the apostle's claims.  And consider this, that the someone did not just sit down and write the bible. 4 independently written narrative sources (the gospels) and even more letters from different authors such as Paul and Peter, are consistent on this fact of Jesus' resurrection - with secular sources testifying of the earliest Christians' convictions of the resurrection as a fact - to the point they died for their beliefs.  If we take all of these together it becomes clear that Jesus rose from the dead, which would be impossible unless it was a miracle of God. Please consider this, and may The Lord show you the way my friend. Amen.  SOURCE: Reporting on Emperor Nero's decision to blame the Christians for the fire that had destroyed Rome in A.D. 64, the Roman historian Tacitus wrote:  “Nero fastened the guilt ... on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of ... Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome”  What can we learn from this ancient reference to Jesus and the early Christians? Notice, first, that Tacitus reports Christians derived their name from a historical person called Christus (from the Latin), or Christ. He is said to have ""suffered the extreme penalty,"" obviously alluding to the Roman method of execution known as crucifixion. This is said to have occurred during the reign of Tiberius and by the sentence of Pontius Pilatus. This confirms much of what the Gospels tell us about the death of Jesus.. . .. . .",5년 전,1,

@JohnSmith-bk8yb,"Hello! Hi! First off, thank you, everybody, so much. We've raised $106,272 for charity through the merchandise sales on the Pixel Empire! That's insane!! Like insane insane!! Of course, ""The Mysterious Game of Crypticism"" sold out within two and a half hours, which is also insane insane. I never expect stuff like that to do too well, so thank you for your interest! It's like: oh wow, well that was a tolerable idea apparently! Now, it was tricky to do just another run of copies for sale as there's a certificate of authenticity included within each of the 1000 copies denoting just how many copies exist. So, we decided to do another run of copies in the most irritating way possible! On November 27th at 5 PM EST, a ""Second Edition"" variant of ""The Mysterious Game of Crypticism"" will be available, it's the exact same product but with a tart yellow label, blue curtain background instead of a red one and a different certificate of authenticity. Same price of $64.99, same amount goes to charity: all of it! You spend $64.99 on the product, $64.99 goes to charity. Discount codes and free shipping don't apply to this product to ensure the most money possible goes to the charities, I hope you understand. There will be 500 copies available and they'll ship by January 2021, after that, this product's gone-so! The final copies of ""The Internet and You"" on VHS will be available on November 27th at 5 PM EST as well, on top of a few new poster and shirt designs!  Thank you for allowing me to do junk like this. And who knows, maybe we can raise $106,273 for charity! Anything's possible! We're closing in on the end of the year, so I've gotta scram and work on some garbage.

I hoped he would, one day, be a live action movie as The Joker, but too many people would want him to be like  the cartoon one in the more nuanced live action origin movie and Dark Knight (though he could have done it well), he was too old for the version in Suicide Squad and he did reprise the role in the One Bad Day animated version of him becoming The Joker.",5년 전,0,

There are a lot of people I have enjoyed and would enjoy meeting/talking/hanging out with and they haven't all been famous nor should that be a requirement nor was I obsessed with them or considered them gods or god-like! They intriqued me, is that allowed?!?  Some people can be very interesting and are ones you can learn from just like they may possibly learn something from me in a two-way discourse.. This is good. People are all, to some degree, in need of interaction with others that get them excited while are interesting, knowledgeable, and have been to places and done things that we have dreamed in journeying to, participating in, and/or witnessing - this is only  normal, natural, and somewhat instinctual!! It's hard enough to keep your dreams alive today while fighting a routine that has many of us ""tied down"" in responsibilities, and if someone like Mark Hamill makes you happy in how he symbolizes adventure while remaining a good  example of someone who could very well be willing to help show you the way/ further inspire you/escape with you (if only with a five minute chat sometime) then that's very well and all fantastically positive! Why wouldn't he be nothing less than honored to do so with a fan and fellow adventurer...and this may just be the case!! Mark Hamill is still around having fun and loving Star Wars in large part due to his loving fan base and he KNOWS this fact well!!! Society puts a lot of borders around people, people  usually don't  themselves!!! So I say haters should relax -  it's not always about obsession; while those adventurous in spirit continue to dream and stay young at heart!!! The dreamers' time will come one day!!!! Dare to dream, live life out with all the gifts and beauty it has to offer!!! If you're an angry person what I have said will be construed as ""happy horse do-do"" while those calm and at peace thru the Force will get a charge from my little piece here, a few volts of renewed inspiration knowing I am making sense, and moreover, knowing I know that you're worthy of following your passions and dreams whoever you are!!!!!!

He was a nice guy and talked to everyone.Seth is really short also.  Mark Hamill came into the room and got up on stage and talked to everyone with a mic.

Humour is a plot tool to break tension (eg. such as the imminent danger/death, first greeting, or some other action that is going to have an effect upon a character) and romance adds humanity, sensory engagement/involvement and feeling. Sir Alec Guinness was actually in a lot of light-hearted comedies (Kind Hearts and Coronets) romantic leads (The Malta Story) as well as more punchy and serious war dramas (Bridge on The River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago etc.). Star Wars was originally designed to meander along a winding path (or perhaps walk atop a narrow wall or fence) amongst all and including all, of these different elements/genres.

After so much training we were inured to the idea of being on the moon. We also knew very well what to expect. And when we got there, nearly every move was choreographed. We were on a clock, with a constant stream of tasks which had to be performed. It was a mentally and physically demanding job, and there were any number of ways we could have died. You, watching on television here on Earth, or seeing a documentary, nicely edited, narrated and with good music, were able to experience a joy, amazement, awe, and wonder that we were pretty much denied.

@kennydargenson,"Your comment is naive. He's acting. His ""job"" ever since these movies ended, due to type casting and actually not being very good and therefore not ever being able to work in movies again, has been to pretend humility and enthusiasm when talking about them, leeching off the fan base.  It's always amazing to me how ready people are to forget that actors act. Seth suggests that the photo proves the cast was having lots of fun making the movie. Sheer nonsense. That is a staged photo in which the actors were told to pretend to be having fun to market the picture, a tradition that dates back to the earliest days of Hollywood.  High on his own juice, Luke actually starts contending that Star Wars was meant as a comedy. I'm sure some people see it that way, but huge numbers take it just as seriously as 2001. Making movies isn't a lark, it's endless repetition with no real chance for actual sustained acting.  But so many are ready to buy into the illusion.",2년 전,0,

The deadline and intangible date for the start of the Tribulations is the evening of November 12, 2023 --> HORROR ON EARTH.

Because having refused HIS BLOOD TO THE CROSS until this Rapture of the Church, you will then have to suffer and die for JESUS CHRIST in order to obtain eternal life, at your death, because yes.... after your death earthly for CHRIST, you will go to Heaven, because you will have carried your cross.

@DreamerFromTheDepths," @ArchOwl  That's a relatively fair response to make, I guess I should take this one step at a time, it can be argued that Boomer is a mindset and not a generation, I called it a mindset of a Boomer so people would understand I was referring to the meme. Which of course betrays boomers as ""young people these days, they can't do anything for themselves, they get everything handed to them on a plate.""  And while I don't think that any younger people or people around my age do have life that easy, I think they actually have life much harder than boomers ever did, you have to stay in education for 24 or so years just to get a degree and getting jobs is tougher too for many reasons that weren't a factor in the Boomer generation.  But I think the way I do about things in real life, memes have a fine place on the Internet on Behind the Memea and of course in their original locations and pictures.  But I've met some people in real life who seem to hide behind memes in a way, exchanging their own thoughts which would be interesting to hear and probably don't line up with the meme they're using, it just seems like a good way to quickly escape a conversation because there's no way to respond to the one-liner memes.  It just comes off as lazy sometimes or passive aggressive if they instantly use a meme to back out of a conversation, tell me how someone would respond to a random outburst of (I can't think of a one liner meme at the moment actually, but there are plenty.)  How else am I supposed to respond other than humour them with a laugh or respond with ""yeah?""  I don't know it can sometimes be kind of annoying, I'd rather just be told to stop talking or have them make up an excuse rather than randomly use a meme and then walk away.  Well on the other hand if you want to instantly end conversations and avoid making friends I guess it's something you could choose to do, always works, it just completely silences the person who was talking because they're left too confused to continue talking.  I don't know, it happens quite a lot, there's a whole Web comic that pokes fun at it, and it should be true to the Internet but it shouldn't be accurate to what's actually going on in reality.  Maybe it's just me but I like to hold conversations if the topic is interesting, but who knows? Maybe I'm just butthurt because it seems to happen all the time to me ironically in real life I've never been hit with the ""ok Boomer"" meme.  Only a matter of time I'm sure, either way things seem to have calmed down briefly but I think it's just because it's the start of the new year, I'm sure the new memes will be every conversation again until next year when they come out.  So yeah, I' not sure if mentioned it originally but it's more or less a piece of my personal life more than my overarching thoughts.  Memes on the Internet have a place, using memes to make a YouTube channel rather than do something yourself is something that clickbaiters get condemned for but not these guys, and in real life the use of them is very awkward outside of the meme actually being the topic.",5년 전,0,

But over the years he has had no choice but to accommodate himself to a single casting choice. And almost without fail he's done so incredibly gracefully. I can't stand the whole franchise now - it's a stupid quasi-mystical pastiche. But he's come out of the one movie I idolised as a seven year old in 1977 remarkably well.,6년 전,0,

The Electoral College For Dummies  All Of Your Votes Always Count. Your Electoral Collegiate needs to count Your vote in Your county and report the winner of the election (in Your county) to Washington DC. No One Over Rides Your Vote But You When You Don't Vote.

Get to know it the way an adult should. Be the Kings and Queens our documents make all of You. 2) RESEARCH the Politicians and Judges You want to represent You and show up on election day and vote. You Pick Your Judges,,, Kings and Queens.  WHAT did you do...  70% of the voting age population FAILED in 2016. 45% didn't give a darn and didn't even vote, but still complain. 25% voted for a well known treasonous criminal named Hillary Clinton to be President.  At the time of the 2016 Election, YouTube alone had over 352,600 videos describing the crimes of the Clinton Crime Family. Books had been written. Documentaries and Movies had been produced, many aired on national TV. And still allegedly 65 million people voted for a well known treasonous gangster named Hillary Clinton to be the President.  Perhaps ALL of their names should be added to the No Buy No Fly No Drive lists before they become terrorists.  Donald Trump, a well known patriotic Democrat was elected by Patriots to be a Republican President. To help dismantle both corrupt treasonous Republican and Democrat parties. And restore Patriotic Christian Values back to our 3 branches of government. Many of You failed to help in 2016 and 2018.

@ph0ngLP,"Intention tremor.  Guy hasn't had a drink in a couple hours.  Hamill is awesome, but he is obviously a heavy drinker.  'The Shakes' as they are known.  He has to drink to function normally, otherwise he will get confused and get tremors.   Alcoholics drink to function normally.  Otherwise, they get tremors and cloudy and weak.  They can dry out over the course of 3 or 4 days, but it's really rough and you basically can't take care of yourself.  His hands were shaking bad, and I bet he hadn't had a drink in 6 hours.   If you actually dry out, the shakes get way worse, hot/cold sweat, fever, nausea, diarrhea, you literally cannot keep water in your body and feel like you are dying for several days.  Pissing non-stop too.  It's hard to dry out, it takes several days and your body will reject and evacuate all water.  So you are just super dehydrated and have tremors from over excited GABA receptors that have no fuel.   That's why it's hard for alcoholics to stop drinking, because it's the fuel that allows them to function.

@ph0ngLP," @josephmcdonagh8389  Well, it's a question of lifestyle I suppose.  This is classic intention tremor and mannerisms to counteract and hide the tremors.  He is wildly extravagant with his hands, because he doesn't want people to see them shaking, so he can't allow them to be still.  If he keeps making broad swinging motions, the tremor won't kick in.  I guaruntee he can't pick a glass off the table for a drink.  He'd spill it all over himself.  There were no breaks, and he never took a sip of water.  That's pretty uncommon in these late night interview shows, as it allows a comedic break for a joke and a rest for the guest, and some time for the host.  Intention Tremor.",6년 전,0,

The 'healthcare' system is attacking private citizens with Allopathy being the only option, cancer-causing drugs, cutting organs out, and radiation.  The same people that pushed United States to only serve vaccines and petrochemical pharmaceuticals, are the same people that found out that homeopathic has an over 90% success rate.   I have news for you.  It's factual conspiracy when CDC/FDA allow cancer-causing vaccines and petrochemical drugs to be pushed, due to their relationship to the vaccine/drug manufacturers.

The Malaria parasite lives inside red cells, and in people with sickle cell, when their red cells experience low oxygen, the cells collapse into the sickle shape. The parasite by its very nature causes low oxygen, and the sickling kills it. However, because people with full sickle cell disease (as opposed to just the trait) suffer greatly, it's not considered so much of an adaptation, more like a mutation with both deleterious and beneficial effects.",6년 전,1,

@TheShamansQuestion," @koatam  by boring you mean no exciting action? Because something can be entertaining without action and ppl typically use the word ""boring"" only when it's not entertaining. (""boring"" reserved for movies that lack interest beyond just action)   If, on the other hand, you prefer your movies to have action, then okay, that's fine; maybe 2001 isn't actually your kind of movie.  We're fussing over details here and maybe I'm wrong, just seems like ""boring"" has extra meaning",6년 전,1,

@koatam," @TheShamansQuestion  Yes, I'm just being hyperbolic. 2001 is a great movie, but it's not a movie I widely recommend. It requires a special mindset that most don't poses. Most people will find it boring. Boring can describe something that lacks excitement, but It really is a joke for the most part making fun of this mindset. here is a pretty great example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFNtf95roQk",6년 전,5,

The second film should have been the torch passing, and the third focusing on the new blood.

All I wanted out of this new trilogy was just one scene with all three of them together again, but they went and fucked that up when they killed off Han in the first movie. Now Carrie is dead, Ford won't go near the character of Han anymore, and I don't think Mark Hamill was pleased with the direction Luke took in TLJ so he's probably lost interest as well.

His opinions on Luke’s arc in TLJ actually greatly benefit his performance as it suited the characters’ general state of mind through the beginning and middle of the film.   His performance added great depth to a character many thought had stagnated over the past 30+ years. In my opinion, TLJ is his acting masterpiece.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

While in live action he is best recognised for Star Wars, his voice acting work is extensive, varied, and highly regarded.

For example, many consider his version of the Joker to be one of the greatest of all time.  The man is an absolute legend. It is honestly difficult to name a major cartoon he hasn’t worked on in some capacity, even if you only count minor or one-off roles in shows like Hey Arnold, Powerpuff Girls, Ren & Stimpy, Danny Phantom, Spongebob Squarepants, The Boondocks, Gravity Falls (and SO MUCH more).  Let alone iconic roles like the Joker, Fire Lord Ozai (Avatar the Last Airbender), multiple characters including Skips from The Regular Show,     just a mindboggling array of comic super heroes and villains, plus the english voice for anime such as Nausicca Valley of the Wind and Castle in the Sky....

But in the actual Gotham city comics frame, Hammill's kicked that to the curb.  Its iconic for a generation and decade.  Wing commander was an amazing role for the time as well, and while similar typecast, put him in a much more serious role in the space opera genre he helped begin 15 or so years prior.

To be fair to Harrison Ford (since you were mentioning success in their respective chosen career paths), for quite a while during the 80s and 90s he was perhaps THE top actor in Hollywood, with Indiana Jones alone being a world-wide blockbuster.",6년 전,0,
@chinuaalibatya7345,He voiced Fire Lord Ozai and The Joker on several occasions,6년 전,0,
@nemdenemam9753, @nicknamenescio  thats true I forgot how many big movies he had back then. I just considered him not as big because he mostly played the same character in every movie so he didnt really reach the top of the acting chain imo. While Mark Hamill is an absolute legend in voice acting. But maybe its not fair to think of them like that since voice acting is probably less saturated.,6년 전,0,
@nicknamenescio," @nemdenemam9753  Yes, you are right that he played similar characters in quite a few movies, although I think Deckard from Blade Runner does not share that many characteristics with Indy. But he had his way of playing things, totally agree. Not as uniform as De Niro (great actor in his own right, ofc), but also not as varied as others. And I definitely think that being at the top in voiceacting is not the slightest bit inferior to being a top actor, as long as top means successful: I feel that to be successful in voiceacting you simply need to be really good, pitch, emotion, expression. You cannot hide a lack of skills behind looks. Also, in acting you can get famous with less demanding genres (action), although voiceacting for less demanding genres sure is also less demanding (d'oh), but you will not get famous. You need to nail the complex and memorable roles.",6년 전(수정됨),2,

@nemdenemam9753," @mannyrobles3065  your reading comprehension really sucks. "" level of success in their respective chosen path after star wars (other than already established actors)"". Although I did specify the prequels which was wrong but the statement still stands. I was alluding to the fact that actors who break out in such a big role a lot of times cant transition out of it. Also ""in their respective fields"". Harrison Ford did make it but I dont think he is considered such a legend in acting circles as Hamill is in voice acting. Although I didnt realize he had as many critically acclaimed roles as he did so maybe screw that. But do you really consider Harrison Ford as one of the great actors? Does he have the range of Alec Guinnes? He is an amazing action star and I love his movies but he usually acts the same in them. While Hamill is the voice of many different iconic characters. However if we look at monetary success then its hard to argue Ford is not top of the top",6년 전,0,

@rocketreindeer,"There's a lot more to him than meets the eye.  I remember watching him on MAD TV in a sketch years ago and he was frickin' hilarious.  He could totally be part of an ensemble or have his own comedy show like that and it would be totally natural.  He wrote his own sci-fi comic I think in the early 2000s.  And has acted on Broadway to good reviews.  It's also interesting and funny when he kind of slams the modern Star Wars movies.  And the thing I like about him the best is he's naturally funny and does all this stuff, but doesn't go around telling people how great he is, and seems to truly be a real person with no need for a giant ego. It's hard not to like a guy like that.",6년 전,4,

I loved it. I think it's one of Bad Lip Reading's best videos. The Yoda Seagulls song and the Hostiles On The Hill song are really good, too.

@brit2667,"Steven Bowser They definitely start him off that way, but I think it’s done purposely. The fact that in the beginning Luke doesn’t know how special and important he is. He’s just a whiny, bratty teenager who gets pretty much thrown into this huge adventure, and he learns a lot about respect and himself along the way. A New Hope Luke vs Return of the Jedi Luke is a huge, amazing jump. As he learned about the force he learned about himself as well. Like how Yoda said he had no patience and Luke kept whining and freaking out for the entirety of his first onscreen training, and then it all pays off as we see the well-mannered, mature, respectable Jedi in the time jump to ROTJ. The fact that Luke had no charm WAS his charm, he was just a normal teenage boy (relatable to the target audience) who developed into a powerful man throughout the movies.",6년 전,0,
