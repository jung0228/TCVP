@Kandosii," @sunstirade1085  I'm almost certain the stuff I saw was a species of bacteria very similar to what's shown in this video. These bacteria essentially eat iron and produce rust, contributing to the brown or orange color of the slime they produce. They tend to live in transition zones where water goes from having very little oxygen in it to having a lot of oxygen. In my case, that was a muddy place near a stream.

@dogslobbergardens6606,"re: longer rotor blades and bigger spindle (which would make the rotor turn faster): It's interesting to ponder exactly how big to build this blower before it just becomes more of a hassle than it's worth. At some ridiculous point it's going to get so big you'd be running back and forth between the blower and the actual forge to keep it going. More importantly, you want a good volume of air getting into the forge, but not really at high speed. Blowing air into it REAL FAST doesn't help the forge get any hotter, it just sends sparks and ash flying everywhere and eats up fuel faster.  Honestly, I think what he's already got there is just about perfect for a small, one-person operation.",4년 전,1,

@baderalbader3478,"http://www.saaid.net/islam/1.htm  https://youtu.be/j0e_HDnfN7k  WHAT IS ISLAM? Can we find an explanation of the great universe? Is there any convincing interpretation of the secret of existence? We realize that no family can function properly without a responsible head, that no city can prosperously exist without sound administration, and that no state can survive without a leader of some kind. We also realize that nothing comes into being on its own. Moreover, we observe that the universe exists and functions in the most orderly manner, and that it has survived for hundreds of thousand of years. Can we then say that all this is accidental and haphazard? Can we attribute the existence of man and the whole world to mere chance. Man represents only a very small portion of the great universe. And if he can make plans and appreciate the merits of planning, then his own existence and the survival of the universe must also be a planned policy. This means that there is an extraordinary power to bring things into being and keep them moving in order. In the world then must be a great force in action to keep everything in order. In the beautiful nature there must be a Great creator who creates the most charming pieces of art produces every thing for a special purpose in life. The deeply enlightened people recognize this creator and call him Allah ""God"". He is not a man because no man can create or make another man. He is not an animal, nor he is a plant. He is neither an Idol nor is He a statue of any kind because non of these things can make itself or create anything else. He is different from all these things because he is the maker and keeper of them all. The maker of anything must be different from and greater than things which he makes. There are various ways to know God ""ALLAH'' and there are many things to tell about him. The great wonders and impressive marvels of the world are like open books in which we can read about God. Besides, God Himself comes to our aid through the many Messengers and revelations He has sent down to man. These Messengers and revelations tell us everything we need to know about God. The complete acceptance of the teachings and guidance of God 'Allah' as revealed to His Messengers Muhammad is the religion of Islam. Islam enjoins faith in the oneness and sovereignty of Allah, which makes man aware of meaningfulness of the Universe and of his place in it. This belief frees him from all fears and superstitions by making him conscious of the presence of the Almighty Allah and of man's obligations towards Him. This faith must be expressed and tested in actions, faith alone is not enough. Belief in one God requires that we look upon all humanity as one family under the universal Omnipotence of God the Creator and Nourisher of all. Islam rejects the idea of chosen people, making belief in God and good actions the only way to heaven. Thus, a direct relationship in established with God, without any intercessor. Islam is not a new religion. It is, in essence, the same message and guidance which Allah revealed to all Prophets. Adam, Noah, Abraham, Ismael, David, Moses and Jesus (PBUT). But the message which was revealed to Prophet Mohammed (PBUT) is Islam in its comprehensive, complete and final form. The Quran is the last revealed word of Allah and the basic source of Islamic teachings and laws. The Quran deals with the basis of creeds, morality, history of humanity, worship, knowledge, wisdom, God-man relationship, and human relationship in all aspects. Comprehensive teaching on which, can be built sound systems of social justice, economics, politics, legislation, jurisprudence, law and international relations, are important contents of the Quran. Hadith, the teachings, sayings and actions of Prophet Mohammed (PBUT), meticulously reported and collected by his devoted companions. Explained and elaborated the Quranic verses. THE FUNDAMENTAL ARTICLES OF FAITH IN ISLAM The true faithful Muslim believes in the following Principal articles of faith:- He believes in One God 'Allah', Supreme and Eternal, Infinite and Mighty, Merciful and Compassionate, Creator and Provider. He believes in all Messengers of God without any discrimination among them. Every known nation had a warner or Messenger from God. They were chosen by God to teach mankind and deliver His divine message. The Quran mentions the name of twenty five of them. Among them Mohammad stands as the last Messenger and the crowning glory of the foundation of Prophethood. Muslin believes in all scriptures and revelations of God. They were the guiding light which the Messengers received to show their respected peoples the Right Path of God. In the Quran a special reference is made to the books of Abraham, Moses, David and Jesus. But long before the revelations has been lost or corrupted. The only authentic and complete book of God in existence in the Quran. The true Muslim believes in the Angels of Allah. They are purely spiritual and splendid beings whose nature requires on food, drink or sleep. They spend their days and nights in the worship of God. Muslim believes in the last Day of Judgement. This world will come to an end someday, and the dead will rise to stand for their final and fair trial. People with good records will be generously, rewarded and warmly welcomed to the Heaven of Allah, and those with bad records will be punished and cast into Hell. Muslim believes in the timeless knowledge of God and His power to plan and execute His planes and nothing could happen in His Kingdom against His will. His knowledge and power are in action at all times and command over His creation. He is wise and merciful, and whatever He does must have a meaningful purpose. If this is established in our mind and hearts, we should accept with good faith all that He does, although we may fail to under stand it fully, or think it is bad. THE FIVE PILLARS OF ISLAM Faith without actions arid practice is a dead end, as far as Islam is concerned. Faith by nature is very sensitive and can be most effective. When it is not out of practice or out of use, it quickly loses its liveliness and motivation power. There are five pillars of Islam: The declaration of faith: To bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, and that Mohammad (PBUH) is His Messenger to all human beings till the Day of Judgment. The Prophethood of Mohammad obliges the Muslims to follow, His exemplary life as a model. Prayers: Daily, prayers are offered five times a day as a duty towards Allah. They strengthen and enliven the belief in Allah and inspire man to a higher morality. They purify the heart and prevent temptation towards wrong - doings and evil. Fasting the month of Ramadan. The Muslims during the month of Ramadan not only abstain from food, drink and sexual intercourse from dawn to sunset but also sincerity and devotion. It develops a sound social conscience, patience, unselfishness and will - Power. Zakkah: The literal and simple meaning of Zakkah is purity. The technical meaning of this word designates the annual amount in kind or coin which a Muslim with means must distribute among the rightful beneficiaries. But the religious and spiritual significance of Zakkah is much deeper and more lively. So it has humanitarian and sociopolitical values. Hajj (Pilgrimage to Makkah): It is to be performed once in a lifetime, if one can afford it financially and physically  abuot islam https://youtu.be/Vp-6ofzUuVI http://www.islamtomorrow.com/  https://youtu.be/Euy1-3MrPrw  https://youtu.be/VfzwoyRAzVA https://youtu.be/BZjUYkjuuAc https://youtu.be/H5FXN4t3Ikw  Islam Question and Answer - En https://islamqa.info/en/",5년 전(수정됨),1,

Even then, early iron wasn't better than bronze in any practical way, except that it was easier to get, and therefore cheaper to produce!",4년 전,0,

You say that primitive tech has been debunked, but the real issue is copycat channels that are in it for the money and use tools off camera to make it look like they are doing more than they actually are (like those videos where you see people build entire pools with no tools), and some channels even re-upload content from other channels.  Primitive Technology is one of the only real primitive channels and have been doing this for well over 4 years, while all the other primitive channels have only existed for a year or two.  Here is a video I found (https://youtu.be/NvYO2EPiM4M) that shows the problem with copycat primitive channels  But even they start their video by saying that Primitive Technology is one of the only real primitive channels out there.",5년 전,5,

And mutations? What like on kind becoming some other kind? Nope no fossil records show this. It’s a theory which has been proven false. Maybe you should check out “Is Genesis History.”  Evolution is a myth. Evidence of a worldwide flood is explained with evidence. Stop listening to “experts” who are atheists denying truth of the evidence. All I can do is point you to knowledge. Wether you want to hear it or not is on you. God gave you a brain that can think for itself. Use the scientific method. Take in all the data before judgement. If they don’t have a good argument then fine. But if there’s even one chance God is true, wouldn’t you want someone to tell you there’s something else? You can choose ignorance, that’s your problem. Not mine. Peace",5년 전,0,

@adlirez,"Voi . Drv it took 150 days for the flood to come down. The part that talks about the flood coming out is described as the “fountains of the great deep opening up, and the windows of heaven being opened”, so that means that water was coming in from both above and beneath. I could only imagine what it was like for the water to come in from below, because I wasn’t there when it happened and it’s difficult to imagine (an earthquake-tsunami situation, perhaps?). The only thing I can imagine happening is a “scrambled egg” effect. With water coming in from both above and below, the world ends up being like a gigantic scrambled egg, like objects in a really bad flood. Sediments get kicked up all over the place. Rocks, boulders, animals, people— everything. Ever think of why anomalies like trilobites in the Jurassic-Period-levels of the Grand Canyon or T-Rexes in the period where trilobites were supposed to be in (I forgot the name)? That’s probably it. Maybe dinosaurs didn’t go extinct before humans came along. Maybe they got got kicked around in the flood.   Anyway, how the water went down. First, there’s the generic fact that some of the water got evaporated slowly or got absorbed a little more into the ground. However, the fountains are a thing, and I kinda wonder about that. Maybe the water slowly went back to where they came from? Maybe it took more time because of water logic? This is water that covered every single inch of land, including Everest, so naturally it would take a lot of time. It might’ve been a combination of the water evaporating from sunlight, water absorbing into what ground below that didn’t get wet yet, and a bit of a bathroom drain effect, where the water goes back to where it was at first, like an underground spring, perhaps? I honestly wouldn’t know exactly how the water went down, but I can make theories based on that description given on how the Flood came and some logical assumptions. I might be wrong with some of this, though.",5년 전,1,

I just get confused at times and it could have been answered if the subtitles were along the bottom of the screen. @primitivetechnology just letting you know so you can improve your videos! Out of these many comments, I hope that you see this and can learn how to do better edits on your videos to help us learn more.    Overall, I really enjoy your videos and am excited to see more. Please put subtittles because not only for the reason stated above, but also deaf people could be able to feel included so they can understand what is going on.    Thank you,",7년 전,0,

@radbug,"This is pretty damn sweet.   blooming iron all by yourself is a monumental task. mainly because a full smelt takes some 7 to 10 hours. That means you be yanking bellows for 8 hours straight? all by yourself? I dont think so.   But this Bow-Blower of yours is a significant leap forwards in achieving that goal.  I wonder if you could actually hook this up to something like, maybe a giant Pendulum ?    To do the Bow part for you?     then youd just have to reset the pendulum every couple minutes or so?     food for thought.",7년 전,0,

This is according to the Wealden Iron Research Group's website: http://www.wealdeniron.org.uk  ""If the silica content is too high, this will prevent a bloom being produced even when the iron content of the ore would be sufficient. In one trial we conducted using an ore containing around 30% silica, no bloom was produced, only prills of iron trapped in a viscous slag.""   Sounds exactly what we are seeing here.",7년 전,1,

Too bad we didn't see the need for rational, sustainable living as species, one which would have been based on harmony with nature, not on exploiting natural resourves to the point of extinction.   Your videos are unique on the way that human is in secondary role here. Nature, the process of work and primitive technology itself are the main points of focus, not the person who makes them. And how absurdly rare it is to find videos which lack speaking altogether. Ironically, this simple thing makes your videos a real pleasure for mind. A real treat for those of us who are so weary of humans and their neverending noise. Sincerely, thank you.",8년 전,39,

We do this, because we have taken all the surface level ore away to be forged into cars and swords and buildings. And deep mining drills.  A hypothetical post-apocalyptic Rome could not find enough easily available metals in order to experiment and progress naturally. A hypothetical post-apocalyptic 1700s Europe doesn't have enough oil in the entire world (that they can access) to develop deep-mining. Basically we took all the Easy resource gathering missions in order to build better tools to attempt Hard resource gathering missions, but because of this there isn't enough Easy missions to develop those better tools a second time. We are doing just fine, because we have all these hard missions (aka ocean drilling, massive pit mines etc.) but if we bomb ourselves back to the Stone Age we don't have the resources available to tech back up.",7년 전,0,

Then long trench connect to it, make it waterproof line it with clay start a fire in the trench, at the same time make the toilet bowl, use wood in place of plastics for the levers and maybe bamboo floats don't have to be pretty just have to work.

@GATETGAMES,"Телефонний дзвінок. 2:00 ночі.  - Привіт. Я тебе люблю.  - Привіт (посміхається).  - Як ти там без мене? Вибач, що так пізно ... - Так, нічого. Зай, я так скучила, коли ти вже приїдеш?  - Сонце, залишилося зовсім трохи, якихось пару годин і я вдома. Давай поговоримо, а то я за кермом вже 10:00, втомився, сил немає, а так твій голос мене бадьорить і додає сил.  - Звичайно, давай поговоримо. Давай розкажи мені, чим закінчилося твоя відрядження? Зраджував мені, напевно (посміхається)?  - Любаня, як ти можеш так жартувати, я так люблю тебе, що навіть не дивлюся ні на кого. А по роботі встиг ЗРОБИТИ дуже-дуже багато. Упевнений, що після всього цього мені, як мінімум, піднімуть зарплату. Ось. А як ти себе почуваєш? Наш малюк штовхається?  - Штовхається ... це мало сказано, не розумію, що я йому зробила. І, знаєш, зазвичай, коли чую твій голос він - саме спокій, а зараз щось навпаки розійшовся. А чому ти вирішив їхати в ніч? Відпочив би, та їхав, а то ... Ось як ти поїхав, розповідай.  - Ну, як, як: після останніх переговорів сів у машину, заїхав в готель за речами і рушив у бік будинку. Десь у другій половині шляху, години півтори назад, ти тільки не хвилюйся, я відключився, але буквально на пару секунд. Все нормально, слава Богу, але відчувши знову втому, вирішив тобі подзвонити, щоб більше не засипати.  - І ось як я можу не хвилюватися? Почекай секунду, міський дзвонить. У такий час, хто б це міг бути? Почекай секунду ...   - Сотникова Любов?  - Так. Хто це?  - Старший сержант Климов. Вибачте, що так пізно, нами виявлена ​​машина, що потрапила в аварію. За документами, людина, що знаходиться всередині, Сотников Олексій Валерійович. Це Ваш чоловік?  - Так ... Але ... цього не може бути, я якраз зараз розмовляю з ним по стільниковому.   - Алло, Льоша. Льоша, відповідай! Мені тут кажуть, що ти розбився. Альо!  У відповідь тільки ледь чутне шипіння динаміка ....   - Алло ... Вибачте, але я дійсно тільки що розмовляла з ним.  - Вибачте, але це неможливо. Мед експерт констатував, що смерть наступила близько півтора годин тому. Мені дуже шкода. Вибачте, нам потрібно, щоб Ви приїхали на впізнання ...   Як же сильно потрібно любити і хотіти повернутися додому, щоб не помітити смерть ...   Кожні 15 квітня вона з сином приходить до нього на цвинтар. Альошка - точна копія свого батька. І часто каже: «Привіт, я тебе люблю» - це був улюблений вираз його тата. Він знає, що його батьки дуже любили один одного, він знає, що його батьки дуже чекали його появи, він дуже сильно їх любить. А ще, щоразу приходячи з мамою на кладовищі, він підходить до плити, обіймає її наскільки може і каже: «Привіт, тато» і починає розповідати як у нього справи, як він побудував з кубиків будиночок, як намалював кішку, як забив свій перший гол, як він любить і допомагає мамі. Люба постійно, дивлячись на сина, посміхається і сльози біжать по щоці ... З сірої могильної плити посміхається молодий красивий хлопець, як раніше. Йому завжди буде 23 роки. Спасибі майстру, який навіть передав вираз улюблених очей. Знизу вона попросила зробити напис: «Ти пішов назавжди, але не з мого серця ...» Його стільниковий так і не був знайдений на місці аварії і вона чекає, що коли-небудь він обов'язково подзвонить їй ще раз ....   Ми Вас не обманули і показали продовження найбільшою подякою для нас буде, якщо ви підпишетесь на нашу Спільноту!- Файна Україна",8년 전,0,

@capnheadmuncha3952,"Ok, assuming that they were mixed in equal proportions, that gives approximately 67 grams of iron bacteria sludge used. So, you said that the iron produced was approximately 1 mm in diameter (0.5 mm radius). Assuming the specks to be perfectly spherical, 1 speck would have a volume of 0.523 mm^3.  I counted 11 specks, so net volume should equal 5.76 mm^3. We get the mass to be 0.045 grams (Using M=Density x Volume and appropriate conversions).   (0.045/67)*100 = 0.06765% so overall efficiency is about 0.068%. A little inefficient, but of course, it's primitive technology!  Could someone check the working for me? Please note that this assumes A LOT of values.",8년 전,0,

Handle and axle should be much easier to replace and last longer than cord. The main drawback is you will need to build a much larger blower due to slower spinning speed. Also you should ""cook"" your iron source first. Most of that is water and lots of fuel and material are wasted for that tiny amount of iron. Using evaporated remains should give a much better results. You can also consider finding bog ore nearby.",8년 전,0,

@Vectter,"Well, that makes sense. If the exhaust hole is larger, the air pressure upon exiting would be lower and you would have to make more effort to compensate for it. On the contrary, if the exhaust hole were smaller, the air would come out with greater pressure but would escape through other spaces. Perhaps by sealing the lower air intake with a better ""filter"", completely covering the top hole, reducing the exhaust hole and improving the blades, you could make it more efficient (like an air blower) to reach higher temperatures and with less effort ... https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Cross-flow_fan_schematic_patent.png",8년 전,0,

Much easier to implement this device on an industrial scale than bellows. During the middle ages bellows driven by water mills were used for iron smelting; coupling this device to a water mill (or windmill) in stead of bellows would have been a much simpler solution.  Seriously, given what you have accomplished so far, you should be able to produce workable quantities of iron without too much difficulty, if you would be so inclined.

And what material can be used for pouring crucible(is clay pot any good), as well as how to make wooden tongs for pouring liquid iron. -In that manner i would like to see him build a foot powered stone sharpener(grind stone) to sharpen his iron/stone tools  And after that, civilization evolution is pretty much self explanatory.

His use of a turbine fan is entirely modern and was never used by even those who were doing metal work in the ancient world. Part of the effects of our knowledge is if you threw modern men into ancient greece or similar periods you'd actually see even badly educated people mimic modern engineering that the cleverest ancient Greeks hadn't thought up yet.  So yea they aren't dumb, but our knowledge today is as much a product of a long period of handing things down so we don't have to invent them.",8년 전,3,
@fredex8,"BollocksUtwat That's well put and if you look at things like bronze, carbon steel, and gunpowder they were all things that were discovered over centuries yet most people today (I hope) would have at least some idea of the constituent ingredients and processes to make them. Even harnessing electricity in that situation would be doable solely because we know it exists and know a magnet and coil can create it whereas ancient people did not. Though what you could actually use that electricity for other than convincing people you were a god I don't know...",8년 전,2,
@BollocksUtwat,wasn't really improved until Reagon imo.  I bet you'd see steam power harnessed within a century or two and wide scale mining operations undertaken and a relatively quick uptake of more modern metallurgy creating tools necessary to have a revolution of sorts that could see lots of advancement in short order that would otherwise take millenia.  What would be required is a build u of necessary materials and knowledge to produce the materials among the labouring population but even a low pressure steam engine using inferior materials could probably revolutionize a lot of work.,8년 전,0,
@fredex8,+Cameron Lattz It would be interesting if he did some research and tried to do these things primitively. I don't know how practical it would be and it certainly wouldn't be easy but my point was more that with even a little modern knowledge it would be easier. Lodestone was apparently what was used for the first magnetic compasses but it must have taken a hell of a lot of experimentation to work that out and realise what was actually happening. Whereas if someone today found some they'd probably work out it was magnetic pretty quickly and what uses it had. Zinc or silver ore I imagine are pretty hard to identify but copper can be quite distinctive because of the green of the copper oxide. Probably why it was one of the first metals to be used by ancient people I guess. I'm sure getting any decent level of purity from it and creating wire for a coil without proper tools would be hard but it would probably be doable. It would be interesting to see if something like a lemon battery using zinc and copper could be enough for an electromagnet to magnetise iron to use for a makeshift motor and progress that way. Couple that with a steam engine and you'd have a decent generator... though not a whole lot of use for the electricity. I'd say building a steam engine that produced any decent kind of power could be harder than the motor though as you'd need a lot of good quality metal and an airtight build to get high pressure. Don't know how you'd do that without any metal. Bamboo insulated with clay as water pipes heated over a fire? That's a video I need to see.,8년 전,0,
@Undedproduction,"Anvilshock That's because he knows what a forgeblower is.  Recreating something you know to exist is immensely easier than developing a new technology.

@keith1241,"Almost any soil has about 10% iron per volume. I don't remember how it works; but, iron bacteria in an anaerobic (I think that is the correct term) can increase the concentration by a factor of 5 or 6 times. Hopefully Primitive Tech will provide a complete answer.",8년 전,1,
@asura.s.fury23,"As Keith said (and also as the Prim. Tech guy explained in the top comment), iron is present everywhere(~10%), it's just that the iron bacteria concentrate that iron into workable amounts (~60%), his nearby creek is a good place for that since running water brings more iron to the bacteria and thus it can grow in large enough quantities. Other sources of iron can be dozens of types of iron ore, but they're not surface resources (at least not anymore)(and not in this lush forest, it's more common in mountaneous regions) and many good underground veins are already being quarried and extracted by companies (plus i don't think he has the tools to possibly dig that, there's a reason why the copper and bronze eras were before the iron era), he could get lucky and find some ore (even if it's not of good quality) break it by force using rocks and refine it into tools to quicken his work. Another way would be to make a mine and hope to find some ore, but that is nearly impossible with stone tools, and it could result in nothing but a lot of effort and a large hole if he can't find any. Also, don't confuse iron with steel, or iron with metal: yes, iron is in steel, and yes, iron is a metal, but steel is an iron-carbon alloy and there are about 70 ""metals"" (if we talk about periodic elements) but you can't get most of them, and even less use them accordingly (they're impossible to obtain without proper machinery and processes and hard to shape, that's why we mostly use aluminium/aluminum and iron (steel) even with all the technology we have today).",8년 전,2,

Otherwise the uncertainess of nature would kill you. Try watching ""The island USA season 1"". They stayed like 4 weeks and this became an issue. A couple survivalists only does the bare minimum waiting to be picked up while others wanted to do more and conquer the island. Too bad they had the island easy, crabs deliver themselves to their camp every nignt. Wished there were storms, and lack of food so that those who do the bare minimum would learn their lesson. One of them didn't even bother making a shelter he just sleeps in the sand by the campfire.

@YodaWhat,"+Acrid +Primitive Technology made globs of iron, which requires a far higher temperature than basic soda-lime glass. His wood ashes are that kind of soda... Soda Ash (lye) and Potash. Dissolve the ash, filter it, air dry it to make the respective carbonates. Mix with clean sand and heat to about 2000 F for a few hours to make crude glass. Heat limestone in the hot fire to make ""lime"", calcium oxide powder. Add that to the wood ash. If borax or magnesium oxide is available, either of those can help too. Add lead oxide for leaded glass, but mind the toxicity of lead.  Also, wood ash dissolved in water can be used as a crude 'whitewash' to make his many cellulosic products (rope mats for instance) a bit resistant to insects, decay and even fire. Problem with wood ash 'whitewash': Even as the carbonate form, it's a bit too soluble in water for long term use. But calcium oxide powder can be suspended in water to make true whitewash. Like all such alkalis, it will pull CO2 from the air to make solid mineral forms, which are much less soluble than the oxide forms. He also has the basic ingredients for making lye soap. Salt thrown into a hot pottery fire vaporizes and makes salt glaze. Ground up bones can also be used to make glazes, or even ""bone china"". Waste heat from the fires can also be used to make charcoal more efficiently. The possibilities are endless.",8년 전,1,

@AndrewWayneV,Looks like he found iron bearing liquid. I believe someone called it iron bacteria. Using the bow to power a blower he mixed the iron bearing liquid with I believe carbon (ash from the fire) or ground up particles from when he was making tiles to create a clay mixture. He fired the clay in the furnace and it melted into a metal. I am thinking this is more a proof of concept to see if he has a viable source of metal to do future work with. Its a tried and true process. Make primitive tools to then use to make better tools.  If I am wrong can someone explain for me then?,8년 전,2,

@willg4802,"Have you heard of the Roman Hydraulus? You could take your blower one step further and use it to compress air. To do so you could make a large bowl with a hole in the center. Place a tube coming out of the top of that, sealing the joint somehow, perhaps with tree resin. Then you could make a large clay tank, or deep pit sides sealed with clay, to put the bowl in, upside down. The tube protrudes up through the top. Then you fill the tank with water. Air is trapped under the bowl as long as the tube is sealed shut. Then use your blower to pump air into  to bowl. A clay tube in the bottom of the tank, that leads to where the bowl is, would have to be made for this purpose of course. Then use your blower to fill the bowl with air. The pressure you achieve will depend on how high the tank is as well as how efficient your blower is. You would have a steady stream of air under pressure at any rate.",9년 전,0,

@woodendforager3240,"Have you heard of a 'trompe'? there was a lecture by Bill Mollison on youtube on it a few years ago but it got taken down. Apparently it was used in 15th century Venetian forges. A stream of water travels down a long shaft, passes through a 'V' shaped filter that is perforated with holes. This somehow traps air on its journey into an adjoining chamber, where the water sits at the bottom of the chamber and the compressed air gathers on top and can be released through a pipe and whatever fitting as compressed air. This can then be used to power devices, or a forge.  Additionally, the water that comes out of the system is completely clean and more oxygenated, encouraging more aquatic life downstream.",9년 전,0,

@MannyXVIII,although this only works because carbon (the charcoal mostly is carbon) oxidizes easier than iron ... the mor precious the metal the less it reacts with oxigen and if oxidized the more precious the metal the more it wants to get rid of the oxigen-load,9년 전,3,
@dharmawanlaksono4576,MannyXVIII will this work with any soil? I mean soil in my backyard,8년 전,0,
@MannyXVIII,"unfortunatly it doesn't. The soil in your backyard probably only contains a few mg of iron per kg of soil (even if you melt it down, you would 1. don't gain much and 2. have a low purity since the slag is hard to seperate from it without losing iron).  Depending on the type of soil, it is mostly made of clay, sand (silicon-oxides) and minerals like sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium ... and the minerals make together about 0,2% of the soils weight. If you ask me, it is better suited for planting trees and herbs.  If you want metals and don't find iron bakteria in a nearby shallow river/lake, ore is you safest bet. Malachite for example is a mixed crystal of copper carbonate and copper hydroxide whereas cassiterite gives you tin. If your nose can take it you could also meld down catgold since it is made of iron and sulfur.",8년 전,0,

In these the fan turned continuuously in the same direction either way rather than back and forth.    The historical primitive blower used ""bag bellows"", two animal skins with the animals taken out or a single animal skin over a clay pot that was pumped up and down by a pole attached to the center.    One way valves kept the fire out of the bellows and gave a more continuous fire.

The forces of ""natural selection"" don't take time out.

All you need is a box that seals light, a tiny pinhole to let a tiny amount of light in, then you need the photo paper which probably is the most complex thing to make but not impossible.  Boom, you got a camera, then you need chemicals to develop the film which must be taken out in a dark room or else you expose the film a second time. You need something that covers the pinhole so you can let the light expose for a few seconds and then cover the hole again.  Its not that hard when you think about it.",9년 전(수정됨),1,

@jerrywhidby5259,"So how much meat do restaurants and grocery stores throw away every day just so you are afforded the luxury of fast food? People want free range meat nowadays. Well it doesn't get any freer than wild game. It's funny that the right to hunt is only applied to indigenous people. All cultures have hunters. Obtaining food from nature is the right of everyone. Restricting that is absurd unless an animal is endangered. Like they say though, if you want to protect an animal find a way to put it on the menu. In other words hunters do a lot in the way of conservation. The money for hunting licences is also used towards that cause.﻿",9년 전(수정됨),4,
@jerrywhidby5259,"OK so he hunts the animal, then skins it, and preserves the meat with salt and drying techniques. He could also make use of the bones, and intestines can be used as a thread to sew the skin together. As long as he makes use of the animal then I don't see the problem. There are plenty of hunting shows on television. It's not a new concept. I doubt anyone wanted to see him take the life of an animal for the sake of entertainment. I believe I started by talking about the culture where who knows how many thousands of pounds of meat are thrown away each year in a wasteful practice. That would be of far more concern to me than a squirrel being eaten in one of these videos.",9년 전,12,

@georgeofhamilton,I cannot understand how little remorse most people seem to have towards animals.,8년 전,0,
@jerrywhidby5259,George Hamilton I have plenty of empathy for animals. Remorse implies a wrong doing. I do not torture animals. Infact I was raised by a veterinarian. He also taught me to dove hunt. We believe in quick clean kills. Anyone who has spent any time around hunters will tell you they abhor sloppy kills. I do not receive any pleasure from killing an animal. I receive sustenance for myself and my family. It's no different from people who gather food from the oceans. We show much more reverence towards the animals we kill than someone who shops for their meat at a grocery store. Since grocery stores don't freeze the meat they display it goes bad. Just like tons of meat is thrown away everyday at fast food joints. Those same people cringe at the thought of me hunting free range food. A bit hypocritical don't you think?,8년 전,0,
@georgeofhamilton,"Jerry Whidby Yes, that it is hypocritical. Now, the issue with hunting is that you are taking away the life of another animal, usually another sentient being with mental and social complexity relatively similar to that of humans, for your own wants. It is no longer necessary to eat animals to survive; in fact, it is easy to live very comfortably while avoiding meat. It is not right to cause the death of an animal for unnecessary food, let alone for entertainment, as many people here want, and even those who value the enjoyability of meat more than the life of an animal should feel some level of remorse.",8년 전,0,
@NotN8,"George Hamilton it may not be necessary to eat animals to survive, but you are will certainly be nutritional deficient if you do so. Yoy cant deny the fact that humans are ominvores designed to hunt and eat other animal for their  nutritionally dense meats. Let's name some nutrients you cannot get from plant foods: vitamin B12, creatine, carnosine, taurine, vitamin D3, heme-iron, the omega-3 fat DHA, and sulfur.",8년 전,0,
@georgeofhamilton,"NotN8 Most vegetarians do not have overall nutrient deficiency greater than that of non-vegetarians, and many in fact are healthier—although these effects can be linked to the fact that vegetarians tend to be more keen on nutrition. Even if that is debatable, it is incorrect to say that vegetarians must nutrient-deficient by avoiding meat. All of the nutrients that you mentioned can actually be either easily obtained in various vegetarian foods or produced in the body. While some of those are indeed not available in natural vegetarian foods, modern technology can thankfully fortify foods with them. Humans have evolved to be omnivorous, but the reason why evolution occurs is that organisms are pushed into unfavorable environments and thus experience natural selection, where those with beneficial traits survive at greater rates than those without them. Humans have happened to evolve from an environment where being omnivorous is favorable, but it is now possible to shift our diets drastically without causing problems with our health and without causing other animals suffering and death.",8년 전,0,
@jerrywhidby5259,"George Hamilton That is an admirable decision you have made. I do not have a problem with people being vegans. I really can understand some people's repulsion when it comes to killing an animal, or placing its carcass in your mouth. I find the thought of a human fetus being aborted abhorrent. I can wish for it to stop tomorrow, but that's not gonna happen. Still I respect your decision.",8년 전,0,

@jadon1979,Ok man... I've got a challenge for you...   after watching all of your videos I am curious if you could make a gear and a lubricant from animal fats or something else... if you could make those 2 things then you should be able to build a primitive sterling motor... if you could do that then you've eliminated the need to constantly tend the blower as the sterling could handle that for you...,9년 전,1,

@jadon1979,"A gear is the wrong choice of word there... a flywheel would be a better choice...  so you'd have a large cylinder of clay wrapped around a smooth piece of wood, to form, and cap one end off...  say that's 2' long... then you bake it...  probably best to add 2 slots on each side so that it can rest on limbs....  then you'd take that same piece of wood that you used to form it, cut it down to a foot... hollow it out, while leaving 1 side capped, coat it in some kind of lubricant and now you've got the plunger...  if a slot is carved on the outward facing end then you could attach a stick to it that goes to the flywheel... the flywheel has rope going to the blower shaft...    To make life easier the flywheel would have to be horizontal...  so the center is balanced on a pole... the arm coming out of the plunger could attach to the top of it...  If you modified cylinder to allow you to pour water in and cap it then you could effectively have a steam engine... obviously, the plunger wood would have to be coated with something to keep the water vapor from eating at it... and there'd have to be an opening that the plunger uncaps, when fully extended, but it definitely has potential.",9년 전,0,

It wasn't too valuable initially because of the difficulty to make compared to bronze, but once conditions were right to make use of it's most beneficial properties.    For iron, it's value wasn't recognized until we needed longer swords, and it's most significant improvement over bronze was it's tensile strength- you can maker longer swords without them breaking.  Another significant property was its abundance compared to something like Tin.  Conditions and culture were right for the explosion, and mass production ramped up.

@Plotatothewondercat,"To raise the temperature to a degree. Too much oxygen or too much heat would actually be a bad thing in context, because the bloomery process he's using to purify the ore into metallic iron needs the charcoal to incompletely combust in low oxygen conditions, releasing carbon monoxide which forms a reducing atmosphere in the furnace, in which it steals oxygen off of the oxidized iron in the ore, rather than the air, in order to become carbon dioxide. This thus produces pure metallic iron.  Too much heat and you'll actually MELT the iron oxides, causing them to lose the oxygen but absorb outright excessive amounts of carbon and produce cast iron, which is very brittle and cannot be forged. Too much oxygen and the charcoal will just release carbon dioxide, and will not produce a reducing atmosphere capable of purifying the iron.",9년 전(수정됨),2,
@hectarsavoie8166,"Kharmitas Dude, marvellous explanation, thank you very much :). I`m still trying to see how he will make steel, how will he insert Carbon into melted Iron without getting Cast Iron?",9년 전,0,
@Plotatothewondercat,"Well, the ancient Chinese method of steelmaking involved making a lot of cast iron and heat treating with very hot, dry, furnace heated half of it until most of the carbon leached out into the air leaving them with what amounted to wrought iron (later known in Europe as the finery process) before combining it with the other half. Steelmaking in other areas of the world used such methods as crucible steelforging, but one of the key methods in Europe was the production of pig iron, similar to cast iron, followed by decarburizing it either in a finery or, later, in what was called a puddling furnace, where the pig iron could be melted and stirred with metal rods and kept molten until it decarburized into steel, as it never came into direct contact with the fumes from the burning fuel.",9년 전,2,
@2adamast,+Hectar Savoie Bloomery like this are small scale and only produce sponge iron with much slag.  Where blast furnaces are bigger and hotter and able to produce cast iron.  The first blast furnaces here were used to transform thousands of tons of bloomery slag into cast iron.,9년 전,0,
@Plotatothewondercat,"Cast iron isn't immediately usable for tools that are put under stress. You need to put that through one of the processes that decarburizes it into wrought iron (the output of a bloomery), which won't shatter when struck with a hammer (cast iron will, even if hot). Or you make pig iron in the blast furnace and decarburize it into steel. It takes a large, complex economy to sustain methods that focus on smelting ore in volume and decarburizing the metal - like ancient china with it's iron uses (never developed the bloomery in China, but invented blast furnaces and decarburization in the BCs), or the past several centuries elsewhere.",9년 전,0,

You don't 'smelt' a bloom, but instead separate the now purified iron and slag by viciously hammering it to remove the molten slag, which is normally trapped in the iron instead of vice versa. The iron has already been chemically purified when it comes out of the bloomery, all that remains is physically separating it from the former impurities (mostly) and shaping it.

@MCwillzed,"I don't understand how he is going to forge the iron. Any stone hammer would shatter under when hitting the iron. Wood is barley an option as it wont shape the iron much. Casting would require an extremely high temperature furnace and would result in a very brittle blade.  The bronze age would have come before the iron age mean that bronze hammer could be used to forge iron as they would not break and the are somewhat durable. Bronze or copper/tin may not be available to him, which could have stopped this. Bronze is easier to forge as refining the ore is easier and it has a lower melting point meaning it can be cast with his kind of forge. Furthermore, bronze is pretty soft so it won't result in a brittle blade.",9년 전,1,

@MisterTalkingMachine,"This was very impressive. Maybe it would take you a lot of work to make considerable amounts of metal, but I was wondering if you could make (if crude) glass. Given that the charcoal can reach 1600 degrees (from your charcoal video) which is on the higher end temperature at which modern glass making furnaces operate at, my guess is that it might be plausible.  My guess is that you could try melting sand or crushed quartz mixed with some Calcium oxide (Aka, lime) which helps prevent your glasss from dissolving in water, and also lowers it's melting point.  The calcium oxide can be obtained by heating materials containing Calcium carbonate on a kiln to at least 825°C, this can be calcite, aragonite, limestone,  egg shells, snail shells or sea shells.",9년 전,0,

@angellazarocortegana,"TRADUCCIÓN:Publicado el 29 de jul. 2016 Inventé el soplador de arco, una combinación de la broca del arco y forjar ventilador para hacer un dispositivo que puede forzar el aire en un fuego mientras que ser fácil de construir a partir de materiales naturales que ocurren comúnmente usando la tecnología única primitiva. Empecé por avivar un fuego con un trozo de corteza de aumentar su temperatura. Este es el principio básico he mejorado en todo el proyecto. A continuación, hice un ventilador giratorio de dos trozos de corteza de esa ranura en ángulos rectos entre sí para formar una sencilla rueda de paletas 4 palas de unos 20 cm de diámetro y 5 cm de altura. Las palas del ventilador no estaban en ángulo y se diseñaron sólo para tirar aire hacia fuera lejos del eje cuando se gira. El rotor del ventilador se hizo mediante el fraccionamiento de un palo de dos maneras por lo que formó 4 dientes. A continuación, se inserta el ventilador en los dientes y el extremo atado a mantenerlo en su lugar. Haciendo girar el rotor del ventilador de ida y vuelta entre las palmas de las manos avivado el fuego. Pero sólo algunos de que el viento generado por el ventilador alcanzó el fuego. El resto de ella soplaba en otras direcciones, efectivamente se desperdicia. Así que he construido un alojamiento de ventilador de barro sin cocer para dirigir el flujo de aire en el fuego. Esto era básicamente una olla de vuelta hacia arriba con un agujero en la parte superior, una boquilla que sale de un lado. La vivienda era de unos 25 cm de ancho y 8 cm de altura. El agujero en la parte superior y el pico eran unos 6 cm de diámetro de modo que el aire que entra más o menos igualado el aire que sale. La base del rotor del ventilador se sentó en un zócalo de madera colocado en el suelo para hacerlo girar más fácil y la parte superior del rotor sobresale desde el agujero en la parte superior de la carcasa. Ahora, cuando el ventilador girar, el aire entró en el agujero en la parte superior de la carcasa y sale de la boquilla en el lado. Es importante destacar que, no importa de qué manera el ventilador gira, el aire siempre va en la entrada y salida de la boquilla. El aire es expulsado hacia las paredes de la carcasa y sólo puede salir a través de la boquilla mientras que el vacío en el centro aspira aire nuevo en la carcasa a través de la entrada. Una pipa de arcilla separada llama una tobera se hizo para ajustar sobre la boquilla para dirigir el aire hacia los carbones. Esto se hizo porque la tubería que toca el fuego puede derretir, así que es mejor hacer esta parte reemplazable. En lugar de hacer un gran conjunto de rueda y correa para intensificar la velocidad de rotación, he optado por una de 75 cm de longitud del arco. Hice un marco para mantener el rotor en su sitio consiste en dos estacas clavadas en el suelo con una barra transversal socketed azotado a ocupar la parte superior del rotor. Hice cuerdas de fibra de corteza y ató el extremo de un palo. entonces me enrollé el cable alrededor del rotor y sostenía el otro extremo de la misma mano que sujeta el palo. entonces me empuja y se tira el arco haciendo que el rotor a girar rápidamente, forzando el aire en el fuego. Hice un simple horno de barro para el ventilador. A continuación, he recogido las bacterias del hierro de color naranja de la quebrada (óxido de hierro), mezclado con polvo de carbón (carbono para reducir el óxido de metal) y la ceniza de madera (flujo para disminuir el punto de fusión) y se formó en un ladrillo cilíndrica. Llené el horno con carbón vegetal, mineral de poner el ladrillo y comencé en la cocción. El ladrillo mineral de escoria fundida y produce con pequeñas características, de 1 mm de tamaño de hierro a través de él. Mi intención no era tanto para hacer hierro, sino para mostrar que el horno puede alcanzar una temperatura bastante alta usar este ventilador. Un horno alto llamado bloomery se utiliza generalmente en la antigüedad para producir cantidades utilizables de hierro y consume más carbón, mineral y mano de obra. Este dispositivo produce un chorro de aire con cada golpe del arco independientemente de si se empuja o se tira. El arco hace que sea posible operar el ventilador sin el uso de un conjunto de correa y rueda complicado utilizado en sopladores de forja tradicionales. Hay una breve pausa al final de cada carrera en el que el ventilador se detiene para girar en la otra dirección, pero esto es efectivamente no es diferente a la explosión intermitente de un doble fuelle de actuación de Europa o fuelles caja de Asia. Los materiales utilizados (madera, corteza, fibra de corteza y arcilla) están fácilmente disponibles en la mayoría de los continentes. No hay de cuero, válvulas o juntas de pistón precisamente armarios son necesarios como con otros tipos de fuelles. Los cordones para este dispositivo se desgastan a menudo por lo que un número de copia de seguridad de los cables debe mantenerse a mano para una rápida sustitución. En resumen, esta es una herramienta fácil de hacer dispositivo que resuelve el problema de suministro de aire de combustión forzada requerida para hornos de alta temperatura y forjas.",9년 전,1,

I feel you could incorporate in the future, the same method you used for your pump drill item, and that it would be effective in this regard, also I think it'd be pretty cool if you added a window to the tile roof house, and maybe made an adjustable-height blind, or a window sill, to show you can spruce things up even in the primitive style. My thinking is a blind using wooden strips or split vines, and corded on each side, and maybe a peg and peg holes in the wall that the blind can plug into, over like a simple wooden pulley, probably harder to type my idea then picture it, anyway, you do an excellent job so keep doing what makes you happy man, and enjoy!",9년 전,0,

@Plotatothewondercat,"+Socrates Alexander Ancient people used copper and tin and made bronze first because you can find those things in their pure form in nature and learn about them independently of being able to smelt them. Iron, conversely, is not found in it's pure form in nature. That being said, the only people who started with ironworking by MELTING iron were the Chinese. Hence, their first experiences with iron were cast iron, which can't be used for most tools because it's brittle and useless.  The process he's using, for making wrought iron, doesn't even necessarily NEED to be blown. Just makes it run faster in some situations. The bloomery process actually works not by melting the iron oxides, but by raising the temperature enough that the rock and impurities can melt, and the iron oxides can react with the air...which deliberately does not have enough oxygen to completely combust the charcoal, thus rapidly filling with carbon monoxide instead of carbon dioxide, which under those conditions chemically strips the oxygen from the iron oxides and produces flakes of pure iron, which sink through the slag and form into larger, spongy masses, which the molten slag is beaten out of the pores of before the metal is shaped into a more usable form.",9년 전,4,

If youre going to be smelting metal using a forge/foundry kind of thing in this video, try making a small hammer out of stone for getting it out instead of using the wood.

After that youd have your own metal hammer made from natural materials/primitive technology which could be used to smelt and blacksmith newer tools/objects beneficiary to human survival.

@JacobMObrien,Its a relatively simple idea. using the mud and clay combined to hold together the iron deposits he got from the river side. (the red sludge  running down the side you saw) the forge (or furnace) heats high enough to make the mud and clay fall away leaving the iron to react with the charcoal and carbon to force it into the small bloom. I have to say I love the fan bellows idea. I've done something similar with my copper furnace.,9년 전,0,

You, Neil, are a rude self-indulged individual with nothing to offer but your judgement on people you haven't met and will never meet. you are the epitome of an armchair warrior/psychologist. please replace your head into your hind end and let us ""non-normal"" people enjoy this young man's work.

@telxvlogs538,+KISMO KIBO A diamond axe would be almost impossible to build. First you would have to find a big enough diamond. You would then need to flintknap or use a machine or melt the diamond to create the right shape. I am not sure how sharp diamond can get compared to obsidian. Not to mention you would be wasting lots of diamond by doing this. Flakes and dust would come off of the diamond and that adds up really quickly. It may also be really heavy so in that case the wood would need to be very strong.  Sorry for rambling.

@maxdecphoenix,"it's iron.  Have you ever noticed when something metal rusts, it takes on that 'rust' color?  That's from oxidation.  The ferrous (iron) metal molecules are exposed to hydrogen molecules in the atmosphere. The hydrogen steals electrons from the iron molecules, in a process called reduction, forming what is called an iron oxide.    Notice that that clay had a similar color to rust?  That's because it's loaded with naturally occuring iron oxides. All red clay have high iron oxide content, but 'iron bacteria' (that slime) has higher concentrations.   When he made that plug, he added charcoal and ash.  Ash is primarily the residual mineral content of whatever was burned. In the case of woods, it's mostly salt. Salt is a fluxing agent, it's presence lowers the melting point of iron.  I'm not entirely sure what the charcoal was used for, possibly as a reducer, but basically, when the iron oxides get heated, they start rebonding with free electrons, and return to molecular iron.  As they are in liquid form, if there is enough, they will collect into pools.  as they cool, they reharden.   Once you collect enough of these 'pellets' you could begin to try to smelt them into something useful. A blade for instance.",9년 전,0,

@Brasserie-de-la-Forge,"Brilliant! I really enjoy your videos. I know this is a hobby but the editing etc. must be a drag sometimes. I'm sure i'm not alone when I say i'm genuinely gratefull for the time you put in. I've done some primative forgework myself but I've never thougt about a contraption such as yours. Obiously you don't have a primative mind, there's some fairly complicated physics involved in that design. The fact that concepts utilised in state of the art turbines and jet engines can be realised by a lad in the woods measuring with a twig and building with clay is beautiful. I'm left wondering if anyone discovered this method in pre-history. In my part of the world 'bog iron' seems to have been the go-to resourse for lower temp iron processing. I understand it builds up over time as a result of the iron bacteria? I'm not sure if it's the same story in your neck of the woods, however you can 'hunt' it using a metal bar as a probe, poking into likely boggy areas (you'll hear the bar make contact). I'm sure you already know this but the tell tale signs of the bacteria resemble an oilslick or petrol in the water. (Many people think this is pollution). Anyway, cant wait to see what's next! Great stuff, cheers from Scotland.",9년 전,0,

It's easy enough to stumble upon copperworking by just finding and shaping native (IE, naturally pure elemental) copper nuggets, maybe accidentally melting a few. That being said, there are lots of types of bronze. Tin bronze could often be a tricky first step, because tin and copper are almost never found near each-other, and you've gotta stumble onto bronze production from there. That being said, if the copper source has high enough arsenic impurities, you can stumble on to the (highly toxic) process of making arsenical bronze, which has equivalent qualities to tin based bronzes, but is oh-so-much more dangerous to make.",9년 전,0,

@maxdecphoenix,"you notice when metal rusts it has that 'rust' color? That is because some of the iron molecules on the surface of the metal have come into contact with oxygen molecules which have taken electrons away from the iron molecule. Leaving behind iron oxide.  Now, notice how 'red' clay has that similar rust color?  It takes that color because of the presence of high amounts of iron oxides in the soil. (If you ever slake clay and filter it through a mesh, you will actually see A LOT of flecks of iron oxides).   When you see him make the block out clay, and what I am presuming is charcoal, and ash (essentially, residual minerals and salt depending on what was burned. I think it's primary purpose here is as a flux agent.)  When super-heated, the additives start throwing off electrons, and when the iron oxides get hot enough, they start bonding with the free electrons, and boom. Iron.",9년 전,7,

@MrElectricstorm,I personally would of made a turbine and had it spun by steam from the very fire you built. bamboo attached to a fired clad bowl with rocks on top would of held the pressure of the steam and also turn the turbine spinning the same in One Direction and fueled That Fire exponentially. now that would of been a hot fire that would of taken a lot of work out of the process in the end.. makes me want to build it to show how effective steam is.. R.P.Ms would of been so fast I imagine a pressure  blowoff would of been needed to control the wheel from spinning so fast it would of broken the bamboo air brake or shaft.,9년 전,0,

@SamuVielma,"Giedrius911G why would you call a 12 years old pubescent a 'kid'? Many teens older than 12 have full developed sexual body parts and thus are fit to performe intercourse, and surely, are able to get others sexually attracted. The thing is, Pubescents and teens are NOT kids. A child is simply not ready to have sexual contact of any kind, and it will be this way until puberty. Having sex with someone under the legal age have nothing to do with biology, like you implied in your comment. I'm not gonna explain to you why morality has imposed over biology on this particular case, there's no need for that, right?  Anyways, in your first comment you suggested homosexuality was a devolution and a disorder because it prevents humans to reproduce. You wrote that as if humans have sex only for the sake of reproduction, wich is bullshit of course. Then you go ever further still, claiming that 'pedophilia is closer to normal behaviour'. So here you are, telling people that feeling sexual attraction towards someone with undeveloped body parts is somehow closer to normality than being gay. You're so full of shit.  You might be trolling after all, wich means I took the bait, and I don't really know how to feel about it, because people who thinks this way are, indeed, a waste of oxigen.",9년 전,3,
@Quarksi,"I don't wish to incite further argument...however pedophilia is not natural. Pedophilia is attraction to PRE-pubesent children. which has always been taboo and an offense in most civilized nations. In fact marrying at the age of 12 wasn't as common as say 14-16. The more accurate term is ephebophilia.     One thing I never see people realize when they bring these types of things up...is that if you're willing to sacrifice someone else's daughter, then you must also be willing to sacrifice your son. Pedophiles have been known to be attracted to both sexes.  I for one would gladly replace all of the pedophiles of the world with homosexuals. It would be a great day.",9년 전,3,
@SamuVielma,"Danie F this is definetly some dangerous ground we're stepping in when discussing this issues. Though I've never felt attracted to a full developed 12/13 yo girl, I kinda understand if someone does it, biologically speaking. Of course, a young girl can feel attracted too, not only to boys her age but someone older also, her body could actually react to an sexual impulse ,so they are somehow AWARE of what's happening and might consider options. This doesn't happen with children, of course, they have no idea of what's happening and will only pretend to imitate adult behaviour.  So lets be clear that it's mostly our current moral values that kept us from hitting on young teens. And then there's a matter of taste of course. I, for one, do preffer women that are slightly older than myself.",9년 전,3,

@just4uamnda,Making primitive huts and tools from scratch using only natural materials in the wild.I also have this blog: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com/ (I have no facebook page- ignore the fakes) FAQ Q.Where is this?  A.This is in Far North Queensland Australia. Q.Do you live in the wild? A.I don't live in the wild but just go into the bush to make these projects. Also I camp out here occasionally. Q.How did you learn all this? A.Researching books and internet plus trial and error. I'm not indigenous and have no army training. Q.What about dangerous animals in Australia? A.The only really dangerous ones in my area are snakes. Care must be taken when walking about and lifting things from the ground. Q.For the mud huts what stops the rain washing the mud walls away? A.The roof. Q.Why don't you talk in the videos? A.When I watch how to videos I fast forward past the talking part to see the action part. So I leave it out of my videos in favor of pure demonstration.,9년 전,3,

When you need stored energy to power your blower (or whatever), you will have an energy source that works on demand.  You could use a ratchet and pawl to serve as a one way ""valve"" to capture the energy of the wind as it rotates the shaft of a pulley system that lifts the weight.  To recover the energy, release the pawl and allow the weight to descend while turning your blower shaft (or some other device, possibly a ventilation system for you hut, a friction by fire system, a lath, or a drill).",9년 전,0,

@piai55,"Great video as always, but it feels like you are cutting more and more footage in the last couple of videos. I would not mind a few more minutes of you just repeating a task (for example when gathering materials or forming the ""pot"") or footage of simple thing you have to do (like light the fire, throw more wood on it etc.). Im not sure if you film this stuff, but if you do, please dont cut so much during editing. (unless ofc. the majority of your viewers disagrees with what Im saying). For me your content is as much about learning something and being amazed as it is a helpful distraction to calm down and chill from a stressful day. That's one of the reasons why I would love to see more.

@Michael-kd1ho,"​​​ @commisaryarreck3974  Bronze is easier to make - it has a lower melting temperature than iron. It had two problems - it is softer compared to iron and steel, and the production requires tin in addition to copper, which is very rare. Entire trade networks in the ancient world existed soley to supply tin from as far away as Britain and Afghanistan to the empires of the Near East.  Iron is more common, and once you get the smelting process down, it produces weapons and armor both cheaper and better quality than bronze.",10개월 전(수정됨),0,

Last week I found pottery from 1100-1200 (medieval) and I figured I could reproduce pots by digging up some clay in my backyard. It was really blue but sadly it did crack, I should've followed the lead of the shards that I found, since there were ground up shells in there to prevent the cracking I guess. I had made some pots but most of them cracked. They did turn from blue-grey to nice and orange like yours however, great to mess around with stuff like that.

@JVHorvath1,so how much of the dirt he used would he need to get an ounce of iron?,9년 전,0,
@TheCsel,"not sure. it depends on how rich the soil/ore is. In antiquity they'd probably just locate an area that has surface ores rich in copper or iron, and then eventually dig holes to mine it. This source from the river probably isnt an efficient way to get it, but shows its possible if you dont have other means to get ore.",9년 전,0,
@abledbody,TheCsel You might be able to estimate it by knowing that that dirt happens to be iron bacteria.,9년 전,0,
@TheCsel,"abledbody yeah, but there could be variables that affect how fast the bacteria metabolize iron oxide, acidity, concentration, etc. I don't know enough about them.

You have the chance to make something big and bringing other people along would be recommended if you want to show everyone around the world how to survive without the accommodations of society.,9년 전,0,

That's the first time I have seen you use a tool to measure anything (unless I've missed it elsewhere).  So, I was wondering what other methods do you use to measure length, weight, volume, etc when it becomes necessary?  I never see any tape measures, scales, graduated cylinders, etc. Is it because, since you are using as primitive of methods as possible, you're also practicing primitive measuring techniques?  This would make sense because even the old imperial units of measurement like the inch and foot were based off human anatomy or other common things in daily usage. Also, are you an engineer by trade?",9년 전,0,

@holoduke51a,"It would be nice if u use the heat of the fire to turn the fans. You can make the first clay turbo charger.  I would be doable i believe.   From the current setup u need to make a iron axle and 2 sets of 8 iron/clay fans. You could try to make a clay axle and fans first to test to principle. Then u need to create a 50 cm long straight narrow chimney/pipe on top of the oven. it should narrow down to about 5-10 cm.  The very end of the chimney needs to make a full loop of 360 degrees. Inside this loop you place the fan with the rod axle attached to it..The axle is now sticking horizontally out of the clay.  At the other side of the axle you create a similar exhaust loop with a fan blower. With a new pipe going all the way down to the same spot where you blow the air inside the oven. Heat of the fire will let the first fans turn. The axle is rotating and turns the other fan as well. This fan will suck air inside the pipe into the fire. More heat will be generated. The fans will turn faster and faster.  You should play around with tube thickness, length, fan count and fan angle, but in the end you can create a massive turbo charged oven.  Use charcoal and you can melt down almost anything. Add a second exhaust pipe which you can open and close to reduce the power of the turbo and have the ability to lower the temperature. You need that to be able to extract different minerals.  ps. Placing the fans inside the looped exhaust pipe is tricky, but you can test by putting water in one side. If everything is correct water should not pass the exhaust without turning the fan.",9년 전,0,

You'd then pipe the very hot, oxygen-poor air from this first furnace into the second, larger one, where the smelting will actually occur. The hot air will drive it hotter and since it will be running very rich, it will produce more CO and reduce the oxides into metallic iron more efficiently.",9년 전,0,

Could you process several pucks at once or in a row but adding more pucks and more charcoal then collecting the total amount at the end of the process?  What are your plans for working this metal?  It seems like one logical next step would be to create tongs and a hammer for further metal working.  Or you could use a stone hammer and wooden tongs and create other tools you need.  Knife, axe, adze, hoe are all decent possibilities depending on what else you have planned.  Or even experiment with creating a saw for more precision with your woodwork.  Though your woodworking has been pretty high quality so far.  I am also wondering if a blower like this could be used to reach stoneware pottery temperatures.

@karasiofra,"It looks like he had a small handfull of metal from that run.  If he can streamline his process I think there is at least a chance he can get enough to make a tool maybe more.  That's why I was asking about the yields from the iron bacteria bearing water.  I actually think he is going to have an easier time finding iron bearing material than anything else as native copper is mostly worked out on the surface of the earth.  And he would have to have tin to make bronze which is exceedingly rare, that's one of the main reasons humans switched to iron.",9년 전,0,

Just make the a wheel that attaches to the drive shaft of your pushfan.

@inthenameofjustice8811,"Hmm. My scattered and unsorted thoughts on this?:  The question is, is the modern application of knowledge justifiable in a primitive technology? I think probably not and this is where the problems begin with trying to live a primitive life (albeit periodically) as a modern man. You cannot escape what you have learned. Any ""primitive"" invention you make is going to be tainted with your modern knowledge of forces, mechanics, chemistry and so on unless the ""invention"" is a copy of something that really is, primitive.  While it is true that living in a hut in the bush IS primitive compared to living in a hotel, even then it is relative. How much more primitive is it to live in a vast modern city if your home is a cardboard box under a bridge?  The application of modern knowledge to primitive materials is not really primitive at all in a pure sense.  A man armed with a slide rule and a good knowledge of engineering would, in the bronze age, have appeared to be a god. A super evolved man. In fact he would just be exactly the same as the other men around him with the exception that he has benefited from having the discoveries of others taught to him. He is not ""super"" man or, more ""evolved"" man. He is just, luckier man.",9년 전,1,

They could have been making metals gor thousands of years. but these types of foundries dont last forever. And even iron breaks down and rusts to nothing after hundreds of years.

@snookaone,"That was truly amazing !!  These outputed iron pellets may be very small, but they do seem to be made of pure wrought iron. These results were very nice for a first video experiment! Now, considering further improvements:  I don't think your choice for ore was a good one, specially considering you have mixed it into a cake with other ingredients. The iron oxide particles in it were mostly blocked from succesfully aggregating into a single mass of iron after reduction in the bloomery. Also, the layers of coal, ore and limestone should have been made in such a way that the reducing iron particles could drop to the bottom of the bloomery (therefore, the ingredients must NOT be in powder form, but rather in pellet form, otherwise their layers will actually block the falling particles!).  Regarding the choice for ore, non-commercial ammounts of acceptable quality Iron ore can be found almost everywhere in the world. This is the reason why middle-age feuds were able to make their own iron for tools. (i.e., Rattlestones were found scatered in the grounds of hollands forests and were manually collected). You can usually identify pellets of iron ore by their color. Rust-like color or metalic grey color are a highly positive indicator of iron oxide content. Collect some rocks which are mostly like that and repeat your experiment with these possible ore candidates -  you should soon know which are the very best rocks for iron ore in your region!  This can take a lot of time, but if you can improve this process to the point of actually getting a tool made, you would totally blow up the roof of the awesomeness scale in bushcrafting material! I've never seen anyone get to make an iron tool from scratch completely alone and without having any tools to aid the process!   Some good video sources for primitive iron smelting:  Smelting and forging iron in holland (Historical reenactment): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3rjjpuhCLI  Smelting and forging iron in africa (Actual footage of a succesful primitive method used for centuries - complete documentary about it): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuCnZClWwpQ  Best wishes.",9년 전,0,

You have to beat the impurities out, then reprocess it by adding the correct amount of carbon. Max carbon is around 2%; this is hard but brittle. Ideally you want this as an edge. Too little carbon it become too soft. ideally the core of a cutting tool or weapon has to be made of low carbon steel.",9년 전,0,

Once you have the knowledge (using carbon to carburize iron) you can melt and work iron at 1200, which can be done with basic tweaking of primitive furnaces that went to 1100 degrees needed for bronze. Iron can be found near the surface worldwide. Bronze required complex networks between different societies due to the disparate location of copper and tin deposits.

@nakedfaves4445,"I'm wondering if his intention was to build something that could be used as a forge............... or just something that would constantly stoke a low flame fire............................  Building a giant ""+ sign"" trench system would work just as well to maintain a low flame fire.   Just dig a ""bowl"" into the ground maybe 8 inches deep by 2 feet in diameter. This is where your permanent fire will be. Then run 4 trenches out in a N-E-S-W pattern running at least 3 feet in each direction from the middle of the bowl. Each trench should be deeper than 4 inches but no deeper than 8 inches. You want oxygen to be able to reach the interior of the bowl through the trench system but you don't want the trench system to be a new home for any animal larger than a mouse.   At the furthest end of each trench place a stick into the trench VERTICALLY so that you know where the end of the trench is and which direction each of the 4 trenches are running towards the bowl in the middle.  Then just cover the trenches with sticks that are laid out in a PERPENDICULAR pattern to the trench. Cover the trench with the perpendicular sticks starting at the edge of the bowl and moving out towards the outer end of each trench. Stop covering the trench about 4 inches from the outer end of each trench. Then cover the  perpendicular sticks with leaves and bark sheets, and bury the leaves and bark sheets under a few inches of whatever soil is in the area.   The perpendicular sticks prevent the leaves and bark sheets from collapsing into the trench, the leaves and bark sheets prevent the soil from collapsing into the trench and the soil prevents the sticks, leaves, and bark sheets from being blown away by any strong winds or collapsing any trench with sudden rain puddles. Burying the sticks, leaves, and bark sheets under a heavy enough blanket of soil will also guarantee that the walls of the trench don't collapse too quickly.  If you build a system like this just before the ground in your area freezes for the winter, you may even be able to use your campsite fire in the middle of a blizzard because the ground will have frozen solid by that time guaranteeing that the trench system can't collapse because the ground is now frozen for the next 4 -7 months. Placing a stick VERTICALLY into the furthest end of each trench will show you where the end of each trench is even after a blizzard does fall.   When you have finished building the entire trench and cover system, place 1 stick VERTICALLY in the hole at the end of each trench arm to let you know exactly how far out the trenches run and also let you know the line where the trench sits. This way you can walk over the trench system without actually stepping on any one arm of it.   Since you can't have a fire in a vacuum, as soon as you get a fire started, the trench system will guarantee that fresh oxygen is constantly delivered to the bowl where the fire is burning as long as you have enough wood to burn.   Even in the winter time the trench will still deliver enough oxygen to the bowl constantly so that even during a blizzard your fire will still burn until you run out of fuel to burn.   The trench system construction also guarantees that a constant supply of dry oxygen will reach your fire bowl even during a monsoon or hurricane that may be heavy enough to burn out your fire. If you can keep your wood dry before placing it on the fire bowl the only amount of water that would put out your fire is more than 20 gallons a minute.",9년 전,0,

Some information you might find useful if you try to make a bigger furnace: I noticed that the clay furnace you built around the fire ended up with some cracks from the thermal expansion. I saw a video demonstration of the construction of a traditional african furnace, and they circumvented this problem by mixing dried grass through the clay before constructing the furnace with it. The grass eventually gets burnt up, but the small gaps left throughout the clay allow the furnace to expand and contract without cracking. That way, there's less heat escaping and higher temperatures can be achieved.",9년 전,0,

@1jimmarch,"I saw a video somewhere about finding evidence of Viking settlements in eastern Canada.  One thing they were looking for was evidence of iron production using methods very similar to this.  Most of it would have been for nails to fix their ships.  He was holding ore for at least a few nails right there...or basic sewing needles, fish hooks, etc.  Doesn't take a lot of iron to be useful.  And if he's close to Viking levels of tech he's not far from all kinds of iron or low-grade-steel tools and weapons.  The charcoal will impart at least some carbon into the mix so at some point enough carbon gets into the mix to call it ""steel"".  Another old source of iron was meteoroids.  You get all kinds of legends of swords ""coming from the Gods"" and this is likely one source of those myths.  Some had impressively cool impurities that made the results border on tool steel...kinda random if you were an old-school blacksmith who didn't know what nickle or vanadium or such was.",9년 전,0,

@adolfhitmaker8639,There are trace amounts of iron in soil. With enough processing you can obtain relatively pure iron. Ever see the red clay in the southern states of America or in Australia? That red coloring comes from oxidized iron in the soil. Same reason the dirt on Mars is red - it's essentially rusty dirt. Process it enough and you can get iron,9년 전,0,
@martonlerant5672,"No, iron is not that rare. High purity iron ore is rare, and in some places like most of europe its even more rare, since people mined out most of the high purity stuff already.

@Oozywolf,"We've come a very long way. Heck, think about air flight. 50 years after the first flight on the Wright brothers' plane/glider they landed on the moon! Despite the huge amount of dumb people, even they are incredibly intelligent animals. I mean, look at an elephant compared to a person. We wouldn't stand a chance. However, with our intellect, we can end up killing one with ease. Humans are smart, and one of our smartest things was developing languages. That helps spread even more knowledge. Eventually, we get to a point where we can completely alter Earth's materials to create extremely hard materials and make weapons out of them. After awhile we develop guns and at that point, it's pretty much over. Any animal, even a whale if you could somehow get a shot, could easily be taken out by a few shots from a .50 rifle or an LMG. If you take our physical body without a brain, we suck. We can't run for shit compared to other animals. We suck at swimming. We can't climb well. We couldn't fight off a gorilla, so we're weak too. We're really lame when all is said and done. But you put in the brain and instantly we're the best living things ever, possibly in the entire universe. All those animals that are better at swimming, fighting, climbing, running, etc. are locked in rooms in zoos. We literally can study animals' behaviors and do whatever we want to them. It's sort of hilarious how awesome we are. Making guns really put us in front of any animal in just about any circumstance. So whenever you wake up, think about how truly awesome you are. You might suck at math or failed the 2nd grade. Doesn't matter, chances are we're the best living things that have ever existed. Look at what's going on here. Talking to a stranger through my laptop WITHOUT A WIRE on a video uploaded by a guy on the other side of the planet, in a building that no other animal could make. Look at a city and how unbelievable that site is: http://www.wallackmanagement.com/SlideImg/show6.jpg. Think about all the things going on there, from the boats, to the helicopters, to the construction of the tallest building in the USA.",9년 전,0,

Fundamentally, this system was working under the principles of a bloomery - the heat alone was nowhere near enough to melt and reduce the iron oxide in the ore, but there was little enough oxygen in the system that carbon monoxide formed and stripped oxygen from the iron oxide in order to become CO2. If he'd made pig iron, it would've been similar to cast iron in being liquid...hence puddling in the bottom. He's not getting anywhere the heats produced in a blast furnace.",9년 전,5,

Now they want us to want and believe in God. They want to use ""god"" as a way to control us. Back in the past we needed a God to have order, to make people look foward to something after death and also as a way of scaring people into being good. Now we are advancing and we are loosing faith in God because we know he is not real deep down and the government is loosing control.

Maybe make a lid to help trap heat for smelting... and deadfalls would be my best guess for charcoal. living out in the woods after a big storm or wind, trees will go down and sometimes the neighbors would be more than happy to see them removed from their driveway.

Its a long shot but not entirely impossible. At some point in history people had to get iron before large furnaces were envisioned and no meteorites were handy.

@rebeccamiller3248,"I worked with a group in Virginia. We found the relics of one of the original towns on the James river.  It was called Henricous. On public day, before it was built up like now. We used sheets of tree bark that was sturdy enough to dig clay from river, limbs and twigs, and grass to make waddle and dub walls. The roofs were made from tree limbs and lumber and thatch. I have also made a log house like Indians did using stone ax and grass house where we cut limbs using same ax to make frame and a canoe. Yes one man can do this without modern tools or help. It is hard back breaking work. Shows how strong and stubborn our ancestors were in fighting to survive just for shelter let alone food. As far as getting clay is concerned it is wet and you can dig it out using your bare hands. We were lucky we found thick sturdy sheets of willow bark to dig with. Least I think it was willow could have been maple. As for people today I think very few would survive because they tend to sit on sofa and use modern appliances not appreciating what they have until it is gone and no clue what to do without them. As far as the gentleman who does these videos, I give my heart felt thanks for his hard work showing us how to survive and thrive if we lose it all tomorrow. Thank you sir for giving us tips on how we can gain shelter, fire, warmth, cooking in an oven as well as flame, building a garden and other tools for survival without modern tools.",9년 전,3,

@jjjuser1,"I think, and I could be completely wrong here, but think of a belt around two wheels. Now, make one wheel, bigger than the other. As the belt goes around them the smaller wheel will rotate faster/more than the larger wheel. So for this you'd turn a large wheel a little but the small wheel (here the stick thats part of the fan) would turn a lot. This would be really cumbersome to construct in comparison to the simple bow solution.",9년 전,12,

@dariuso2657,"Cog wheels are really not that hard to make, it just takes some accurate measuring with whatever you have (using straight sticks for it would work just fine) and fine-grinding them to have least friction possible. I would think they're even easier than belt idea, because you don't have to make the belt and worry about it having enough friction to turn.",9년 전,0,
@Mikeztarp,"I'm guessing it's a wheel that he can turn by hand to make the rotor rotate using the same principle as pulleys. Think of it like a bicycle: you pedal, making the crankset (I think that's the correct word in English – it's not my native language), which transmits that to the back wheel through a chain. Replace the chain by a belt, and one of the things that rotate by the rotor with the fan, and I think that's what he meant.

The Iron Age actually should be called the primitive steel age as that is what made it usable for many things.  And of course metal working only one branch of advancement other civilizations could be ahead or behind in these other fields. Example Aztec and Inca civilizations are Rome level and thus in some areas more advanced than the Spanish of the time they just lacked the metal technology and riding and draft animals.,6년 전,0,

If you would do something like this, would you be afraid of diseases or would you just cook the meat really good in a custom oven?

Yeah.  So, they got the old guy to put together this type of smelter that hadn't been made or used since he was a kid.  They had like six guys pumping odd looking bellows for a day or two while the old guy put charcoal and iron ore in the top from time to time.  When it was over, they broke it apart and the scientists took samples of the metal for testing.  Yep, it was high carbon steel.",9년 전,1,

@wontaknoh6502,"translated kor 4 my kor friends  [의역] 굽는 덩어리의 구성은 철 박테리아(물에 자생, 외관상 오렌지색 점성 액체로 보임. 색은 철이 산화되어서 오렌지색) + 석탄가루(탄소, 산화철을 철로 만듬) + 재 (금속 녹는점을 낮춰줌) 결과물은 철 조각.  Then I collected orange iron bacteria from the creek (iron oxide), mixed it with charcoal powder (carbon to reduce oxide to metal) and wood ash (flux to lower the meting point) and formed it into a cylindrical brick. I filled the furnace with charcoal, put the ore brick in and commenced firing. The ore brick melted and produced slag with tiny, 1mm sized specs of iron through it. My intent was not so much to make iron but to show that the furnace can reach a fairly high temperature using this blower. A taller furnace called a bloomery was generally used in ancient times to produce usable quantities of iron and consumed more charcoal, ore and labour.",9년 전,0,

I think that you are using the same amount of energy for a comparable air output, It's just the way that you exert that energy. I would say that the push-pull motion of the clay blower can be compared to the box bellows. There might be a little air loss with the clay one, but I'm sure it is similar in regard to air output.

Pre-industrial britain definitely didn't have that. They did have the tools (though probably not fuel), they just had no idea that they could even do it.",9년 전,1,

@heronmyer3780,"ikkyblob you definitely could not unless you stretch the meaning of 'nuclear' to mean the sun or whatever. to get energy from uranium you need a reactor which would need either enriched uranium or some sort of moderator. the effort to mine uranium, process it into uranium metal or uranium oxide alone is beyond any possibility of a single person with not even metal tools. heck for him even making a single iron tool would be a big challenge. any claim to the contrary is just irrational exuberance brought on by ignorance of actual industrial processes.",9년 전,0,

@dalsio,"1. Having bits of iron and working those bits into usable tools are two different things. Depending on the exact time and location ancient civilizations in the bronze age would have had access to some iron. 2. The name Iron Age does not simply mean, ""when they had iron."" Terms like Iron Age and Bronze Age denote specific times in a particular civilization that happened to line up with the predominance of a material. Many other things signify an ""age"" including housing, music, religion, art, etc. Honestly, based upon his hut, his just recent development of agriculture and now barely delving into smelting, most anthropologists would probably place him just before the beginning of the Bronze Age, I'm just excited that we're getting so close to it.  The Bronze Age is where humans, especially around the Mediterranean, started to develop a lot of the basis for modern western culture. It's where towns and villages became great cities and empires. And also yes, it was when metalworking became prominent and I'm always a big fan of smelting and forging and casting the tools of peace and war.",9년 전,8,

@KarlKarsnark,"Why are people ""supposed"" to watch it? Read a book, learn from someone in person, figure it out for one's self. There are many options. It's not really the recording part, it's the pretentious ""primitive"" surroundings that are so absurd. There's no need to pretend to be a shirtless, barefoot primitive in order to demonstrate a completely pointless and impractical form of smelting, which is nothing more than a novelty in the long run. Particularly if one already has access to internet, electricity and the like. Not to mention the fact that any actual ""primitives"" would laugh there ass off at a silly bourgeois gringo willfully choosing to make things as difficult, laborious, time consuming and ineffective as this.

@baudeagle1,"Great Job, but rather than using the bow to spin the blower, you may consider incorporating elements of the pump drill (which you made) into the design.   The round stone would help would help maintain the momentum of the fan blade.  Eventually, you could also incorporate a treadlel to assist with the vertical action of the pump drill.  To further modify this you could then rig up a rock on a small pulley system to pull the pump drill back up into its top position.  So the treadle would force the pump drill down, spinning the fan blade, then the rock would pull the pump drill reversing the fan blade direction until it is again at the top of the cycle ready for the down stroke of the treadle.   Here is a quick and dirty drawing attempting to illustrate this idea.  http://imgur.com/uPtH6lG",9년 전,0,

I recently found pottery from 1100-1200 (medieval pottery) and tried to reproduce it myself. I live in the Netherlands and dug up some clay in my garden but sadly it cracked when trying to dry it. I guess I should've followed the medieval masters by doing what they did, put ground up shells in the clay. Anyway, the experiment did work as some tiny pots (where a thumb barely fits in) did turn nice and orange, where they used to be grey-blue before.

Eventually it was discovered that adding metal from another type of rock, tin, to the copper made it much harder and stronger and that's how we got bronze. Iron was known but only in it's already metallic state found in meteorites and so was very rare. Iron ore is very abundant and easy to find but humans had to learn how to make much hotter fires, using methods like the video maker is demonstrating, to eventually smelt iron.",9년 전,0,

Certainly if you made a continuous blower with perhaps slightly tighter tolerances (shouldn't be too difficult I think, though I don't know if it's quite necessary), and find that the clay can be fired at high heat without cracking; you already have all the ingredients if you can get more iron ore. Bloomery product is a royal pain in the ass considering all the work that has to go into converting it to wrought iron; what you referred to as slag is actually the bloom, which is what you'd traditionally start with. It would then be repeatedly beaten and folded and welded to drive out many of the impurities. You've simply also gotten the small little bits of purer iron that dripped out the bottom.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomery https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucible_steel  A good example of crucible steel, from a good video.

You jumped over the bronze age, the romans and the low quality metal age with this video project.  Thank you for making our secret survival dreams to come true. Most people would not dare to start such a project, but many us do wish they could.  Now let's see if you can make a decent ax or a hammer, or two in one. I think it till require hammering for condensing the metal, it's a bit hard, but even the soft metal version would be a good result under your conditions.

@ImmunityAnimations,"a lot of rivers will have clay deposits in their banks, the river may be slightly milky around it and the deposit itself is greyish or I have seen orange ones too, if this isn't helpful dried mud can do a lot of the stuff clay can do, you just can't make ceramic materials from it by heat treating like you can with clay and therefore can't be as hard or as waterproof, but is still stiff, water resistant and can provide structural support as well as retaining heat",9년 전,0,

@SagaciousNJ,Bronze can be manipulated at way lower temperatures than Iron. So i'm eager to see if high temperature iron ends up being a problem at this level of technology. I can already see the housing of the furnace cracking in this video. Then again it didn't require special materials to make so as long as your clay supply holds steady time might be the only thing holding back larger scale iron production.

@riddlemethis13,"I remember one time I went hiking in the mountains. I heard a noise in a bush, but assumed it was just a small animal. Once I made it to the summit, I was ambushed by maybe 20 of them. They took me to there underground monkey monk cave. I had to escape.  I was thrown into a cell with other humans. Humans who couldn't be monkified. It was cold. I slept sleepless nights for weeks. After a while, I got used to it. The food was the flesh of humans.  One day, I had enough. So I told my cellmates my plan. When the monkey walked into our cell to bring us food, I used the plate to beat it to death. I then released everyone and we killed a few guards. I was one of the few who had a weapon.  We ran out of there killing mountain monkeys. Many of us tragically died. Eventually, they chased us to the summit. Only five of us left. I thought I was fucked, when suddenly...  I felt a cramp in my stomach region. I had to shit. The food I was fed made me get diarrhea, so I aimed my ass at them and then they flew off the mountain. The force was so strong, that when they landed, there was an explosion. Luckily, I survived, but they hit an orphanage.  And that's my story boy! I hope you learned a valuable lesson. Never trust a mountain monkey, even if they offer you dead babies.",9년 전,0,

@Dragonmaw,"***** Nah, I just happen to read a lot of world history. Modern medicine and chemistry both stem from the Arabic Golden Age.  In fact, there's a very good anecdote I love about this. During the crusades, an Arab treated a crusader with a minor wound on his leg. He did so by washing the wound, making sure it was clean, disinfecting it with alcohol, and bandaging it.  Then a Frankish doctor showed up, took one look at the injured leg, and came to the conclusion that amputation was the only treatment. He took off the leg, sure enough, but the patient died as a result.  This isn't even close to the only thing we stole from the Muslims. A lot of modern knowledge is built upon practices and principles brought to Europe from Arabia by Italian sailors and traders.  The world is an interconnected place. No one ""race"" built civilization. We all did, regardless of skin color, one meager step at a time.",9년 전,4,

@jackknife402,"Not necessarily. The main difference between the iron and bronze age was being able to properly cast iron. You need expert control of temperature and carbon to be able to properly cast iron. During the ""bronze age"" people knew how the could heat up iron and reform it, they just couldn't get it to be a more usable tool than bronze, which was easy to make and required lower temperatures than bronze. In fact what is considered the ""iron age"" is more like the steel age, as iron doesn't become useful until you're capable of producing tool worthy steel from it. Which hand forging requires several more steps that include making pig iron.",9년 전,3,
@georgecataloni4720,"Depends what he does with the metal. If he forges something by folding the metal and banging it, then ya, he skipped the bronze age. However, if he casts it in a mold, then that's not far off from bronze age.",9년 전,0,
@Ex0dus111,"He has mentioned this before. There is no Copper around the area where he is. But there are the possibilities for Iron there, so he is looking to skip an age.  That being said, as +jackknife402 said, there is a little more to it then just smelting the ores, he needs to cast it somehow, and of course the next step would be Steel.  I'm sure this guy is hard at work trying to figure out ways to do it with his limited resources. One thing he has been avoiding is Leather, which I think could make a lot of things a little easier, but then again that requires hunting and killing and a license, so its most likely not something he wants to get into.",9년 전,0,

@eyesofphysics97,"Fantastic job! The only issue I see here is that the air has no streamlined intake. The top intake method only works if the blades are all angled so that the air is sucked into the fans. Also, the exhaust should be on one side of the fan, tangential to the center. For an example, you can see how a turbocharger looks.  I would suggest two openings that are both tangential from the center of the disc; one towards the fire and one away from the fire. Use the same fan blades you are using now, and use a belt drive to a large wagon wheel shape that is 2-3 feet away. Finally, put a crank handle on the wheel, and spin it in one direction. This should ensure efficient and continuous airflow.",9년 전,0,

@jackknife402,"He can actually make electricity right now. All he needs is to make a small clay vessel, fill it with some sort of acid, citric or whatnot would work, and insert a lead plate. Then attach two diodes to it and run copper wire from the diodes. However he's correct in needing a bloomery. Bog Metal, which is one of the terms for which he produced his ore,  produces a lot of slag but very little usable metal. In a bloomery you can produce higher amounts of iron, and can even refire the slag leftover from the bloom for more iron in a later batch. For the copper wiring and diodes he'd need to find a source of copper, as iron doesn't conduct well enough to work properly.   Another way to create electricity would be making a copper housing, and iron wire and spooling it up and running it inside the copper housing to make a turbine. Once you master fire and are able to extract metal from the earth from its use, you can do anything.",9년 전,0,
