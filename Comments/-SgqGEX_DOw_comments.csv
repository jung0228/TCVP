It brings a closeness and level of intimacy that you cant experience any other way. Everyone deserves that kind of closeness with someone they love.

Knowing you were able to assist and give what they need and can't do on their own. I would do it with no embarrassment no judgement. I hope more disabled couples are able to adopt this into their lifestyle. Honestly think about it if you were in their position wouldn't you want the help? I don't see how that sex therapist is able to even sleep at night for charging them so much for one hour or two. Who the hell makes $300 in 1 to 2 hours? Seems like that therapist was taking advantage of them knowing that they had no other way of being sexual.,7년 전,0,

@reneelemos909,I originally marked i didnt like video but once i got passed how uncomfortable i felt. I realize it's not about me it's about two people who love each other and unfortunately they have disabilities and can't allow them to have what we call a normal relationship. I am a caregiverof a 98 year old woman who if she ever did want to have sex with anyone I would totally respect her wishes.  i would do my best to find her a companion. I think that like anybody else they just want to be held and loved cared for and respected. Why not have sex its their bodies and they obviously have the right frame of mind to do so. I wish them the best of luck and kudos to their assistance.,7년 전,1,

Think how often we adjust when getting into a sleeping position but now imagine you had to ask someone to do all those adjustments for you.

It’s awesome they’ve got the help they need to be sexual with each other and can also allow themselves to accept the help. I’m open sexually on an intellectual and political level with an attitude that’s nonjudgmental and the thinks that it’s no one business what ppl do as long as the parties involved are consenting, are able to consent bc they are of age and conscious and are able to express that consent in some way. Unfortunately on a more personal level I’m super repressed. I’ve tried really hard to move past that repression. I’ve had tons of sex with lots of different ppl of both genders that sometimes involved more then one other person. But I’m till super uncomfortable with my sexuality. I finally pretty much gave up. I’ve been celibate for a few years now and find sex even more ridiculous then ever. Idk maybe I’m to damaged from the traumas I’ve experienced. I just pretty much stopped worrying about it. But even though watching real ppl be sexual makes me uncomfortable I’m really glad these ppl are able to express their sexuality even with disabilities that makes sex for them less private then it is for the majority of us.",7년 전,33,

@BomBomBussy,"11:52 I really enjoyed watching this, I understand everything she’s saying but I never thought people with disability would feel oppressed like that. I work in a company for the disabled that does not allow sex and after watching this I realized that no one should have any say so in our clients sex lives! I feel like sex is natural so who are we to tell them what they can and can’t do? This also irritates me because one of my clients has a girlfriend he’s been with for 10 years and he never even been able to kiss... I can only imagine the build up frustration :/ I wish companies would be a bit more open minded in how they could possibly be feeling, I like her confidence as well but not everyone is comfortable enough to come out and say something especially people with disabilities. This makes me want to make a change.",7년 전(수정됨),81,

@kayceegreer4418,"I don't know about in Germany but in America when you work as a health/nursing aide it is your duty to help in sexual health matters also.  But it seems many people all over the world have a problem aiding handicapped people. I have no qualms and have in my tenure as an aide, aided when necessary, couples in their efforts. I also have had a serious boyfriend that was a quadruple amputee and we were met with much opposition and discussion and lack of privacy and all of a sudden, Mark was chided, and I was sick & twisted for holding hands with him (prosthetic hooks were what he had for hands) and for wanting to have sex with an amputee! There were snarky things said about what I did with his below elbow stumps! Seems to me those people were the ones who were sick.  Without ever discussing it Mark knew and felt that by my holding his hook I was accepting him- all of him and he loved me all the more for it. It was not a conscious decision on my part, his hooks are what he has for hands so I held hands with my boyfriend that's all!  He told me he was greatly boosted by that , gave him confidence. Whether in his his mind or in what was left of his arms, he felt my touch when I touched his hooks or whenever I placed my hand on his ""forearm"". He marvelled that I was so casual, but when you love, you want to touch. Simple.",7년 전,0,

Love and cherish the life you’ve been given not everyone in this world is as lucky. I feel for these people, and I thought my condition was bad, as I was born with dislocated hips and was born at 2 pounds. I have very limited range of motion in my hips. Iam married and was blessed to have a son, but sex even for my husband and I was and is still is hard due to my condition I can’t open or spread my legs to any degree because of the metal in both of my hips, now I’ve been told by doctors I can go in and have a complete hip replacement but they can’t promise any positive results. When I found out I was pregnant, I had to have a csection. No way, I could have a vaginal birth since my legs don’t come open much. And second having a natural birth puts me at risk of breaking my pelvis and hip bones. So I have my issues, like these folks but I can honestly say I’ve been blessed that I have two legs that can walk with, Iam able to have sex just not in the way we all define as “normal position” thankfully there are other many ways to “do it” and we use those “ways”. And lastly, Iam so blessed to have a son who is now 8 years old and is as normal as can be and weighed 8 pounds at birth. I am also thankful to have such an understanding and patient husband who loves me for me. Do I have difficulties, of course. As bad as these people, not at all. I should really count my blessings and what god has given me. I hope these two live as normal as life and bedroom life as they can. ❤️",7년 전,0,

I have become Disabled a few years ago, but I'm not this bad off, but sometimes I need help getting out of bed in the morning, because sometimes when I wake up, I'll have severe arthritis and suffer from chronic back pain, I have a bulging disc in my lower spine and I have Degenerative Joint Disease, which means that my bones are deteriorating, so I feel bad even asking for help just to get out of bed, but I know that I can't help it...my neurosurgeon said back in 2003 that my bones are 10 years older than I am, so imagine now that this is 2017 and things have only gotten worse, they'll continue to get worse, I have fear of becoming totally Disabled, meaning that I'll always need help with everything I do.

Being disabled is a very humbling thing, and you learn that the little things in life truly do matter the most. I may have a different way of living my life now, needing to depend on others for mostly everything, but I feel so blessed to wake up each day and I'm so thankful for what blessings I DO have.

I think this couple is pretty inspirational and should keep pushing for services like what they need to be intimate.

@Catlitter84,"This video was a random find but I’m so glad I stumbled across it. I’ve read the comments and most are positive, even the ones that said that this made them laugh. Sex between a loving couple able bodied or not can be a funny thing and should be joyous, it’s good to laugh and play. Laughing at this in a negative way though is just childish and pathetic. I am already aware that there are professional sex workers that specialise in working with non-able bodied people but it made me quite sad that this couple had to pay a lot of money for help with vaginal intercourse. I’m not sure what the answer is to enable this couple to enjoy each other as much as they want to and that is something they as a couple need to figure out but surely there is a way without them having to pay so much money. The first step to resolving this issue is rid it of its taboo status. Sometimes sex is nerve wracking, sometimes it’s hot, steamy and passionate, sometimes it’s funny, sometimes it’s experimental.  However no matter who you are, sex is a perfectly normal, natural and beautiful thing.",7년 전,36,

@markorollo.,"Just want to make a point on here because I think some people are thinking it, not all people with disabilities need assistance, or 'surrogates' for doing the boingy boingy thing, like me, I was born with spina bifida, can't walk, but no help is needed when the chance arises (as well as something else 😉). I mean if an assistant (female) happened to be there and was a bit of a looker I would be like 'fancy a menage a troise?'. Other than that I'm sure myself and my other half could cope by ourselves, speaking of other halfs, I think my biggest problem is not taking the chances when I get them, had one years ago, stunning woman, able bodied, nothing 'wrong' at all, someone other men liked,  and she asked me!!!.... And I didn't take the chance for a couple of reasons, but regretted it ever since, I've got to stop doing silly things like that... Also, might just be me but I find calling these two cute kind of patronising, they're not babies, maybe I'm taking it the wrong way though...

@crazyhai6554,"@Angel of Death  To be honest, I think it depends on the person. Everyone is different, in how much 'sexual energy ' affects them (with disability not affecting libidos).  I'm an 'able-bodied' woman in my 30s. I enjoy sex, and I get horny. But I've never felt overpowered by my libido.   I've sometimes found romantic feelings overwhelming, and hard to control. I was absolutely crazy in love with one particular person for a long time - lots of sexual energy and thoughts too (probably more than in any other relationship). But even then, it was the romantic feelings that were the strongest, and hardest to control. Not the sexual ones.  Of course, my experience doesn't mean this brave lady doesn't have a far more powerful libido than me (as do some other women - disabled or not).   But I think in GENERAL, men have a far harder time than women, dealing with their sexual impulses. A lot more women (than men) can take sex - or leave it.  I once went years without it. I can't imagine  being in emotional agony over sexual impulses.",7년 전,2,

This is extremely gross and the thought of positioning people because they CAN'T is somehow beautiful and commendable just shows how distorted we are to no longer call things what they are because everything has to be accepted or there is something wrong with you.  I think anyone with genes that cause horrible conditions even those who don't need to be positioned  shouldnt reproduce because it is not ok to pass that on.
