The USA is basically 50 different regions with their own dialects and food traditions.

I didn't know the Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps was from Baltimore until I watched him being interviewed. For example, there's a big different between a Downeast Maine accent & a northern Mainer (Aroostook County) where many folks have a bit of a Quebec-French dialect. Northern Florida sounds completely different from the Gold Coast, which has a hodgepodge of Caribbean & Latin American migrants plus many Canadian & Yankee snowbirds, at least until Trump scared them away. Cajuns & Creoles are another contrast, east versus west in southern Louisiana. Michigan versus Minnesota: big diff. Southern California versus the ""Inland Empire."" Many Brits may know the southern Cali sound thanks to American TV & Hollywood. I'm from NY; tons of accents here. What these kids did was to scrub out their British public school affect & produce a great but generic US voice. Especially the first ""bloke."" They don't speak like that in Alabama, Ohio, or Alaska. Many young folks scrub out their rural accent once they move to the ""big metropolis"" for school or work. No one wants to sound like a slick hick. It's too bad, really.",4개월 전,0,

Why buy and store an extra appliance only to have to wait that long for your tea water, when you can boil the water in the microwave (that practically everyone already has) in just 2-3 minutes?

@TheArbiterOfTruth,"@ the full breakfast. I liked it! I had someone make it for me homemade, and got it in 2 different restaurants.   Hmmm. Good question. While I grew up in Georgia, neither of my parents are originally from here, so we grew up eating mostly my mother’s food (Cajun). However, many southern dishes transcend lines. I’d try red beans and rice, biscuits and gravy, cheese grits (or shrimp and grits).",10개월 전,1,

@emmef7970,"Americans cut or break those biscuits in half, and not only pour gravy over them but and assortment of other delicious things ie: jams, preserves, jelly (which is not Jello) honey, and no doubt a multitude of other personal favorites. Have a friend that splits them, places a tomato slice and bacon or a sausage patty on each piece and places them in the oven until the cheese melts and has a bit of color. They are also used to make breakfast sandwiches with fried eggs, bacon or sausage and cheese at home, fast food joints and restaurants. They make great cinnamon rolls, bread pudding and strawberry shortcake. And don’t forget the overindulgent chocolate gravy. There is a multitude of uses for biscuits. They are simply just limited by one’s mind.  Take chicken for example, instead of maybe 10 ways to serve it, Americans, have thousands+. And, people are still creating new recipes. It just may be an obsession we have with “choices”. And, the fact that most of us enjoy eating and trying new foods, new recipes. American’s are just more creative and experimental in the kitchen. Where Brits are for the most part traditionalists when it comes to food, which is fine. I’m just glad I’m American, I love choices, lots and lots of variety. lol.",1년 전,0,

@Kpop_Got_My_Back_127,"I am an American who passed in social studies here. I think the reason why they don't understand what we do and say and Vice Versa is (obviously if you live/have American or British in your DNA) is because our history with them and them with us having the wars that caused the U.S. to become independent/separate from the U.K. a long time ago. I'm guessing we (the U.S.) inverted/renamed anything British related to cut ties to the dark U.S. history with the U.K. So why we say/do things that they wouldn't probably just stems from having rewrote their way of English as our own way.

They are a regular metal teakettle, and we take the lid off of them fill them with fresh cold water, replace the lid, and put them on a burner on our range top, or cooktop and bring the water to a boil. Me personally, I like tea, I use loose tea, and bagged tea and 99% of the time I make my tea in an actual teapot… A ceramic teapot, of which I have several and one of them was actually made in England. I take the boiling water from the stove burner And pour it into my teapot over the tea leaves and allow the tea to steep for a few minutes and then enjoy it either hot or iced.   I have no desire to ever buy an electric water warming device to sit on my counter simmering the water till it’s just polluted with mineral deposits. No thanks.

Once boiled, take your cup, be it a thermos to keep it warm, or an average mug or cup so it can cool down, and put your tea bag(s) in the cup, then pour the water into the cup from the kettle or pot.  Wait for 4 minutes for it to steep.  Once steeped, wrap the string around the teabag on a spoon, and squeeze the tea out into the cup, then throw away the teabags(or save them for later, if that's your cup of tea).

Years ago, I found out this ""bisque"" had been brought to Brazil by American immigrants during civil war. They were confederates who were running away and brought some southern habits. So, it hit me that ""bisque"" was originally ""biscuit"", pronounced in a Brazilian way, and every mom that knew how to bake them was an American descendant or a friend of an American descendant. Then I came to the UK and discovered ""scone"". I thought, ""hey it tastes like bisque"". Now I know that bisque is the Brazilian version of biscuit, which is the American version of scone.

I don't like scones. To me they're just too dry and maybe I've just had bad ones.  Biscuits are crispy on the outside but nice and soft on the inside.  Because they're made with so much butter.  I've already seen the other video where they got to taste the biscuits and gravy.... So stop making those faces boys....

The true fatties like myself put jam on the breakfast biscuit sandwich. Grape, strawberry, or raspberry all go so good with the sausage or bacon.

Barbecue is an entirely different kind of cuisine in and of itself, that cannot be explained in a Youtube Comments thread, without said thread hitting some arbitrary character limit!    Also, the English Breakfast there, I'm American and I can tell you that I would eat every single bite of that plate...  except those cruddy, pathetically sub-par, ketchup beans.  Make my beans Molasses Baked Beans, or some kind of hardier Baked Beans...  not that Bri'ish ketchup beans malarke;, those things aren't even fit for children to eat.  Nasty.    Also, the kids grossing out over the Biscuits and Gravy...  ya'll still eat Chipped Beef on Toast.  Guess where we got our Sausage Gravy (also known as Saw Mill Gravy) and Scone like Biscuits from.  From Chipped Beef on Toast sucking so badly, so we made it differently and it is superior to your Chipped Beef on Toast.  :-)    Lastly, we do have Kettles here in America.  Some folks have gotten electric kettles, like Jet Boil for example, but that's because they have experienced them in Britain and bought one online.  The majority of houses in America do not have a kettle...  unless...  you are in The South.  Down here in The South, many homes down here do have a kettle...  a stove top kettle.

Most of us down here don't have a dedicated kettle just to sit on the countertop, and most folks that drink hot tea down here are old Southerners, and most live in places like Charleston or Savannah where Hot Tea was always a staple of folks' lives there.  Hot Tea has fallen out of style for most of the USA in favor of coffee or (*shudder*) soda/pop/soft drinks.  However, some of us ain't a bunch of heathens and still like hot tea now and a again...  or quite often in some of our cases.  For some of us, hot tea is our coffee, because some of us hate the taste of coffee.  But yeah, most of The USA doesn't do Hot Tea.  Your jerk of a king way back in the 1700's taxing it to the point no one could afford it ruined that, and then we found coffee.  That's why.  The Boston Tea Party changed more than some tax codes...  it started a war, sent a message, and changed an entire culture literally forever!",2년 전(수정됨),0,

One which never caught on in the colonies. But it stuck in Britain and the Isles.  So Americans largely speak English with the accent the British used to have before about 1750 or so.

@lyndseymc," @ThexxM  I’ll gladly save you from that torture! It was the 2nd boy. The original commenter listed them in order.

The accent is actually standard American English, a news broadcaster accent or the “California accent.” We speak the same accent in Florida, too. What makes it valley girl is the way he drags out the last word,  “arouuuund” and then throws in that useless “like” at the end. The “likes” are everywhere in the US now. Even grown men say it.   FYI “valley girl” is an old term. I’m not sure many under 25 would know it. Could be wrong about that. Truly though, go watch some clips of Clueless (a 90s adaptation of Jane Austen’s novel Emma).

@beasley1232,"​@lindphoenix2849 Actually, the American Midwest and Southwest was founded by the French and Spanish. And only 11.6% of Americans are of British descent, or about 34 million Americans out of 340.1 million Americans.  For comparison, 12.1% of Americans are Mexican-American or of Mexican descent, or about 35 million Americans. 14.1% of Americans are African American or about 46-47 million Americans, and 13.5% are German descendants, or about 41 million Americans.  American accents were heavily influenced by other European immigrant groups, like the Italians, German, Yiddish etc and of course more recently Spanish from Latin America. And example - Chicano English. An American dialect shaped by Spanish rhythm and intonations. Chicano English tends to lean into a more syllable timed rhythm like in Italian and Spanish, rather than the stress timed rhythm of English.",1개월 전(수정됨),0,
@Bellephrontos,"​ @beasley1232  I know those statistics but let's be honest, the majority is actually of British origin. Because there is also this category called ""white American"". Those are probably the oldest settlers, who don't identify as British, but actually are",1개월 전,0,
@beasley1232,"​ @Bellephrontos Nope. You are incorrect. According to US 2020 census data, about 23 million Americans identified with English descent and only 2 million of Scottish descent. About 17.8 million Americans identified as just American.  There is no guarantee that all 17.8 million people who identified as American are of British decent. But if we were to add them all together assuming ALL 17.8 million are of British descent, their total population would only be 41-43 million. Or about 13.1% to 13.5% of the US population. Nowhere near majority status.",1개월 전,0,
@Bellephrontos,"​​​​ @beasley1232  I mean it was a British colony and the USA has always stayed a British-culture country. I think they are still the biggest group?   It's always one thing how somebody identifies and another thing what the actual truth is.   Also if e.g. one person has a German mother and a father who can trace his lineage back to 1750, what if the child identifies as German, simply because they can be more sure about it, because the father's lineage goes too far back to track?  I don't think there has ever been an actual genetic study? Probably it's all just self-identification.   Some groups are more dominant when it comes to identification bias too. Imagine someone has a father from a muslim country. Probably they will put a lot of emphasis on their middle eastern heritage and much less on their European heritage, because Europeans just don't care that much.  So that distorts any statistics . And the groups that care the least are probably White Americans and African Americans, because they have been in the country the longest, while everybody else felt more like an immigrant",4주 전(수정됨),0,
@beasley1232,"​​​​​​ @Bellephrontos Nope, you are still incorrect, they are not the largest ancestral group in the USA. That would technically be Mestizos people mixed Spaniard. There are 68.3 million Hispanics/Latino's in the USA, about 70% of them identify as white aka Spanish descendants. Only about 41 million Americans would be of British decent and thats if we include all 17.8 million people who identify as Americans as British descendants. German would still be larger at around 43 million, and African Americans at around 46-47 million.  The USA is also extremely culturally diverse. There is not a single ""Anglo-American"" culture that does not exist. And many US urban areas like Chicago, LA, New York, El Paso, Miami, Atlanta etc all tend to be Moasic in nature. Chicago alone, has over 150 different spoken languages, and distinct cultures.   Just by looking at languages, in Chicago, Spanish is already heavily integrated into every day daily life. Especially in Chicago public schools, where Spanish is used on a daily, I am speaking from experience since 43% of Chicago students spoke Spanish as a native language.  The history of Illinois (the state Chicago is located in) was actually founded by the French, and Illinois has a long Roman Catholic history. Illinois still is Roman Catholic today.",4주 전(수정됨),0,

British descendants haven't been the dominant group since the 1980's.   Gen Alpha Americans are expected to be even less White than GenZ, with Gen Alpha excepted to be about 43%-45% White.   Also, the USA is a Presidential Republic, like Russia, Brazil, Mexico, the Philippines, South Korea or France. The US political system is more like other presidential republics like Brazil or Mexico, then it is to the UK, Canada or Australia 😂😂.

The Midwest was known for its vast migration from non-English speaking nations, especially Chicago and the upper Midwest.

I don’t even have to mention anything else but the nasal vowels most common in the Midwest. As far as I know, French and Portuguese are the only other 2 languages that have nasal vowels. After all, the Midwest WAS a French colony.  There are TONS of accents in the Midwest tho, a Chicagoan sounds nothing like someone from southern Illinois, Minnesota or Ohio. And someone from Detroit would sound nothing like someone from rural northern Michigan or southern Ohio. There is more accent variations in the Midwest than there is on the entire western half of the United States which is mainly just 1 whole accent.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

@FilthyAnimal893,"American southerner here, and i just have to defend the biscuits and gravy thing. Especially because that image was almost as unflattering as the bangers and mash meme. First of all, you havent lived until you've had a proper buttermilk biscuit. The recipe is widely available online and fairly simple, but we mostly just buy something thats prepared, ready to throw in the oven. Brands to look out for include pilsbury and banquet. Its very common to eat them plain with butter, or with cream cheese spread and jelly/jam, but the gravy is a tradition, and a personal favorite of mine. Its not a brown gravy, but a white gravy, or more accuratly simply french bechamel cream sauce, with added chunks of a specific type of ground sausage and seasoned only with salt and heafty amount of black pepper. Notably, the ground sausage is the most important ingredient of the dish, again we typically buy it already prepared, and it is easy to come by at any supermarket in the American southeast. Brands to look out for are Jimmy Dean, Country Crock, and Banquet, and the style is ""country breakfast sausage."" If you cant find a brand name, and wish to prepare your own, simply use ground pork seasoned with fennel, sage, crushed red pepper, brown sugar, and if course salt, pepper, onion, and only a little garlic, please dont go overboard with the garlic.  just combine the ground meat with the bechamel cream sauce, add an honestly concerning amount of black pepper, and you have a delicious country-style sausage gravy. a real gem of the Georgia-Florida-Alabama area. also we drink coffee the way brits drink tea. We drink tea too, but very differently. Its served ice cold with comical amounts of of sugar and maybe a squeeze of lemon.",2년 전,1,

See, when you do, and you are going to be a fantastic parent, you will understand why parents speak of their children so highly, even when they’re not around. I will try and explain.  I have raised two sons. Both are in their twenties now, mid, and late 20’s. One, owns his own floor laying business. The other is in the airforce. When we have children, SO MUCH can go wrong. So many bad influences and terrible decisions can make their lives miserable. But, if you raise them well, you see them grow into valuable members of society, and known as decent in their communities, you receive IMMENSE pride.  My sons are like having my heart outside of my body, and to know they’re awesome men….I can’t quite describe how happy that makes me. 🌹",2년 전(수정됨),0,

There's just something wrong there lol  I'm all for microwaving a cup of water when I want tea, but I can see the arguments on both sides. The idea is to get hot water to put in a cup with a bag of tea on both sides of the pond, but with the cup in the microwave, you're skipping the pouring step and the need for another pot that takes up space, has to be kept clean, and filled regularly (or appliance in the case of an electric kettle). Although it is more satisfying on some level to bring a kettle to a boil and pour it over the tea bag as opposed to dropping the tea bag in the cup and getting it to saturate so it doesn't just float on top. I'll make my point more concise: get me a slightly bigger kitchen and an electric kettle, and I'll talk switching sides lol",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@MGmirkin,"""In America they have those with gravy...""  Well, yes.   But we *also* cut them in half and have them with honey or jam. Biscuits are more versatile than *just* biscuits and gravy. I mean, if you've never had a fresh warm buttermilk biscuit torn in half horizontally with honey drizzled on the inside (face-up), you've never really ""lived,"" have you? ;)  American ""biscuits"" are basically British ""scones"" just without the egg & sugar. So they're more a little bit buttery / flaky / savory. But, we do also have scones,  which are typically made a bit sweeter, and tend to be more dense / dried out in bakeries, for whatever reason. Whether made wrong, or what have you? ;)  Also, don't knock biscuits & gravy until you've had it. It's actually quite savoury /delicious.  It's a white cream sauce / gravy with browned ground sausage, flour [thickener], cream, cracked  black pepper, maybe some other herbs / spices. Over a split ""buttermilk biscuit"" [basically a scone, but without egg / sugar, just flour, butter, salt, etc.]. All quite lovely.

@lookoutforchris, @MrGlenn442 a microwave does all those things faster and more efficiently than a kettle but you need the money for a microwave.  Plus the microwave cooks more things.  I honestly think the divide comes down to money.  My family had a microwave in the 1980s.  I can’t think of a house that doesn’t have one.  But they’re a couple hundred dollars compared to $12.99 for a kettle.  Europe is poorer than America across the board and they just don’t have microwave money or money for both appliances.  They often mask their lack of wealth in spiteful almost religious arguments over what is “proper.”,1개월 전,0,
@MrGlenn442," @lookoutforchris  More efficiently? Nope. The heating element is literally in the water. Resistive heat is as close to 100% efficient as something can be be. (Check technology connections - Alec did a good video on this) We have microwaves *as well*. It was not about the money, but not having a need - we mostly cooked with (natural) gas. The idea of using a 700-1000w microwave to heat water when the 2-3kw ~90-100% efficient kettle is right there seems... I don't want to say stupid, but you seem to be coming at it from a ""Micro wave is the default"" angle, when it never needed to be.

You can do them savory with addons like meats and cheese and gravy, or do them sweet with jams and honey and the like. American biscuits are just a type of bread haha. Different texture versus normal sandwich bread obviously   Cookies are the other thing!!! Sugary by default.

@kimafry," @thatoneperson9002  exactly what @HeartWyrm said. The only way an American biscuit would be sweet is to cut it in half and put jelly, jam, or honey.

I live in the South and myself, the city,  and the majority of the country actually has what is known as ""General American"" (aka, what you would hear on the evening news in most places) neutral accent which is what the one kid did really well.  2. The kettle controversy, lol. Nope, we don't have kettles. I remember as a kid, my mom had one and a few people had one, but she lived over seas for a long time, so I think it was a carry over for her, but most people microwave the water, use a Keurig, or have a water filter that dispenses hot water rather than an actual kettle.  3. Language is so funny. I had a professor from England in college and he told us the funny story of the time he was in college in the US for the first time and asked a classmate for a rubber or the shocked look on his face when a girl he was going out with told him she wasn't going to wear pants to the park because it was too hot.",2년 전,0,

Stir the hell out of it over med high heat until it starts to thicken, reintroduce sausage, a bit of salt and black pepper. Once it’s thick enough, remove from heat and serve it on a biscuit.

@qxqp," @Linus.0823  proud Englishman here but unfortunately you're wrong, the American accent is probably closer to the old English accent than today's English accent(s) is. Two ways we can tell this is 1) the American and Australian accents are similar in the sense that they are both much more 'nasal' and also have that higher pitch tone everyone does when they impersonate an American or Australian.. if you think about it, the first American and Australian settlers landed in their countries around 400 and 200 years ago (400 - American, 200 Australian) so these settlers would have both taken with them something similar to what was being used in England at the time. The fact that the Australians and Americans both speak with a nasal sound and higher pitch makes it very likely that the English used to speak with a nasal sound and higher pitch. There is no explanation as to why both these accents would develop by themselves this way unless the English accent sounded much more American/ Australian back in the day.   And another way we can tell is that before there was an official spelling for words (no dictionary) people used to write how they spoke. If we read documents written from hundreds of years ago (we can even use examples from the monarchy like queen Victoria for example) even the way she wrote suggests that she spoke much more like an American than an Englishman, with stronger pronunciation of certain letters and parts of words and less focus on others.  So yes, as annoying as it is and as little as I like to admit it, the Americans actually sound more like the old English than the actual English do. Sorry to ruin the party.",2년 전(수정됨),88,

Accents as well as dialects in former colonies have indeed hung on to things that were lost in the UK... but then those colonies added their own flavour too.  The American accents in particular are strongly influenced by high levels of immigration... and the lexicon and syntax reflect the fact that many settlers spoke Dutch or German as their mother tongue. Rhoticity came from the Celts (mostly Irish immigrants). Loan words like zucchini were taken from other groups....  There is no one place you can go where you'll hear English spoken in its 'original form'... (And what would that form be? Would it include the old Germanic 'thou' and its conjugations?)...  The fact is, however, that few British people today truly use RP. I did my thesis on the 'Queen's English', and my conclusion was that nobody actually spoke it.  There is no 'right version', but I'd suspect that the version that sounds closest to the 'old version' is actually spoken in the UK, some distance North of London but south of Edinburgh.",2년 전(수정됨),6,

The only thing an American accent has with an Australian accent is that they pronounce some words the same. U could argue that they put more emphasis on the R's like Americans, but that's not because that was what old English sounds like (as in the strong pronunciation of R like Americans have) because Australians don't put as much emphasis on it as American's, but also u do get English accents with the strong R sound as well (such as in Summerset), but if u listen to old English in films it sounds pretty much identical to Australians nowadays apart from the fact that they go up at the end.",2년 전,2,

Don't even get me started on the Welsh or Scots (Broad Scots often being punted as an older version of English) or Ulstermen (Scots Irish to the USA reader).  English is a mongeral language closest to a dutch dialect with Germanic roots sprinkled with words and phrases from Latin, french and Scandinavia but ..........it all came together on the British isle to become English.

@vintagebarbieworld9272, @adrock889  Yes you are exactly correct 👍 on that one my friend! They can spot on imitate an American accent so well because of movies and t.v. shows from America that they grew up generation after generation watching. Everyone around the world knows American movies and t.v shows really. We can’t really pull off the British accent very well because we didn’t grow up watching British entertainment save for like Benny Hill. Hollywood is iconically American and this is where the majority of cinema entertainment comes from and originated here in America.

Even beyond those days into more modern eras, for the wealthier people a restroom in a fancy restaurant for example, would be luxurious and quite large, an attendent would be there with everything from fancy soaps, clean hand towels, to light refreshments.

@크로아탐,"​ @lissandrafreljord7913  on the one hand, Korea has many similarities with France.  1. People in both countries served as a bridge to deliver culture to island country.  2. People in both countries are filled with passionate emotions with love and anger. So there's a lot of artistic temperament.  3. They are stubborn, quick-tempered, and has a lot of fighter temperament. I hear that French people are good at swearing, is it right? If that's right, it's also similar to Koreans. This may seem rude to people in other countries, but in fact they are even strict with themselves.  4. Because of that characteristic, they are good at satire and humor.  5. In the same vein, they are full of passion for knowledge and philosophy. France has many great works related to that.  South Korea has only recently begun to gain attention through parasite and squid game.  6. In South Korea, there was an Asian version of the French Revolution. When the pro-democracy movement took place in South Korea, people in the West viewed it with skepticism that it would not succeed in a family-oriented Asian culture. But eventually they won their sovereignty after a long struggle. It was the first bottom-up reform in Asia, and the West calls it ""roses grewed on a garbage"". And they still drag down a president they don't like and send him to prison lol  7. Speaking of which, I remembered that the reason why Korea was colonized by Japan was that the royalty and bureaucrats were corrupt in the late Joseon Dynasty. Even buying and selling government posts happened, so the boundaries of a status system became increasingly blurred. You can imagine, if it wasn't for Europe, the French Revolution would have happened in Korea.  8. People in both countries are full of pride in their culture, including food.  9. Just as French people have many kinds of cheese, Korea also has many kinds of kimchi, which is a fermented food. And they consider the harmony between alcohol and food.  10. Yes, this is the key. Just as the rivalry between Franch and British is famous. It is becoming increasingly known that Korean and Japanese are also rivals.    It's always interesting to see that politics and national character are closely related to geography. Of course, the situation in Korea is more complicated, so it have to combine some of the German characteristics here. It seems that Japan is the only Asian country that is perfectly similar to a particular European country.",2년 전(수정됨),4,
@bangchanswebbrowsinghistor5145," @크로아탐  As a French, first I fully agree with your assesment, also to further the French-Korean love of food, can I say that kimchi goes super well with some types fo french cheeses ?

@GreenManGrowing, @크로아탐  Lol keep taking those tests.,2년 전(수정됨),1,
@크로아탐," @GreenManGrowing  First of all, there are so many mistakes that I don't know what to point out first. But I'll do my best. 1. I can't believe China is France. To be honest, from the perspective of Koreans, I think it would have been better if it were really like that. Japan wanted to conquer China so badly, but at that time, its navigation technology was not able to fight with China at the national level. If China played the role of France, Korea would be peaceful. Surprisingly, the first national battle between China and Japan was the first Sino-Japanese War in 1894. This is in contrast to Korea's frequent battles with China since ancient times.  2. I'll just tell you the history of the invasion of Korea, China and Japan. First, the Silla and the Tang Alliance vs. the Baekje and the Yamato Alliance. Silla, which won the battle, became the first unified dynasty on the Korean Peninsula. However, seeing the decline of Silla and Tang, which exhausted many troops in this battle, Japanese quietly decided to build up its strength. Second, The ""Kamikaze Incident"" in which Mongolia and Goryeo troops expedition for Japan and failed Yeah, it's not the army, it's the tsunami that stopped it. As such, Japan's natural condition at the time was so messed up that it was difficult to move to the continent in the first place. Third. After clearing up the confusion caused by Japan's sengoku era for the first time, the Shogunate now wanted to go on an expedition to Ming. However, it was too far to invade Ming directly, so it invaded through Joseon. This was the first Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592. It hasn't been long since Japan emerged as such a great power. Of course,  Joseon and Ming troops won.  3. Now let's look at what each country's diplomatic relationship was like. Both China and South Korea called Japan Japanese pirates and treated them as barbarians. In their history, the Japanese invade, kicked out, the Japanese invade, kicked out. Even worse, King Sejong, who thought he should not just leave them, took Tsushima Island and even returned it. This is even the record of Joseon, which was close to Japan. Even Joseon's records are like this. Imagine what China's arrogant record was like... Then, the first time they felt threatened by Japan was the Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592. In this battle, the Ming army commander said to the Joseon people, ""Where did all the descendants of Goguryeo who put the Sui and Tang Dynasties in danger go? Because they fell into a swamp of learning, they called the Japanese invasion and fell into the abyss."" Right, Joseon was never a weak image. Rather, during this battle, Joseon was weaker than expected, so the Ming Dynasty was shocked. I heard that even though it was a battle that Joseon won through tactics. This stupid dynasty ignored the advice, not knowing what tragedy would come later...  4. So it doesn't make sense geographically from the beginning. It was because they could not ignore Korea and fight only between Japan and China. Joseon was just arrogant enough to concentrate on his studies without growing an army. Just because the era of peace was so long after the emergence of a ridiculous, huge unified dynasty in China. It's just... I don't think the current world situation is any different.  5. What do you mean cabbage diet? At least I've never heard of it. The food culture in Korea is different from region to region. I'm sure it's true in any country. Tofu and pepper... I've never even heard of such a dish. They don't eat cabbage, uncooked tofu that often in the first place. Are you sure you live in Korea? And a segmented stainless steel tray is the same in China. They don't even use it unless it's school meals, military meals. To be honest, it's interesting to me that the tombs resemble each other.  6. Nationalitic... Look, it's been less than a hundred years since they escape the colony. Even the victims are alive. It wasn't a long time ago when they were strongly pursuing independence. However, even that has disappeared a lot now that it has recovered its national power. And Koreans don't want to be French. The fact that the French will be shocked because the Paris Baguette bread is not delicious is also used as a humor material in South Korea lol Rather, do you know a disease called Paris Syndrome of Japan?",2년 전(수정됨),1,

@Pr0fessorScience,"Scones vs biscuits from an American who bakes, to settle it. TL;DR: scones and biscuits aren't the same and Americans would find it weird to put gravy on a scone, too.  British scone, per Mary Berry: mostly cold cubed butter with a little milk and some sugar, cut the butter into the flour to produce a pebble texture.  This produces small pockets of butter in the dough, which creates a moist crumble texture.  Most Americans would immediately recognize this as a ""shortcake"" if you stuffed it with whipped cream and fresh strawberries instead of clotted cream and jam, so we do have/make them here.  ""Traditional"" U.S. scone: no butter whatsoever.  All fat and moisture comes from heavy/whipping cream.  More sugar than a British scone.  The lack of butter produces a very dry crumble.  10/10 do not recommend.  Traditional ""flaky"" U.S. biscuit: cold grated butter and buttermilk, almost no sugar.  Cut the butter into the flour to produce a fine pebble texture, then roll the dough out, fold onto itself, roll again, etc, like making puff pastry.  This produces thin sheets of butter in between the dough that cause the finished product to flake/peel apart, kind of like a croissant but more dense.  Not noticeably sweet.  Modified ""tender"" U.S. biscuit: a British scone but more milk and almost no sugar.  Similar texture to a British scone but generally more moist and not noticeably sweet.  Probably a large contributor to the confusion between British scones and American biscuits.",2년 전,1,

@briannicholas2757,"You guys are really privileged to get to interact with those young men. If you can get past the look, Biscuits and Gravy is one of the tastiest things you'll ever eat.  When I was at Military Academy and in the Army, we had a breakfast item called S.O.S., which was typical military three letter abbreviation for Shit on a Shingle. Basically it is traditionally made with chipped  beef or hamburger, mixed with a traditional milk based country cream gravy, and served over toast (that's the shingle).  My father, who served during the Korean War period, was served the same thing. It is a staple in military ""cuisine"", and each new generation of soldiers discovers it.  It genuinely tastes great, and both my dad and I still make it about once a month . A very basic recipe for you lads to try at home: Ingredients 1 pound of ground beef, preferably ground chuck, and preferably with an 80% to 20% meat to fat ratio. 1 pound ground pork (optional, but it does add good flavor) 1 small to medium onion, finely diced To cloves of garlic, finely minced, or use garlic powder (not garlic salt). Course ground black pepper Salt to taste 4 to 6  heaping table spoons of all purpose flour 2 to 3 cups of whole milk (warmed in the microwave)  Optional add one can of evaporated milk (canned)  Dice your onion. In a large pot, on medium heat, crumble your ground beef and pork, and add the onion, garlic and pepper, and cook completely.  Then add the flour and stir. ( this absorbs the cooked fat and basically creates what is called a roux in culinary terms. It is,also what thicken your milk gravy. Reduce the heat to low medium, and Add the warmed milk and the can of evaporated milk, stirring frequently to prevent scorching and until the country gravy thickens ( it should basically coat a spoon like a bechemel sauce) Add salt to taste Serve over well done toast, or you can use other options like a biscuit or in England a plain scone.  it is also excellent served over  crispy French fries (chips), it creates a real contrast with the crispy fries and creamy gravy. It is reminiscent of the Canadian French fry dish called Poutine. I call it Army poutine.  Anyway, give it a try, and let the boys at your school try it. I'm pretty sure there will be some converts. I'm betting the twins will enjoy it as well. Bon Apetit",2년 전,2,

Breakfast gravy is a white gravy made with flour and milk or cream with cracked pepper and salt and sometimes cayenne or crumbles of sausage.  You get this creamy warm gravy and savory biscuit taste that pairs well with some scrambled eggs and crispy bacon(yes, I cannot eat undercooked rubbery bacon...lol). And wash it down with fresh OJ.

The US biscuits would probably work well with the British breakfast beans, too, instead of toast.

I mean, even their bread is so loaded with sugar that it is not legally allowed to be sold as bread here in the EU, they'd have to classify it as cake...  Basically, the dish in the picture will keep you going, even if you have a tough physical job. All an American breakfast will do for you, is give you diabetes and heart disease.

@bobbiejojackson9448,"Excellent suggestion, but...  Whoever made the dish for them would have to go to ""YouTube University"" and watch several videos regarding how to make ""Authentic Southern Biscuits and Sausage Gravy"" first.  They'd also need to learn the difference between a typical British sausage and American breakfast sausage, because the two taste fairly different. The seasonings used in something like a Jimmy Dean bulk country sausage are very specific and they're what give the gravy it's distinctive ""savory but not spicy"" deliciousness! 😘😍  I've seen a few channels from outside the US attempt to make the dish, using what they consider to be sausage and a then paired it with a ""sweet"" biscuit recipe, like the type used for berry shortcake and cobbler... and let's just say that it's been a disaster every time.  😂 Peeling the casing off a traditional bratwurst or British ""banger"" and dicing it into little cubes does not give the desired result. HaHa  I've also seen recipes on YouTube for homemade American bulk breakfast sausage, which is imperative to the dish and not too difficult to make, if you have the meat grinder attachment for your KitchenAid mixer or you have a local butcher that you have a great relationship with who'll follow the process to the letter. I'm not sure if all countries have fresh ground pork shoulder in their grocery store butcher/meat department, but it must have no seasoning in it, other than maybe a bit of salt that was added in the processing.  All that to ultimately say, true Southern Biscuits and Sausage Gravy must be made with the traditional American ingredients if one wants to experience the ”real deal"". This is not the type of dish where substitutions in the ingredients or preparation are a good idea.  But... if done correctly, I'm convinced that the guys would absolutely love it! 😊",2년 전,5,
@FilthyAnimal893," @bobbiejojackson9448  my fathers and grandfathers cousins in the Carolinas used to make this sausage before it became commercial. As with any sausage making process, grinding the right cuts of meat is important because the fat ratios matter, but the seasoning is fairly simple. Fennel, Sage, Crushed red pepper, and the onion garlic salt and pepper. all the seasoning ratios are always to taste, ive heard stories of making a ""taster"" sausage first to make sure the seasonings are right before grinding the rest of the hog, but the best kept secret is the best cuts to throw in the grinder for the perfect fat ratio. Thats always the tricky part. My grandad actually lost a finger to a meat grinder.",2년 전(수정됨),1,

I guess that's why I get so persnickety when I see someone try to make a classic dish with what seems to be all the wrong ingredients. 😆   You're absolutely right that the cuts of pork are very important (especially the fat to lean ratio) but the main issue with what these lads were given, was that it sounds very much like they used traditional British style sausage and scones to replicate what's meant to be a savory dish.   Sausage in the UK is often made with spices like nutmeg, ginger, cloves, mace etc. and it tends to be more of a sweet spiciness than a savory one. Then, from what they all said, it sounds like they used scones instead of real buttermilk biscuits and scones are more of a sweet pastry as well!

It's faster to use what you've got, whether that's a microwave or stove, than buy an extra appliance to have to find room for as most of us have too much to begin with. PS, the most common experiment was to use 2 identical plants in the same soil, different pots and given the exact same amounts of water.  This experiment has been repeated many times with the same result.  One plant received water boiled in a microwave and cooled, the other plant received water boiled on a stove and cooled.

You are more likely to see them around a breakfast sandwich, or as the bread side for various meals.

Soda breads (& corn bread which is levened with baking soda or baking powder, but is not a soda bread in the usual sense) can bake quicker, and versions of them can even be made over a stove or camp fire.

Canadian back bacon is similar to UK bacon (neither of which we get in the US). Canadian bacon in the US is basically ham in disguise.

@zilesis1," @brianking768  but a kettle is useful for so many other things besides tea. any instant drink requiring hot water can use a kettle: cocoa, hot chocolate, instant coffee, even regular coffee if you like having a cafetiere. and unlike a microwave, you can make several drinks at once since a kettle holds about 5 cups then there's instant ramen, instant porridge etc. you can significantly speed up cooking time for stuff like pasta, since a kettle is faster than a pot on the stove. instead of waiting for you water to boil before adding pasta you just biol the kettle, then pur the boiling water on your pasta and turn on the heat. saves a couple mminutes of wating that way so... yeah, a kettle is pretty useful even if you don't drink tea, so it's pretty odd when people don't have one",2년 전,6,
@brianking768," @zilesis1  I’m not saying I disagree with you about a Kettle’s usefulness. But the only use you mentioned that might make Americans adopt a kettle was pre boiling water to add to a pot for pasta. The other things you mentioned, we don’t do it that way. Coffee is made in a coffee maker. Sure some hipsters might make pour over coffee or use a French press and that minority like US tea drinkers probably has a kettle. Cocoa - please tell me that y’all use milk and not water (I know the packets say you can use water, but we all know that’s a lie). Instant coffee strikes us like instant powdered reconstituted tea would sound to you - gross. Ramen, etc., is made in the microwave just like our instructions say. Heating a cup of water in a microwave or kettle takes about the same amount of time (it all depends on the wattage of each appliance). Our electric standards are different than yours and our kettles work slightly slower as a result. Before microwaves, most American household had a stovetop kettle. Now those are mostly gone. American tea drinkers (and pour over coffee folks) have kettles; nobody else does. That’s not likely to change. I love that these little cultural differences still exist. Finding out the “why” is cool.",2년 전,4,
@zilesis1," @brianking768  hmmm, base on what you're saying there seems to be a chicken and egg situation going on. a lot of things here are designed for a kettle. e.g. over here ramen, porridge etc have a kettle on the instructions. some have microwave, but many just have 1. put in bowl 2. pour hot water from kettle 3. stir and leave to stand for 2 min 4. eat and a lot of instant drinks already come with milk powder in them, so they just need hot water and nothing else so i wonder if the mass-adoption of the kettle made manufacturers change the products to better suit a kettle? or did the manufactureres all decide to make stuff for kettles and the people adopted by buying kettles?",2년 전,1,
@brianking768," @zilesis1  I think people in tea drinking cultures, like the UK, bought electric kettles because they were so useful in making tea. Once you had the kettle, you saw how convenient it was for boiling water and adapted it for other things. If you remember, my first comment was: WE DON’T DRINK TEA. No initial need for the kettle. I don’t know - but am interested - how widespread microwaves are in the UK. Everyone in the US has one. In most homes or apartments, they’re built into the kitchen. Similarly, almost everyone has a coffee maker too. If you come to the US, your hotel room will NOT have a kettle but will have a coffee maker.

I Think the problem arises when people expect them to be the same item  and they are not. Even a NZ scone and a UK scone are slightly different. I have noticed in American biscuit recipes that they seem have a higher fat ratio whereas scones have a higher liquid content. Also scones here lend themselves to a greater variety - Sultana Scones, Cheese Scones, Date Scones etc...

@heruhcanedean," @nzmoggy3898  Scones compared to American biscuits are drier and denser. You wouldn't call a croissant wet but they aren't as dry as a scone. Scones have more of a crumb to them too, biscuits are more flaky. With a mixing time of about 30-40 seconds I don't think I'm over working the scone dough. I think you've just never had one and are trying to imagine what they are.  A loaf of bread has the same texture as a scone right? They use pretty much the same ingredients and they are both baked, they must be the same.",2년 전,2,
@kaseyc9459," @nzmoggy3898  ooh your scones sound yummy.  Scones in the US are made with egg, while our biscuits usually are not.  That may explain why US scones are more dense and crumbly as opposed to light, moist and fluffy like our biscuits.  I must admit, I prolly never tried a proper scone (UK style) cause most I've tried are much drier than American biscuits.  A UK scone may be much closer to an American biscuit than a US scone.  I wish you could mail me some of yours. Lol I disagree that scones lend for higher variety, though.

Typically gravy here is either brown or white.  When people say biscuits and gravy they usually mean white sausage gravy,  but some people use brown gravy.  Some people put honey, butter or jam on them.  It's basically whatever you want.",2년 전,2,
@AllWIllFall2Me," @thatgirl9532  So, to clear up a small thing here: for most Americans, if you said ""Gravy"" without added context, they would imagine a brown gravy, as one would 'normally' have with a roast dinner, mashed potatoes, or other dinner dishes.   However, ""biscuits and gravy"" is typically a breakfast food, and it uses a sausage/cream-based gravy, (often called ""country gravy"") that originally arose out of a (somewhat contradictory) sense of frugality and decadence: see,  sausage is a pretty traditional American breakfast staple, so what you'd do is fry sausage, and then make a simple gravy in the left-over fat. If you had the money/resources, you would add additional protein or fat by adding milk or cream to the gravy. And if you were particularly well off, you'd have extra sausage to leave in the gravy, to add even MORE fat/protein.  Over time, cattle and milk production in America made milk very easily accessible, so everyone who grew up only getting the milk-enriched gravy sometimes could now do it ALL the time, and it became the de-facto version for specifically breakfast meals that could use gravy, like biscuits (where the added gravy lets you hide if they're a little dry), or a dish like Chicken-fried steak (a pounded and breaded beefsteak, fried, and served sauced with the gravy)  For a similar culinary progression, you can look at Spaghetti and Meatballs: Italian immigrants to America discovered beef was vastly cheaper here, and, to treat themselves, combined spaghetti in meat sauce with meatballs, forming a new, doubly meaty dish.",2년 전,1,
@nzmoggy3898," @heruhcanedean  Um Croissants are a lightly, airy, buttery, flaky pastry where as scones are a quick bread. Yes they have similar ingredients but that is as far as the comparison goes.  I don't have to imagine what a scone tastes like as I have been making them for over 50 years. My reference to over working was to scone dough, if you over work the dough it can become, dense, dry and fails to rise.",2년 전,0,
@heruhcanedean," @nzmoggy3898  Imagine trying to claim 50 years of ""baking"" experience as an excuse to not knowing the difference of breads, I don't have to imagine because I can make both UK and US style biscuits with only about 5 years experience. I starting learning baking by making German biscuits, which are very different than UK and US. Try making American style breakfast biscuits sometime, the 50 years of scone making might help.

@melissak3885," @Ishlacorrin  Not sure where you’re getting your information from.  The acidity of buttermilk reacts with baking soda, which is a base, to create more, not less, rise than with a less acidic liquid such as milk.  Plus the acidity tends to break down gluten and other proteins in flour.  The overall effect is a baked good that rises higher and is softer than using regular milk or cream.  While it’s true that buttermilk’s acidity would interfere with the leavening effect of yeast, a buttermilk biscuit would never use yeast as a leavening agent.

Buttermilk when substituted for regular milk always produces a denser product, you have to adjust for that when cooking.

@charliedavis8894," @Ishlacorrin  Your basic 3 ingredient ""biscuit"" is called shortbread in America, and is considered a hard cookie, not a biscuit.  An American biscuit uses your 3 ingredients as a base but is not the entire recipe.  While there are 3 ingredient American biscuits, those recipes use self-rising flour which has the baking powder in it.  Baking powder has been used in American biscuits since it was invented in 1846, before that, a combination of cream of tartar and baking soda was used and if those weren't available Americans have used potash since the early 1700s.    MelissaAK is correct, American buttermilk biscuits always have a leavening agent and are light, fluffy or flaky and delicious.  They can be eaten plain, with butter and jam, with sausage gravy or stuffed with egg, cheese and sausage, ham or bacon as a breakfast sandwich. Your basic 3 ingredients are not just the basic ingredients in biscuits but also the basic ingredients in white sauce, better known in Europe as bechamel sauce.  White sauce is the basic ingredient in the gravy for biscuits and gravy but sausage and seasonings are added and sometimes sausage or bacon fat is used instead of butter.  What the British call a biscuit isn't the same as an American biscuit (buttermilk or milk), neither are the 2 countries scones or cookies the same things.",2년 전(수정됨),8,

@charliedavis8894," @Ishlacorrin  Your point about buttermilk combined with baking powder or soda making a baked product denser is wrong.   Even the website BBCgoodfood disagrees with you along with many other professional cooking sites and cookbooks. I quote the site I mentioned; ""There are two types of buttermilk. Traditional buttermilk is a thin, cloudy, slightly tart but buttery-tasting liquid that's left after cream is churned to make butter. These days, however, it is more commonly sold as a thick liquid produced commercially by adding an acidifying bacteria – and sometimes flavouring and thickening agents – to milk. This commercial product can be thought of as a gentler, thinner yogurt, with any buttery flavour likely added.  Buttermilk is traditionally a drink, but is more often used in baking now. When used with baking soda, it reacts to form carbon dioxide, thus helping mixtures such as soda bread, rolls, scones and waffles to rise.""  It is the acid in buttermilk combined with baking powder or soda that produces the rise in a baked good.  Have you never combined vinegar with baking soda as a science experiment in school?  That's basic food science.  Or, added a tablespoon of vinegar to a cup of milk to make your own buttermilk? Perhaps it's time to call out your cooking instructor for giving you incorrect information or for having you use buttermilk without baking powder or soda.  Lastly, I just want to address your repeated attempts at insulting America.  While YOU may think America is a joke, there are millions of people willing to risk everything, including their very lives, to come here for the freedom and opportunity America offers.  Sharing knowledge of the differences between countries and cultures is always better than flinging insults.  No country is immune to their particular problems, including yours.",2년 전(수정됨),7,

My factual statements still stand, about baking AND the USA. I was not insulting the country or it's people, I was stating objective facts.

Perhaps you should reread my comments more carefully.   And no, you haven't made any factual statement about either baking OR the USA.  You insulted the school system and a poster, you insulted the country as a whole and it's people by saying you ""pity"" us and you called the country a joke.

And, if only 3rd world people are coming here then quickly returning explain why so many of them AND brits, Europeans and Australians move here to stay.  The real fact about America is that without us, the UK and most of Eastern and Western Europe would be speaking German today.  When you insist that you're right, despite all evidence to the contrary, it's not a good look for you, especially when millions of professional bakers disagree with you.

You also missed the point completely, Baking with buttermilk rises less than baking with milk unless you add additional raising agent. That fact remains the same. Thinking anyone is jealous of the US is typical US arrogance and another reason you are a joke to the rest of the world.  Brits, Europeans and Australians only need a year or two to decide they were better off where they started.   The US migrant population is made up from: Non-Mexico Latin America 28.0%, Mexico 24.8%, East Asia (mostly China) 16.6%, Europe (including UK) 9.5%, Indian Subcontinent 8.8%, Sub-Saharan Africa 5.5%, Middle East 4.2%, Canada 1.7%, Oceania/Elsewhere 0.9%.   That means at LEAST 89.6% are from places other than you mentioned (the Australian figure is rolled into the miscellaneous number so we can;t be certain how much of that 0.9% it is).  In the last 21 months (Jan 2021-Sept 2022) the primary migrant populations have been from: Non-Mexico Latin America 60%, Sub-Saharan Africa 12%, Indian Subcontinent 9%.

Congratulations!  You've also presented yourself as a brit so if you're not, you must be ashamed of the country you're from, I'm not.  American biscuits are not made with buttermilk and no baking powder so your claims are invalid for those.  Not only that, but nowhere do you differentiate between US legal vs. illegal immigration which have vastly different numbers.   Mexican migration, both legal and illegal, has declined sharply in the past decade.  Today, America has immigration from 131 different countries, both legal and illegal.   Many green card holders come here to work part of the year and go back home, thats what a green card is for.  Others come both legally and illegally and most who come legally stay here and get citizenship.

As for the biscuits you could probably find some cans of “American” biscuits, not as good as homemade obviously but it works fine.  If you wanted to make it yourself, the biscuits and the gravy are the easy part.

@soilabelle," @Todez_YT  Jesus Christ is Real. I don't know what you went through to make you think that way...  But try to ask Him (Jesus Christ) to open your heart, eyes, and ears - so that you can see Him and know He does exist.   “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6)",2년 전,4,

@soilabelle," @Todez_YT  If you need a solid evidence, then read the Bible. Everything's written there.  But before you read it, pray that you'll  have discerning so you'll understand everything you're going to read.  And ask God to come into Your life, that way You'll get to know Him more. But it doesn't happen overnight (for some, well at least to me). You have to constantly pray to Him, to want to know more about Him...   Lastly, I'm not forcing you to believe me. You need to find out for yourself whether what I say is true or not. And the first thing you need to do is to open your heart to God.",2년 전,3,
@Todez_YT, @soilabelle  so you think because someone wrote a book claiming things happened it's true? You are really gullible,2년 전,2,
@soilabelle," @Todez_YT  And you are funny! 🤣  But I understand you because I was in the same situation before where I was skeptical whether God and Jesus Christ were real or not even though I grew up in a Christian family. And we have Bibles at home. (Fun fact: The Bible was written by human, but the knowledge, words, and visions came from God.)  But I really wanted to know Him - to not have doubts whether He does exist or not. There were times where I tried to talk to Him in my mind like ""please Lord God, show me that You exists"" - so maybe that's why one day He made a way (an unpaved way - I say this because I had to experience pain, but I sincerely hope it doesn't happen to anyone who wants to know Him better, so people have to pray for that as well so they don't suffer so much though suffering is part of our existence, but when we suffer it should be something we can handle, right?)   Ending: I finally found Him at the end of the unpaved road. 🎆 And now I hope to walk a flowery path. There might be bumps and mishaps along the way, but I know I can carry on because of my faith in Him. Through Him, there's peace in my mind.  Anyway, I don't consider myself yet as an adult Christian because it's just recently that I really got to know Him, so if you're looking for a detailed explanation/proof, the Bible is the answer. There are also a lot of videos online proving God and His Son do exist. You might want to look for Billy Graham. But then again, the very first thing we need to do is to accept Jesus Christ in our life, and He will show us the right way.",2년 전,3,
