The amount of bacteria on shopping cart handles and escalators is crazy and it puts many consumers at risk when doing their regular everyday shopping. Check out Goldenwebstore.com when shopping for home. They have this amazing same-day and one-day shipping and the best prices on the market. They’re also partnered with Amazon and have pretty much any home product you could think of. If we all make changes like this together, eventually we can have a virus free society and live long and healthy lives for many generations to come",5년 전,0,

@CornPopWazABadDude," @stealthiscool  ohh. So this is a true story. I used to live in a condo building in downtown Orlando and a lot of the one year deal magic players used to live there way up on the top level penthouse suites. So I'd see them in the elevators every now and then and I swear on my life when I saw Ryan Anderson, JJ Reddick and Big Baby Davis they were the most skinny twig looking dudes I've ever seen. Tall AF obviously, but I alway thought they looked kind of big on TV. Especially Big Baby.  Was not the case... They were both twig skinny. Which had me wondering, if those guys look big on the court next to alot of the other guys, does that mean that almost all NBA players are that way?  Has to be, right? Although I'm sure guys like Shaq, Lebron and Dwight Howard are probably pretty jacked/big in real life, but these guys I met were not at all.  For context I'm about 6' even and hover around 220 LBS. So I'm maybe a little bigger than average for my height, but I'm telling yall these guys were so skinny.",4년 전,0,

That's cool 2013: Fun fact- Scotland opted to make the unicorn its national animal. 2014: Also a fun fact, the patent for fire hydrants was officially lost in a fire 2015: If you couldn't tell, YouTube still had this video dead. 2016: Also, this year and beyond mark a trend of awful rewinds. 2017: Fortnite exists now.

@Instaguram,LeBron is arguably better but Dwight is definitely not better than Shaq.  Shaq is one of the best centers of all-time and he was the indisputable best player of the Lakers when they won three championships in the early 2000s.  Dwight doesn't even come close in terms of ability or achievement.  Why even comment when you clearly don't know what you are talking about?

@3omberMan,he's saying Lebron is being pressured by critics and can't have fun. what i said is every superstar at some point in their careers face scrutiny and it's up to them to overcome those obstacles and that's where my Kobe 'argument' comes into play. but you're right about the two things listed not being forms of criticism but they are big forms of adversity that weigh down on a player as heavily as criticism.,13년 전,0,
@insongh1996,"he's just saying that lebron used to have more fun with the game of basketball. hes not saying anything about lebron being the only criticized athlete. also saying kobe was ""robbed"" of a couple mvps and that he played with kwame brown  and smush parker are no forms of criticism, so i dont understand why you put that in your argument.",13년 전,0,
