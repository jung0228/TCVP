@personal.YouTube.channel,Considering that technically in most areas. In order to drive something with air brakes. You need a commercial CBL driver's license to be legal. Which also means you have to get a medical card to prove that your health is good enough to maintain a vehicle of that size.    OTHERWISE IN MOST AREAS YOU ARE DRIVING ILLEGALLY !,6개월 전,0,

@cziegle3794,"My mom drives a school bus as her job, and once when she was pulling into her old bus lot, she FELL OUT OF HER SEAT while coming around the corner. She just had a streak of bad luck, and during this incident, she went into the grass, and the grass is a hill, so she fell out of her seat. She was bruised up, but not seriously injured, thank God. But, given that knowledge, plus this video, plus the fact that I only just got my learner's permit a few years ago and driving a regular vehicle is still something I'm getting used to - like i only now can stop being SO TENSE when I'm passing a tractor trailer or another huge vehicle. Doesn't help that, when I was still newer at driving, I had an encounter with a jerk who tailgated me while my mom was in the passenger seat talking to me, and when I pulled over by this cluster of mailboxes, this jerk in the dark colored pickup truck drove past me, and the passenger YELLED out the window ""learn how to drive, dumba**"", which, because i cry a lot, I, in tears, completely overwhelmed, switched with mom. So, yeah, driving isn't easy, probably never will be, and i definitely don't need the added pressure of a bus or any other large vehicle. So, for me, i will only ever drive a normal vehicle. Never a bus or any large vehicle. Maybe a really short bus would be fine, but yeah, no",6개월 전(수정됨),6,

@randomone649,"22:46 , the bus, because u basically can make even 2 small bedrooms inside, you have a lot of space in it, and under the floor a lot of space for pipes and all that you need, but I would prefer on top to have solar panels to use electricity from the sun, and a pack for batteries for the night, so you can live mostly like in a house without thinking how much u waste of the electricity and water , if u make the interior in the bus as compact as u can (like it was with the van) you can have even different rooms and more stuff",3년 전,0,

I'm also to young to drive a bus privately (I'm only 21, I'd have to be 24 if I don't do it as my job).

@hannahm7179,"So not sure on whether there's a  loop hole in the bus being converted to a camper, but typically you are required to have a CDL to drive them. On top of that you state CDL doesn't necessarily allow you to drive a bus in other states, there's a special CDL for that.  Just thought I'd put that here incase someone is on the fence about getting a Van/RV or a Bus, getting a CDL isn't too hard to do but that might be a deciding factor for some",3년 전,1,

I bought this bus 7 yrs ago and it was supposed to be done in 2 yrs, however life got in the way, and we are looking at moving back up to Oregon from the So-Cal area, so fuel consumption wasn't even considered beyond what it would cost us to move there.

@adamguymon7096,What I see is that it would be nice to have solar in addition to the rooftop deck on the bus? I would as well take some of the deck off not much but a little bit so the solar could be more productive? The other thing is that I would make the hatch bigger above the bed so you can have a skylight? If it was me I would design it so you could have a screen that would slide to close off the skylight then a clear piece of glass that can slide and then a solid nontranslucent cover that would slide to close the skylight? This way you could in the summer open it up and only have the screen to keep the bugs out but allow air to come in and still see the stars while falling asleep? The clear glass would allow you to see the stars whole falling asleep in the winter but you won't freeze? The nontranslucent cover so when you do want it dark and don't want the sun in the bus you can close all light from outside out? On both the bus and ban I would have a generator installed as a bonus?,4년 전,0,

@GlobetrotterGranny,"Having been a school bus driver for a number of years, buses do not intimidate me. They are less flexible, so it is really going to come down to exactly how someone wants to travel—slow and easy, faster and more rugged terrain. Style of travel and how much you want your home with you really is going to be a big question to answer. Me? I would probably go for the bus unless I could have an oversized van.",4년 전,0,

@Boulderman,"Answer to what I would choose? Sorry but I did not feel like going through 162 plus replies to add my own reply. As a professional thirty five year long transit bus operator I would definitly choose van. This is why: 1. you really need to be professionally trained to drive a bus from how to make turns to you name it. The bigger the vehicle the tougher to drive. 2. The cost of fuel to maintenance will kill you. 3. The vehicle insurnace you have to have will kill you. 4. Like you already found out, finding a place to park is a bit challenging. 3. You can not make a U turn with a forty foot bus. So it's super easy to find yourself in a very bad place. There are many more but you get my drift. Stick with the van.",4년 전,0,

Well, as a big guy....and someone who's driven longer vehicles like that before, gotta say I'd go with the bus, but it would have to be an ""up to date"" engine/transmission, meaning within 10 years old.  My guess is that bus powertrain is older than that.  I don't want to play old diesel mechanic, and a newer powertrain means you can probably find someone or a shop to fix it.  So I vote the bus, as long as it has a newer Cummins diesel.  Why Cummins?  Cause they make great engines, and I used to work there. Oh yeah, LOVE that shower!!",4년 전,0,

But I couldn't really drive it, could not get the hang of shifting and so all the driving fell on my husband where I could totally drive a van.  But it broke my heart when a wheel flew off a semi, struck us and totaled the bus.  The bus saved our lives, if we were in anything smaller, we'd likely be dead.

I was moving a pole they had for an outside tent and pushed it right though the canvas and in my surprise to the noise i turned and made it even worse. I ended up telling them, but only after I had the canvas replaced.

It's not required for driving a bus, converted bus, or RV for non-commercial personnel use.
