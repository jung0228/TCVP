@twilightflux07,"Pokimane used to play League. In fact, look at her channel and you'll see she has the most vids of League of Legends, like around 250 vids while Fortnite has like around 110+ vids. I guess the reasons she kinda quit were because of people calling her weak, being carried by pro people, being bashed, or cause her Fortnite vids had more views than League. Plus League is such a hassle to play than other games, I view her as more of a pro when playing fps games rather than moba games.   As for t1, it depends on the context. t1 can mean Tyler1 (a famous streamer on Twitch), or SK Telecomm 1, a LoL team. Just cause LoL has t1 doesn't mean that other games can't have that team name. It's probably just another branch of t1 that you're talking about in PUBG.

You have to invest time. Also claiming someone is better than her by showing no evidence that they actually are is just stupid. I'm not defending her just saying some obvious things.

Or even youtubers, I mean, the person who taught me the game and taught me how to play is my best friend, and she is a woman clearly. But man, it's stressful to see how he complains about everything. If someone knows a streamer or youtuber who does not have this behavior please let me know, because I really can not find it (Speak Spanish or English, it does not matter) my intention is not to offend the girl in a bad way, my intention more than anything apart from seeing if someone knows some youtuber with a certain level in the game (that their videos are in a certain way didactics) is to give my opinion on this topic, that bothers me the truth and that although I am not very fond of criticizing or Even to give my opinion, is something I've been seeing since season 6.

@WrathofDash,"It's funny that you indirectly call me a baby, but you're the one who's sitting on his girlfriend's lap.  I mean, sounds like you're the child in this situation.  You have proven yourself unable to understand sarcasm.  You sit in your alleged girlfriend's lap.  You keep talking yourself up like somebody is going to care.  You're wasting your own time in this conversation.  Either your first language something other than English, or you are nothing but a leech on your girlfriend or society.  Your grammar is severely lacking, and if you expect me to think you're smarter than me, you better come up with some sentences that make sense.  Also, don't worry, if you feel like it's a Bronze wasting your time, it's not.  I'm Silver II as I mentioned to my friend earlier in this conversation.  You have anecdotes, and if that's really what your friends say, good for you.  I'm just saying that nobody cares.  You sound like a Yasuo main stuck at Bronze V that doesn't think he ever does anything wrong but gives up if he dies once.  Now if you'll excuse me, I need to prepare my child's things for tomorrow.  I feel so bad for you.  You'll never know what it's like to experience the birth of your own child since I'm assuming if you really do have a girlfriend that you sit by the side of her bed watching another man pleasure her.

@WrathofDash,"And no.  Sorry.  Multi-string should have been multi-finger tapping, as in tapping at a faster pace using multiple fingers.  Look, I'm not saying I'm better than you.  For all I know, you may be far better than I am at everything except for the trumpet.  My point is that the whole, ""Why don't you try to play a real instrument"" argument doesn't apply to me.  I'm know more than just the basics on many musical instruments, and am at least at an intermediate if not advanced level on a lot of them.  I would say with guitar, I'm an intermediate-level player, but I do know how to play and do more than just strum chords and play scales.

But League is a team game and I don't think his team in this game have the same level of play of the players he usually play with. Less vision which is very important and a lot of thing that are not well done (with the point of view of a challenger player) at least he won the game so it's good. ^^  The individual skills is more important in fps than in League so it's easier to have a good level even if you play for fun (because you will still have skills)",7년 전,64,

If you want to talk mathematically, then look on google and do some research and find the formula to calculate the delay then talk in here.

I respect that you take league as a fun game but seriously don't talk and especially insult when you don't even know that much about the game. Like you are even urging her to 1v1 you what clearly shows how little you know about the game. League is not about 1v1. You can't climb with mechanics only which is the most important thing in a 1v1. She might be a support main but there are some other huge factors in order to improve. Game knowledge, map awareness and attitude. Her attitude is great whereas you seem to be really toxic. Don't know about the rest, just tryin to imply that 1v1s don't mean shit. I don't know much about her but judging her rank and calling her boosted by her mechanics only is pretty low. Well, you can either complain about her with actual facts and knowledge about the game which you can only achieve by dedicating lots of hours into  it or enjoy the game like you're doing right now and shut your big mouth hidden in anonymity insulting her with clearly no good argumentation. I'm a trashy d5 player but I definitely do have more knowledge about league, I'm down for an argument as long as you can bring some ACTUAL arguments.",7년 전,0,

@jk-2053,"On the off chance that someone does read this, let me inform a few of y'all on some things: 1. Yes, chances are that is actually Faker. He has multiple accounts like Hide in brush (Korean), Koearn (EU), and frake (NA). 2. ... I don't have a two... Uh... Y'know, now's a good time for moral lessons😅! Look, haters gonna hate, cool, but for those willing to listen, please don't trash talk someone for being bad, especially if they're trying. Reason: Unless you're sadistic and get off on that kind of stuff, it really doesn't accomplish anything for either parties involved as you gain nothing and people learn better from positive reinforcement than negative reinforcement (feel free to do a bit of psych. research there). Now if you do enjoy that, note that other people exist on the other side that don't enjoy that stuff, so either hold it back or ignore my advice because I know people never listen to stupidly long lectures in comment sections...

If you go by the logic of someone being better just becoz they are on a higher ladder than the other players, especially when they get there from scratch multiple times, the win goes to Dopa. But if you wanna use a superficial argument of someone being better becoz a player, Faker, compete in a competition; you are either naive or stupid. Not all great players go to tournament and compete in them. Dont commit a fallacy while making yourself sounded pretty ignorant here.

If you go by the logic of someone being better just becoz they are on a higher ladder than the other players, especially when they get there from scratch multiple times, the win goes to Dopa. But if you wanna use a superficial argument of someone being better becoz a player, Faker, compete in a competition; you are either naive or stupid. Not all great players go to tournament and compete in them. Dont commit a fallacy while making yourself sounded pretty ignorant here. Research about the players abit b4 talking like a dumbass, and im talking about u assuming that dopa just plays very few champion right now. And imo, there is no best player. But there is best players.",7년 전,1,

Comparing him to ""diamonds+"" is absolutely fucking ridiculous. Saying that you could be on his level is completely disregarding the amount of effort he's put into making himself the best, as well as the immense amount of physical ability he possesses. Do not make light of him. Even the best still lose sometimes. It's ridiculous to say just because he's the best means he should win every game. ""Oh, he lost at worlds"" DOES NOT undermine is ability as a player. I actually can't believe this thread. Faker is known as the best for a reason. Nobody has his versatility and overall consistency. Don't talk shit about him just because he's the best.  There is a major difference between arrogance and confidence. He is not arrogant.

@sdrawkcab7199,You focus too much of him being the best. His point was that faker's abilities are way exaggerated which I particularly don't agree with if you see his outplays but ya!,7년 전,0,
@isaiahbarnwell1775,"@delivermypain  What do you say to the fact that Faker has been the most acclaimed pro player by other pro players and coaches throughout LOL history. You're in total disagreement with all the pros & coaches who have spent thousands of hours practicing and studying the game. Plenty of arrogant highly skilled pro players have had no problems acknowledging faker's exceptional talent. In his prime, pro players have tried pretty hard to convince people that faker's talents are really above the cut. Calling faker a god actually originated  It's a very common and agreed upon experience to not be able to notice what makes higher elo players better. If you ask any high elo player, 99% chance they'll say they didn't notice LCS players were better than them when they started playing, but realized as they got better. It's something I observed in going from unranked to diamond. Why do you think you're immune to this phenomena?   It's hard to judge skill in LOL. The micro game is actually very sensitive. By playing for a really long time you build intuitions about how to move relative to your opponent and tend to maintain a certain healthy distance. Bronze players haven't played long enough to do this naturally, and as a result they tend to take harass very often and get easily exploited by players of higher elo. When the high elo player sees that the healthy distance is broken, he feels something in his gut and either moves back or attacks in response to it. When two equally high elo players play against eachother, both will just maintain healthy distance and trade evenly and it won't seem that either of them are very skilled. But if you throw a bronze player in their, the bronze player will keep breaking healthy distance and the high elo player will harass on time. The high elo player will push him out quickly and the skill difference will be easily noticed.   In a macro sense, the games much more complicated than just ""dancing around in the lane"". What fights you can take is often decided by where the minions are in the side lines, what sorts of minion pushes are coming next, and specific level and item timings. That's usually the reason players don't fight when you think they should fight.  Heres some analysis on the micro game of apdo from an experienced coach who's dealt with some of the best players in the world ( last shadow ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZblvfOK9ajI  Micro stuff is mostly intuitive ( you're not consciously making decisions, but working off gut responses built from practice ) Macro decisions on the other hand are usually conscious. Heres a game analysis by Montecristo to give you an impression of the complexity  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eztmFLkzAPg  What do you say to Fakers and other LCS pro's abilities to reach higher levels of challenger anytime they want? Sure if you reach challenger once, it's evidence that you're in the top .0001% ( top 1000 of 30 mil ). But if you can do it multiples times on alts casually, then doesn't that make it extremely likely that you're significantly above other players?  If professional players are so overrated, why is the professional scene so stable? When two parties are equally skilled, they go 50/50. If LCS players were overrated and not actual superior to the average masters / low challenger player, then new challenger teams would do better more frequently when they enter LCS. In reality, new challenger teams almost always fail when they move up to LCS. Usually specific high talent individuals have to be taken from challenger teams and trained to match LCS talent.  Why would pro teams waste so much time and money making pro players practice for 12 hrs a day if they're only just as good as some random low challenger slob who doesn't play as much?  Why do you think faker practicing diligently for 16 hours a day for years wouldn't put him a cut above the average challenger?  You're totally misguided and wrong to underestimate pro players based on some troll performances on alts in diamond games that mean nothing. Your opinions on pro games are horrible in a similar way to that bronze player who has no clue what's happening when they watch pro games.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@白-g2s,I can't believe this is actually being argued with. Some people do not even care about their rank. Just because you play a lot of different champs and got to masters in 2 years it  doesn't mean anything. It doesn't say how many hours you actually put into this game nor the amount of ways you have tried improving by for example watching streamers. Nobody is saying it is impossible to do what you did. My point is that people who do not invest into the game should not be called lazy or dumb just because they are of a low rank. In fact I know many players who simply only play norms with a minimum number of rank games because they simply play for fun and don't care about a shiny masters rank which is in reality meaningless.,7년 전,2,

Sadly most of the LoL community is pretty toxic so you should expect this kind of things in your chat if you have so many viewers. And like you saw in this game. Not just low elo players are toxic. Just focus on the chat in her game. The difference is higher elo players are often smart enough to not flame all the time in chat. But believe this: They ARE flaming.  And btw. Just watch more videos of her. She actually is pretty toxic herself. I noticed that she is blaming her time quite severals of time if she is not doing so bad herself.

@100spoonsonatable9,"Actually Xerath shits on Lux, and Lux/Azir is is a skill matchup.  Xerath wins because his poke is far more potent, and you get outpoked garantueed, with little room for retaliation. You can dodge 70% of his skillshots and he'll still win. The only time Lux stands a chance is if she hits a bind; unlikely, because of his range, and even then she can't completely oneshot until level 11 -or if she somehow picks up 4 kills.",7년 전,0,

@Bugge5001,"You will never vs Faker either. People that call other people bronze trash are hardstuck as well, so please refrain from using it as an insult, you are probably not any better. I know any semi-competent player would gank a no sums lane level 2, but in my experience you can spam that the enemy has no flash and your jungler still won't care at all. Faker is not even overextended here, he just gets lane ganked right before he kills Poki, just unlucky.",7년 전,0,

@Abyssionknight,"Disagree 100%. These people are playing games in a public setting. Look at any sport and there are very clear divisions between people playing with the expectation to win, and people playing for fun. Entire leagues dedicated to making a profession out of their chosen game.   You do not however see professional athletes, or people who aspire to go professional, walk onto a baseball field in a public park, during a recreational league and then flip out when people aren't playing at the highest levels possible.   The same applies for league. Yes, there is a structure there for progression (just like in a recreational league in other sports) but it's still an unofficial public setting. More than that though, the matchmaking system is one specifically designed to try and give you a 50/50 win ratio, so it's inherently a system that's not designed for competitive play.   If you really want to take the game excessively serious then get a proper 5 man team and play together there, play in tournaments, or try to go pro. Going into solo q with the expectation of a super serious mature game is utter idiocy.",7년 전(수정됨),27,

That's the only way you will remember next time not to make the same mistake again... and obviously less mistakes means better game for everyone.

@yasuicideisidol1901,"Dude, ima give you the biggest league of legends break through of ur life. If you suck mechanically (ur in s2 u probs do no offence, no offence at all, srsly u dont need mechanics to climb not even joking ) just farm till 10 min. With the way silver players farm u could 1v1 anyone on their team. Also just let your opposition player push ( which they always do like the bronze trash they are) then set a freeze near/under your tower. Wait for your jg (due q with a semi-decent jg if u have to) free kill. Literally Free kill.  More info, (im only saying all this bc i want u to clime heaps for some reason idek), if your 0/1 play  safe, if your 0/2 dont bloody fight, if ur 0/3 OBVIOUSLY dont fight or even trade cause ur gonna lose 100% of the time.  Ye thats all the stuff that comes to mind rn. And its all the major stuff that helped me get out of bronze silver and gold. Just farm properly (10+ per min), roam a bit if ur getting screwed in lane, buy control wards, dont fight when behind and play around ur jgler and u will be gold at the very very least no matter how much u suk mechanicly.",7년 전,4,

@gilereth,"Dude, I've been playing for nearly a year now, placed s5 by the end of last season, b3 this season, climbed to b1 in two days and got bored so I stopped playing ranked, but I want to pick it up again.  Now, cs is one of my biggest issues. Since I've started following a couple streamers I've been working on it, and on my mistakes. I've been starting to actually SEE where I have to go, how I need to move, what objectives to take at what time, when to fight and when to disengage, of course most of it is probably still wrong, but I've been watching my games from a different point of view.  But that also makes me even more tilted, because when you're clueless you don't  mind your mistakes and everyone elses' (because you don't notice them), but there's certain games like today where I was playing Karma mid, and everyone who walked past my lane casually started farming my cs, exactly when I'm trying to actually focus on it rather than trading, killing, roaming, that's when I lose my temper. Botlane roams up chasing a kill, they get the kill, Vayne farms in my lane. Kha'Zix tries to gank but he's seen before he even leaves the bush, instead of turning around and leaving he crosses my lane and farms. Vayne roams up again and farms again. They didn't even push to the tower. And when I try to say something they tell me it's not actually MY cs, and that I need to stop crying. THAT is people who don't get how important cs is. Then again, at 10 minutes Vayne had 42 cs... And that's just one episode, I was playing Shen top a couple days ago and my whole team kept chasing kills and getting rekt, I couldn't say anything that I got laughed at. A totally winnable game was tragically lost.  How am I expected to climb like this?",7년 전,0,
@bm28r731,"It's literally just statistics. Without pulling the exacts as of right now, the last time I checked Bronze and Silver made up something around 75% of all league players.
