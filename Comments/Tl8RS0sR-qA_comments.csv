@NylesDixon333,4 me the folds are practical tablets not innovative phones. I wouldn’t get a fold as a phone I go outside with…it would be for things u don’t wanna do on a computer but wanna do on a phone. Or a trip and u don’t wanna bring a laptop or big ole tablet…bring ur fold with ur real phone.   Folding phones are new…I like the hardware on this bc it makes it more durable in my opinion.,3일 전,0,

@perhapsme988,"I hope iPad Mini dimension is used as foldable iPhones.  Simply fold the short sides of iPad Mini against each other.  The phone side would be wider and shorter than modern phone aspect but more like when iPhone first came out.  Once unfolded, the iPad Mini estate would allow iPad OS working perfectly. Hence all the advanced and enhanced features with new iPad OS would be available. App developers wouldn’t need to modify much if at all.  The ‘book’ format for other foldable phone simply is stupid. No tablets are like that shape at all. Apps are not in right shape presentation. App developers clearly don’t like this book shape hence very few apps literally fill up the book shape screen.  Then again foldable phones have come from the people simply assume 2 phones together is a good format.   If foldable iPhone were in book format, I certainly wouldn’t buy it, I’d rather carry an iPad with an iPhone.

You don't say ""two eks fives equals ten"" do you? It's math. It's multiplication. You're magnifying an image an ampunt of times. 3x zoom means three times multiplication. That's why we use the letter x. Please don't perpetuate knowledge. There will come a point where people say ""10 eks"" zoom and they've no idea where the x comes from.

@Tionge-f9j,"😭I'm trying everywhere, just hoping you see this  Hey Marques,   I’m writing this feeling a mix of hope and embarrassment, but I’ve been a fan for so long that I feel like I have to try.   I found your channel in 2017, and it honestly changed how I see tech. I've watched every single episode since. I don't just enjoy your videos, I study them. The video production is something like magic to me. You made me love tech, and your reviews are the final word for me for any tech purchase I even think about. I sometimes daydream about what it would be like to have that kind of access to technology and to understand it the way you do.   The reason I'm writing, and why this is so awkward, is that my reality is a world away from that dream. I'm a 4th-year pharmacy student at Levy Mwanawasa Medical University in Zambia, and to be honest, this year has been one of the toughest of my life. My phone was stolen in May, and then, cruelly, again in June. My laptop, which was my lifeline for research and assignments, has completely died. It's gone.  Trying to keep up with the research and assignments for my degree without a computer or a reliable phone has been a nightmare. It’s isolating and incredibly stressful. My parents, who have already sacrificed so much, simply can't afford to replace them. I feel like I'm failing, and the stress is overwhelming.   I know you probably get messages like this all the time (and I hope i don't find myself in your spam folder 😭), and I feel a little embarrassed even asking, but I thought, if there's even a tiny chance you see this and help, it would literally change my life. If not, that's totally okay...really. Just knowing you might read this and know that your work inspires someone like me, fighting through a tough situation thousands of miles away, would mean a lot, It makes me feel a little less alone in this.   Thanks for all the inspiration over the years. It means more than you know.   Sincerely,  Tionge Nyirenda from Zambia.",1개월 전,0,

@philipkuona,"Hi Marques,  With flagship phones like the iPhone 17 Pro Max packed with ""pro"" features, what percentage of owners actually use them? It seems many of us buy top-tier devices for the status, but our daily usage could easily be handled by a base model. Is the high-end market driven more by aspiration than actual utility?  This is where I think Google's philosophy with the Pixel line really stands out. Many fault Google for not matching the raw hardware of an iPhone or Samsung, but as you've said, their focus is on the user experience. The Pixel 10 might not top the spec sheets, but it delivers a highly functional package with clever, practical features that people use daily. Shouldn't that focus on everyday utility, rather than niche pro features, be the goal for more manufacturers?",1개월 전,0,

Why would I go anywhere else for an invisible camera bump while the software is way less convincing (and I tried).   Pixels are the best phones on the market,. especially if you like new techs and features, and interestingly enough, I work with a lot of engineers and tech nerds, and they mostly have Pixel phones, way more than anything else, because they know that's where you find ideas.

Agree with the point that a £2000 phone like this makes no sense. Especially when compared to some of the Chinese offerings and the Fold 7 in particular. They all wipe the floor with it and in some case cost a fair bit less.  And 6 hours SOT using the outer screen screen is pretty crap, it's got to be said.

@ChristianC-gy1ym,"As someone who is heavily invested in AAPL, a former iPhone owner, a current iPad owner, and someone who owned just about every phone out there - LG, Pixel, iPhone, Galaxy, etc I can honestly tell you that from an OS standpoint, Android is far better than iOS.  And among Androids, Samsung has by far the best ecosystem. In a day and age where the specs are so close and one would be nitpicking to say this or that has the ""better camera"" or ""better chip"", really there are only two main choices. One, choose the OS you prefer. Two, choose the ecosystem you are invested in. For diehard Apple fans, they can't get away from the Apple hemisphere.  It would cost them thousands to divorce Apple and start over in a new, let's say Samsung, ecosystem. And vice versa. If you're not an ecosystem person, meaning you just have the standalone phone.  Or standalone watch.  Then Pixel makes a very compelling case because of its pure Android experience and the less of a premium price.

@matheusguedesbaguiar,"I honestly don’t understand why Google barely sells any hardware in Brazil. All they’d have to do is not pull an Apple and charge absurd prices — or do what they did in India, pay a local manufacturer to assemble the products — and they’d be fine. We’re talking about a market of over 200 million people, plus the whole of Latin America and Africa, where they’re also practically absent. It’s… suspicious, to say the least. And what’s ironic is that they already have the lineup: Nest, Pixel, watches, speakers, everything. They just lack the will. Even with only 1% of global market share, you’d expect a bit more effort. Their hardware isn’t bad — the chip’s a little behind, and the cameras underperformed this generation — but still, I’d say Samsung and OPPO do it better. Even so, competition matters. So either step up and go global, or stop pretending.

@sidney1234usc,They need to put an outside cover display on the back as well so that you can take selfies with the phone close using the better cameras. I believe it would be simple just like how the z-fold flip is. As a matter of fact you should be able to use either side. So yeah put a display on every side of the phone 2:22,1개월 전,0,

@TheSchwiz,Personally I think these tech companies are looking at foldable wrong.  I dont want it to be two devices in one.  I want it to make whatever device im using smaller.  If by proxy it gives me extra features great.. but I want a FLIP phone that is smaller in my pocket and and folding tablet that is smaller to carry/store.  Having a medium to big phone that just becomes a small tablet doesn’t do anything for me. I already have a 13inch tablet and a 6.7 inch phone.. i dont need a device in the middle unless i actually replace both devices with it. And that’s not happening.,1개월 전,0,

Just a thought, because no matter what you do, if you have to keep babying your phone and still be skeptical of lasting more than a year, it's not worth it imo.",1개월 전,0,

@PKFat,"TBH I've become jaded by contemporary devices bc they're only rly being designed to herd ppl into their ecosystem & how the company envisions ppl using their products. If a user has their own use case in mind, or the user favors products from multiple vendors, it leads to compromises for the user. It's why I stopped buying Samsung phones despite rly liking the S pen - I'm not paying a premium price for a product that has a button I have to decide between letting occupy the real estate of something I paid $1K+ for, or going online to figure out how to hack the phone so I won't have Bixby forced down my throat. There's a comparable issue I have w/ my 2023 Pixel Fold - I personally prefer Nova launcher over the Pixel launcher. But when I unfold it Nova doesn't have permission to get rid of the Pixel launcher app bar on the bottom, & I'm still unsure how or if I can modify the apps listed on the bar, bc I don't use any of them especially in tablet mode. I have to accept the forced features on a $2300 phone I spent money on. Now Google wants to force Gemini into the Android user experience? The same company that's notorious for mining their users data wants in on my texts & calls? And it's not easy to opt out of putting myself in a vulnerable position to be exploited without having to cut half the features that sold me on the decice to begin with.",1개월 전,0,

So, the idea of folding screen just seems like we are going back in time to a cheaper display that bends when you press on the screen.

All the pieces are there for a phone older people and people who have trouble with small print would like. I do see foldable phones in Japan with old people quite a bit more. A folding phone can display larger text, a foldable phone is going to be better for reading, it’s harder to lose if it’s bulkier, etc.   Look, it might not seem “sexy” to market foldable phones as an accessibility phone. Go ask Subaru though, what leaning into its unpopular rugged lesbian reputation, did for the brand tho. Go ask KFC what leaning into a weird Japanese holiday did for its brand. Success in marketing is rarely about doing the same thing over and over, it’s about making a good case for yourself.   The only way this foldable phone gambit is going to work is if a utility argument can be made for it, THEN Samsung or Google or whoever can build from there. As it stand now, a folding phone is just a gimmick people don’t know if they want.",1개월 전,0,

Love or hate them, they aren't ones to compromise in such a way. They'll usually wait until a technology is matured and refine something to fit their design language. Foldable phones have matured and still cannot eliminate the ridiculous screen crease and overall ugly design. The day Apple releases a foldable is the day they will have truly stopped being Apple.  As a tech enthusiast, a foldable phone is an idea I want to love, but should never have left the prototype stage yet people's willingness to accept its gaping flaws caused it to see mass release.

@christianaviles2199,I disagree with MKBHD that Pixel and foldable is an incompatible concept.  The issue is Google isn't taking advantage of the foldable form factor in their software.  Like maybe have more apps that take advantage of the real estate besides just looking good side by side.  The fact that Android software has neglected tablets for so long really shows on these foldables.  It's also ironic that the Pixel Fold 9 was one of the thinnest folding phones last year.  And now one year later the Pixel 10 is considered chunky for a foldable.  I'm actually OK with the thickness as long as it helps battery life  but I do wish it was lighter.  It is a heavy phone.  That and give us the actual Pro cameras and the Fold makes a better argument for the price bump.,1개월 전,0,

@thecelestialstarship,"Diagonal screen size is a REALLY flawed metric for measuring phone size and portability, because it ignores the rise of bezelless screens  Example: base S25 is very one-handable at only 2.78"" wide. This isn't much more than the iPhone 6, at 2.64"" wide. yet when we compare their diagonals  (6.2"" Vs 4.7"") it seems like an insane difference. This is due to the iPhone 6's 16:9 screen  Essentially the S25 and iPhone 6 have a very similar physical size footprint. So it doesn't make sense to deride one for being 6+in and praise the other for being 4.7in. That's only their display size  For further comparison, take the 5.1"" Galaxy S5, which is actually wider than the S25 at 2.85"". (Admittedly, it is shorter, but I'd argue width matters for one-handed use. Height doesn't really affect anything). Even though the phone has a smaller diagonal screen size by a whole 1.18"", it still works out to be harder to use one-handed  If your issue is with the lack of even smaller (i.e. iPhone 5-sized) phones anymore, then fair enough. But even then, there's still fairly modern options (iPhone 13 mini, iPhone SE 3, Asus ZenFone 9)",2주 전(수정됨),1,

So now we are left with phones which are ever faster and more powerful ... but who does need that.

Maybe Google can do something with the normal Pixel 10 and partner with Pokemon and Marvel and Disney and Warner Bros and have like special editions with special gimmicks and cute gadgets to go along with em. They can do it for the Gpad, the GFlip and the Pixel. They are so many options. There are so many ways Google can make products that actually sell.

As an entrepreneur this phone is a better fit as 3rd personal device on wifi than your daily SIM phone.  Anyway I want this phone. It""s for me all the way! What ever drawbacks to camera it has to be better than my LG V60 from 2020. Also I'm not a gamer so I don't need the fastest Snapdragon Elite Gen 4 Possessor. I like Google's price point at under $1800. There will be bargain prices for the unlocked version and the Google Store.  I'm ready for an upgrade jn 2026.  The switch I made to Google Fi  doesn't support LG dual screen phones. I needed a Samsung phone as a hold over so I got  Samsung A16 just for the Samsung Ultra watch support.  The dust 6 rating is the reason I want this phone and the new bigger size battery is the other reason.

@Whoareyoucalling,"While I don’t forgive Google’s incompetence five generations of in house SoCs still performing on par with phones from 2020 I will give them credit for one thing: they didn’t chase ultra thin aesthetics at the cost of usability. The Z Fold 6 remains functionally superior to the Z Fold 7.   Sure, the Fold 7 looks sleeker, but it’s harder to handle, and even opening it feels precarious. The Fold 6’s slightly thicker build made it far more practical and comfortable to use.",1개월 전(수정됨),1,

@JamalLeeArchives,"The ""smartest smartphone"" thing never really made sense to me. Like every other phone does 99% of what the pixel does in terms of ai and smart features. The only things pixels really have that others don't or fully dont are superior voice to text and sending a message with your voice, and superior call screening. Everything else is on other phones and a lot of the time done better (samsungs ai features just work better imo and offer a bit more in the notes app).  There is that new magic cue thing that is cool in theory, but isn't that good yet. So yeah I just think the whole ""smartest phone in the room"" tag doesn't really make sense when it doesn't do much else and is worse is a lot of ways compared to other phones. Pixels also lack so many features (ya they all aren't ai or smart features but still), and are overpriced when you think about overall package across hardware and software.  Just some thoughts.

@mayp7129,"I disagree with the sentiment that Pixels are software-focus only phone. I think Pixel still carries the Nexus spirit into today as a ""reference"" phone. It's supposed to set the tone for the rest of the industry. Pixel a for low budget, Pixel for mid-tier, Pixel Pro for the premium device, and fold for the foldable device which is a device category of its own like a tablet is. It's supposed to signal to the consumer this is what you can expect from an Android phone at this price point. Other manufacturers could ""compete"" by doing something different like throwing bigger hardware at it, or providing niche hardware options. I think the Pixel-exclusive software is just Google putting in their own advertisements to upsell their own services to get you to subscribe, or have exclusive right to mine your data like Photo AI edit.

Also, update the iPad Mini front-facing camera and rear-facing camera to what is currently being used on the iPhone Air. Use the same A Pro chip in iPhone Air, iPhone Fold and iPad Mini.

@kamikazehound3243,"I feel that the bi folds/tri folda are the devices that truly need to be tablet hybrids not just phones that fold out to be bigger phones. Its a waste of the design. They should be able to run tablet apks and have tablet abilities. Regular folds do not really have to worry about that because the able is convince over a tablet when on the go and simply hsving a larger screen. While having tablet features on regular folds would be dope, its not important to the design but being thar the bi folds will fld out into true tablet size devices they will suffer from not having it. Only casuals will use it as a tablet replacement but people that use tablets for video editing, 3d rendering, etc, will realize that it would be a waste to buy.  Im not an apple fan but I honestly wouldnt be surpised if the old apple were to make a an actual hybrid into of a phone that folds out to be a bigger phone but this is the new apple so I dont see their fold doing that.  Beaides that, my 10 pro fold will arrive tomorrow  ao cant wait to unbox it. I personally more about battery than weight. You havent used a heavy phone until youve owned a tank pro 4. Camera wise, we have to stop acting like these cameras are bad on these phones, and by these phones, I mean all brands. We are at a point where unless you are buying a very cheap phone, your phone has a great camera. If you truly care about camera quality, you would be using a phone but a real camera. Pixel, Sammy, Apple, Xiaomi, all have great cameras. Think about it this way, 2 years ago the best phone camera was praised but if a phone comes woth that camera today, peoppe will complain and call it a bad camera meanwhile real photographers do not bash old cameras from back in the day that do not have to latest and greatest hardware.

@AbeDillon,"​ @Tekapeel  0.14 mm isn't relevant to any sane person. This is just a knee-jerk rationalization of consumerist brain-washing.  Every day, since practically the day we're born, we're bombarded by propaganda that tells us that we're incomplete, we need to buy X product to be truly happy. We must seek fulfillment through consumption.  This is on purpose. After WWII, people were concerned about the US economy crashing when production wound down. The solution was articulated by the economist Victor Lebow:  ""Our enormously productive economy demands that we make consumption our way of life, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek our spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. The measure of social status, of social acceptance, of prestige, is now to be found in our consumptive patterns. The very meaning and significance of our lives today are expressed in consumptive terms. The greater the pressures upon the individual to conform to safe and widely acceptable social norms, the more does he tend to express his aspirations and his individuality in terms of what he wears, drives, eats, his home, his hobbies, his vacations. We need things consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-accelerating rate""  You could just stop. Deprogram. Realize that consumption isn't the path to happiness. It's all a lie. Use that $2k to help people instead of trying to impress whomever is impressed by 0.14 mm thinner bezels. It would be infinitely more rewarding.   Having super high standards just means you've decided not to be happy. That's that consumerist training kicking in. It doesn't make you a better person. It's not smart. It makes you more miserable for no reason.",1개월 전(수정됨),1,

@AndroidDigest,"So one phone has a bigger battery. The other is thinner and lighter. One phone has a wider aspect ratio the other has a taller one. One phone has better smart software features the other has more power with the Snapdragon 8 elite. This phone actually does a good job competing with top foldables. But this feels like a lazy review because you didn't even show camera samples and talk about the cameras. Just because it doesn't have the highest end power you automatically said it was incompatible, Google making a folding phone, but didn't really give a logical explanation.   You just shared that the phone was a little heavier. Gave some basic specs. And just said most people won't buy it but it's still good. You could have compared to this with the Z fold. You could have talked about the cameras. You could have even given some real-world use cases with gaming where this phone may fall short. But then show how it's better than the competition in other ways. I love your channel but I think you missed this review. I plan to do a comparison with the Z fold soon and hopefully I plan to cover some of these things",1개월 전,0,

@freon_bale,"I've been using a Pixel 9 Pro Fold since they first came out, and my views differ from yours. First off, the reasons you specify for going Pixel are WAY different than mine. The main reason I, and many other tech savvy people go Pixel is for Stock Android. We want the updates and new capabilities the fastest Google can create them. Second is build quality and battery duration, both of which the Pixels (I started with the Pixel 5) deliver on. And as to the folding screen, I present two use cases that you did not comment on, and yet they are critical when recommending this phone. First, in addition to the Pro Fold, I also purchased a folding Bluetooth keyboard/mouse and a case that has a kickstand. This allows me to use the Fold as I might a laptop or tablet, and has actually made it so I don't have to have a laptop anymore for work. It's amazing. And second, the people who are most interested in my fold when I am using it, are senior citizens. The screen is WAY bigger, and makes it easier to use with those that don't have great eyes. I could also add that if you view lots of video on your phone, the bigger screen is WAY better. Same with games.",1개월 전(수정됨),146,

Not only does it have worse cameras than the $800 Pixel 10, it has worse cameras than my 4-year-old Pixel 6 Pro.  Google, aside from reading, the second most common thing I would like to use a foldout screen for is to edit and manage photos and video more easily than on a standard phone. Why would you put the worst set of Pixel 10-series cameras on the phone with the best built-in display for photo editing, especially when you have another phone also called ""Pro"" with a much better set of cameras.

@ar333b,"I'm using the original pixel fold (the best camera I could get on a folding phone) and the amount of third party apps I have to use to get a somewhat comparable experience as my z fold 3 is absurd. I did NOT know pixel experience would translate to borderline iPhone levels of limited customization. Your home screen on outer and inner displays can't be customized separately (my use cases for the 2 screens is different, why can't I have the homescreens reflect that? (I had to use 2 different launchers and (I believe) macrodroid or something and weeks of tinkering to get 2 different launchers to work on my phone), no edge gestures like you get through goodlock (found a third party app for this) and the worst offender, no Miracast (everything from my TV, to random projectors support it and I can't find a workaround besides having to either sell every electronic I own to get one that Google will allow me to, or get another Samsung)   Google is trying so hard to be Apple. We didn't need another Walmart iOS, Android was always about freedom. If I wanted a walled garden (or luxury prison) I'd have made the switch. If you're a power user looking for a folding phone, just go with Samsung. The cameras are a slight downgrade, but you get everything I mentioned above, plus much faster charging. I can't even find any ROMs for folding phones that could save me from them killing side loading. Again, what's even the point of Android when Google is just trying to be dollar store iOS.",1개월 전,0,

@JoeDonahue,This is the most compatible Pixel phone yet. The hardware is easily surpassed by most of the competition and hopes software will compensate for it. It is an emerging form factor that Google has representation for in its catalog. They will look at what others do for software to add value to a folding phone and then bake some of those features into the OS itself. A subpar hardware experience that serves as a testing platform for the operating system. What could be more Pixel than that?

I took the $75 loss for the restocking fee, I would have to picked up the new Pixel Fold but the store was out of stock. Using the Pixel Fold the store had on display you clearly see and feel that the Pixel Fold is a better device than the Fold 7. The only thing the Fold 7 has over the Pixel Fold is, it's thinner. Also, some stores are being quiet on the return rate of the Fold 7 in particular by folks who went from the iPhone to the Fold 7.",1개월 전,0,

@mannydcbianco,"I got the 9 Pro Fold last year. Liked it, a lot, despite some really annoying nerfs (primarily camera, battery size, charging speeds), but in the end, when the 10 series dropped, I traded it in for a 10 Pro XL. 85% of the time I much prefer the 10 Pro XL: bigger and better front screen, better battery, faster charging and better camera. But for those remaining 15%.. oh boy do I miss the large fold-out screen. Like when I'm waiting at the tire shop for my car, on the bus, web browsing in bed. That's when the Fold really shines and absolutely destroys a regular non-folding phone. I will probably still stick to a regular slab phone when the Pixel 11s drop next year, but man do I miss the large screen at times.",1개월 전,0,

@NeXusVM,​ @ネイチャーウォーカー I have never had an issue with my pixel and I've had every pixel from 7a and above. Only issue is high performance games like call of duty. When it comes to day to day multitasking I have never had issues with it and it handles it quite well. Benchmarks do serve a purpose but it isn't the end all be all. The average consumer cares about how a cell phone will make their lives more simple and easier. To be able to function and work for them. And no other phone outside the pixel does this to a high standard. I've owned Samsungs from the note series to the ultras and I have had iPhone pros and max. When it comes to what the average consumer wants it doesn't get any better than pixel. Apple of course has better app performance due to their OS being simplistic in nature. And of course Samsungs and apple will be great for content creators who edit videos on their phones or stream mobile games. But you are talking about a very small percentage of people.,1개월 전,0,

@deelowe3,"They're still low volume products. Regular phone screens, tvs, and monitors all share the same panels so they benefit from economies of scale. Curved displays and folding phones use the same panels but people generally don't want curved displays. So the market is much smaller meaning costs won't come down as quickly if at all.   The reason for this is that the cost to produce a single panel is very high but almost all of that cost is in the manufacturing process itself. Once the mfg line is built, the panels themselves are relatively cheap. If the panel maker can sell 1000s of panels, then the costs come way down as they are able to spread the start up cost over many more units sold",1개월 전,7,

Fact is, yall have fallen for the marketing gimmick. Its a phone. Its one thing to say tensor chips have always been bad, but the faxt is these cameras were once considered good. Have any of yall ever stopped to think about why is it tis stuff is considered great and then a year later its not good enough? Its marketing. Plain and simple. People spend premiums to buy outdated cameras from the 80s that were top of the line in the 80s. The reason as to why is simple: if it isnt broken, why fix it. Right now, the LG V30 is considered one of the best devices to use as a DAP yet its an old ass phone from a decade ago. Fact is, it works and is good. Yall need to open your eyes. Yearly updates is a waste of money and only casuals will do that.

Never had any problem doing this on a normal phone but it was better. And again didnt do it often when unfolded. Not to long ago bought a new tablet it's also an flagship and now i dont realy use the big screen any more. For the same price i bought my Fold you get a flagship phone and a tablet, i think for most it is better.   I get the idea of foldable phones, and im kinda into it but still miles away where they are what they want to be. Im happy i bought it for the experience but my next one is again a normal phone and no fold, one is enough for now.  But by what you want, maybe it's exactly what you need ore want.
