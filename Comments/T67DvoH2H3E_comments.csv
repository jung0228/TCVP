We only think eating eye balls etc is gross because our culture tells us it is. In some cultures, organs and such are considered delicacies. Also, I think what's more fucked up is killing a chicken for its breast meat and legs, and discarding the rest of it when there's people starving in other parts of the world that would quite literally kill for an eyeball, tendon, etc to eat. Especially when it tastes as good as it does in a mcnugget. Grow up America. Its not that gross.",10년 전,77,

@OverlordShamala,"When she said muscles are thrown in, she doesn't realize that muscles is what we often eat from the chicken. So what do she think we eat when we consume meat?  I think that no one knows how sausages are made. It's been even shown in History Channel describing foods & the preparation of foods. So all suasages & salamis all use leftover meat. Been happening for centuries now. Boy hope there isn't some political movement to ban sausages of all types.  In ancient times & still archaic cultures in the Amazons, New Guinea, Africa. When they consume the animal, they eat everything of eat, including the guts. Nothing is wasted. So if people don't know what they eat, then I guess ignorance is bliss.  People that make their own homemade sausage & during curing, some fats breakdown, which naturally produces ammonia which increases Ph in the meat & inhibiting the growth of bacteria.  Maybe the issue is how much ammonia is used for the process of these protein known as pink goo? Is that the issue?",11년 전,9,

@robinvan1983,@Bigbird5553 like i told you 50 minutes before. these aren't safety standards. the 10 mg/kg/day is needed to get mercury poisoning. that has been tested and studied. Safety standards is something totally different.  that is the  maximum amount allowed to be in food/water or whatever.  That is always easily a 100 times lower than what it might actually effects you. You seem to be lacking to understand that.,14년 전,0,
@Bigbird5553,"@robinvan1983 lol no.  you still don't get it.  I'm saying the the safety standards are based on what?  Human study that gave a measured dose to human volunteers/participants then measured the effects of mercury poisoning?  How was it determined that .002 mg/l of mercury is safe?  lol anyhow just go back and look at your comments to see how they have evolved to doubt casting to ""I am now a google expert"" taking less time then a 4th grader for his book report to make the determination. Eat up! ",14년 전,0,
@robinvan1983,@Bigbird5553 you are an idiot that isn't a safety level. That is when you get mercury poison. Those are the levels needed to get symptoms of mercury level poisoning. You've totally misread and ignored my whole explanation. I based it of the HFCS that has mercury in it. if you drink 1000 liters of that you get symptoms of mercury poisoning  The safety standards of mercury by the fda is way lower: (0.002 mg/L). you are inept to us relativism you don't know scales and don't have the proper educ.   ,14년 전,0,
