@mikeofmetal760,"The real skittles are made like jellybeans or M&Ms the center is pressed in a mold then it's put in a tumbler. It's like a small cement mixer without paddles inside. I think it's called panning. They are misted with water as they tumble, then it's like confectionery sugar gradually built up, then color is added, spinning constantly. Then they put a bit of wax to polish and prevent stickiness. I'm surprised Clair didn't try to watch a video of their manufactur. They make the stars for fireworks the same way, built up around a rice hull.  Oh and jawbreaker/godstoppers are built up like that too.",6년 전,4,

Great job and great work for working on your own candies!

@sarainiaangelsong440,"That's a long strung out process, takes alot of time and very likely in costs of ingredients also much more costly as well, so with both Time and Money being more in each category, I think it's cheaper and quicker to buy skittles from a store, I doubt the skittles company takes that many steps either, it's prolly down to a science for the skittles company, I mean if Clair can work long enough in the skittles factory to the point she sees and knows the entire process, there prolly then can be officially the middle ground of getting it just right in between her way and the traditional skittle way, and be able to use real colors and real fruits and make it a very healthy treat minus the butter, if there is anything with natural sugars the better! But yeah personally I wouldn't have 3 weeks to make this or a day or two if that is the case, cuz the initial startup to get the kit together and the ingredients plus the power bill to run the electricity I don't think I would pay that much to make a candy! Maybe if I was like mass producing it or Taking all the candy pieces I made and (added the costs of all Electricity, Bowls/Utensils, Kits, Ingredients, Taxes, Hours at Minimum Wage put in, And finally for the profits add an additional 15% on top of it all and divided that amount rounded up to nearest nickle into the amount of candies I made) then yeah it be worth my time and money to do it and sell them! Surely there must be a ""Faster, Cheaper, route to be both Healthy and Tasty"" so until a middle ground is discovered I will buy Skittles from the store thanks! :)",6년 전,0,

@nathanrogers8713," @TheOldAmishMan  No. Black Currant is a berry where licorice is a root. Radically different flavors. Black currants are not native to North America and they serve as a disease vector for White Pine Blister which can be devastating to the timber industry so their cultivation is largely prohibited. The flavor is not banned, it just isn't widely available due to lack of cultivation.",6년 전,2,

@danielhill8926,"Imagin one afternoon in your kindergarten class a friend brings Skittles for snack time. The teacher seeing he only brought one bag decides to give everyone in the class two Skittles apiece, and you so happen to be the lucky child that gets one green skittle and one yellow skittle. Thus your love for Skittles begins. You go home to your mother and ask her to buy you a bag just so you can experience the joy of the lemon-lime heaven you tasted just mere hours ago. Now flash forward fifteen years, fifteen years of life filled with its ups and downs and one of the very few joys you get in life is mixing your two favorite flavors together to achieve natural bliss amongst shattering reality. Lemon-Lime. Now your mother tells you to go to the local store for her afternoon fountain drink, which is ninety-nine cents at the time, and upon completing said purchase you find that you have enough money for your favorite treat. You go reach for a bag, expecting to find the sweet flavors of eternal happiness, only to see they changed the flavor to green apple. Upon trying this blasphemous flavor you realize that this skittle single handedly destroyed your childhood and all fond memories that go with it. Suddenly your once perfect life is marred with utter corruption, you start to fall apart, you think for the first time ever that maybe this isn't you candy anymore, that this candy ( like all the other things in your life ) has abandoned you to the wayside merely just to try a new flavor; not realizing they were committing the greatest sin since eve bit the forbbiden fruit. You life, reality, and very essence are now shattered. All this, because someone decided green apple was better than lime.",6년 전,0,

And the kicker is, I'm NOT even one of those Eco health do-gooders or whatever the term is for it. No hate intended to them, I don't think what I've called them has any bad or negative description of what they do, unless u think do-gooder is negative then I apologize, but I see the term do-gooder just meaning someone trying to do good within any aspect of something. Anyway back to my point, ever since that video where they introduced that no waste concept into their videos like composting and so on, I can't help but see all that stuff she made that were unsuccessful attempts and wonder what happened to all of it?

@shirel.a8421,Okay so heres the reasoning behind the US problem with blackcurrent. Currents can carry a type of like fungus that causes rotting... in the north it caused a problem with a native species of pine that was really sensitive to this new fungus and it killed a lot of trees which isnt good cause lumber and the forest so they banned it up there. We tend to have fake current at times but now a days currents are making a comeback to the US and I had artificial current in some gummies and I loved it.

@TheRedeye6,"So real skittles all taste pretty much the same. That is, the filling isn't flavored differently with extracts or additives. The different ""flavors"" come from scents that are part of the hard sugar shell. You smell lemon, you see yellow, your brain tells you you're going to taste lemon. A little bit of citric acid is pretty much all they do flavor wise to reinforce that. So the flavors come more from your anticipation of flavor than the candy itself.",7년 전,0,

Process is called panning and its how candymakers have done hard candy coatings for at least a hundred years. much less of a headache. would like to see you come back to this and try doing something along these lines and see if its less frustrating.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@Draukagrissah,"Dunno if you're serious but... a candy coat is basically dead easy. You bring a loose candy syrup (equal parts water and sugar) to the hard crack stage, flavor it if needed, color if desired. Put the candies you want to coat into a big ol huge bowl and roll around to coat them.  Fun cooking tip, if you're a masochist this would be how you make layered jawbreakers in a home kitchen. Start with a hard candy, then just coat it in layers of candy coating of different colors. But if you do this and you're not a manufacturing company with industrial drums... yeah you crazy.",7년 전,1,

If any other animal just changed their diet they'd get sick and die. the original skittles are full of poison, if that's really better then whatever have fun being sick. ever wonder why theres so much illness and disease? it's because people go on stupid diets that their bodies were not designed for and eat GMO food. We need to eat how people did before the industrial revolution if you want to be healthy. we are animals. we are omnivorous. and if you're vegan for ethical reasons, guess what, vegans cause death of millions and millions of bugs constantly from all the pesticides that are sprayed on your ""healthy"" veggies. not only that but your farms take land from wild animals, oh no! just seriously get over it",7년 전(수정됨),3,

Apparently it can affect different areas of hair, but when it affects hair right above the forehead, as with these ladies, it's popularly known as ""white forelock"".  Interestingly, of the three famous people Wikipedia cites as displaying the condition, the one that they have a photo of, Stacy London, has her streak in the some place as the pastry chef and quantum expert, and she's half Jewish.  Perhaps it's one of those conditions that people of Jewish descent are disproportionately afflicted with.  Though ""afflicted"" is a rather ugly word to use for such a pretty feature.

@EmmaAppleBerry,Some people have birthmarks in their head and the hair that grows from either darker or lighter skin than the rest of their scalp ends up darker or lighter than the rest of their hair. Theres also like albinism where you have patches and results in the same thing. Some people just get grey hair in patches rather than a strand here and there. That or their melanin gradually stops producing for whatever reason and theyll have that happen. In sections of their body.  I have blonde hair but a cafe au lait birthmark and the hair on the birthmark is a dark blonde light brown (on my limb not head) so yeah most people will hide it though just to avoid looks and questions. Its actually pretty common. A classmate of mine was dark red haired but he had a birthmark that went over his cheek onto his scalp and the hair on the birthmark was brown so he had this patch of brown fringe and the rest of his hair was really pretty deep red. So yeah i dont know her reason but i highly doubt its dyed that way. It looks too natural,7년 전,17,

And you don't really know how to make candy, you can't remake yhe formula. You have to start from scratch, that goes with first discoveting the texture and recipe and materials used to make the skiddles, and then working from thete up so you don't have a yuky gooey substance ozzing from the candy. It has to be presentable. Your pastry skills ate immature.  I'm a commrntator, and these ate my throughts. Sorry to be blunt and honest, but you have a lot of maturing to do, before you can have good candy and white streaks of old on your young hair. Also, get a boyfriend, not a girlfriend, and accept that you need one. A good one. Not just anyone. But you need one. So he can make you happy again.

@davidlong2338,You couldn't do grape? You said you tried freeze dried grapes. Maybe regular raisins? Grape skins maybe? I feel the grape flavor is more so in the skin where their odd type of bitterness also comes from. Maybe use their meat to tame it if it's too strong. Grape meat alone tastes more like sweetened gelatin so using the meat as the base for the flavor won't create a noticeable grape flavor. Grapes are just one of those fruits that are more difficult to translate into natural candy flavor.,7년 전,0,

@davidlong2338,"It was just a suggestion as raisins are just dried grapes anyway. They taste different because raisins don't have the water from the grape anymore. Saying a raisin tastes different from the original grape is a nonsequitur in this case because as I said, it's the grape skin that, for me, creates the iconic bitterness of the grape. The grape meat alone doesn't have a particularly unique fruit flavor. Eat any dried fruit & you can say it doesn't taste the same in every case (duh). The whole point of my suggestion was to get that iconic grape flavor. You didn't really add a whole lot to the idea of creating a natural grape flavor for candy.",7년 전,0,

@sunscreen7205,"IN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776 The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. — Such has been the patient sufferance of these",7년 전,0,

Reduce to a simmer, and simmer until the water is the desired shade of orange (approx 25 - 30 min). Let cool. Using a blender, puree everything and pour through a strainer. Transfer to a clean jar.

""There's no such thing"" - She replies.   Yes, yes there is. Companies use it for MANY different things. Pressed sugars are used to make things such as Jawbreakers as well as many other candies. The sheer pressure can cause it to be a harder or softer texture.  I dunno. I get that sticking a dumb person in front of a camera can get views, but just disregarding what someone else is saying like that when they clearly know or can intuit things better is pretty annoying.  And don't even pretend she doesn't stuff her face with all of these candies that she claims she ""Hasn't eaten in forever"".

@TimetravelingArchaeologist,"There were so many unnecessary steps in this, though I suppose some of it can't be avoided in a home style kitchen. Great job at the end, and the little measuring spoon tongs to shape them worked out very nicely. But skittles are made as a toffee base and poured into moulds, there is no pulling of sugar in the original recipe. The coating is probably applied in a drum that is constantly turning, same for the colour, and then a final turn with the wax to polish the shells. At least that's now the coating is applied to candy coated chocolates. Also so sad about the lack of grape, but grape is my favourite and I can't imagine that it can be improved upon.

If I give you mashed potatoes with just salt & butter, then another pile of mashed potatoes from the same batch where I've blended in lots of garlic, they look nearly identical but definitely do not taste the same. There will be similarities, sure, but one of them is now noticeably garlicky.

@thehelencheng,"I really love these videos, but - unpopular opinion here - I get annoyed that Brad is in so many of them. It makes sense in this video because everyone gets involved and he seems to especially be Claire's friend. He's a fun guy and I love his videos. But the rest of time - in videos featuring other people - it feels like a self insert that distracts viewers from the main person, and so many of the comments end up being about Brad. I'm not sure if he understands that by being present, he's stealing limelight from other people because of his sort of fandom. Maybe the original people are fine with sharing the limelight, but I feel like his popularity drowns out the appreciation for the person who made the video in the first place. They work so hard, only for tons of comments to talk about the 5 seconds Brad was in the video. So, nothing against him, but I wish Brad was in less of them, so more people can focus on and appreciate the original creator.",7년 전,0,

The tumbler ensures they are evenly coated with it.  Then they pour in some ladles of coloring liquid, and the tumbler ensures they are evenly colored.  That's all there is to that.",7년 전,0,

@giant-speck,"Blackcurrant is not really much of a thing in the United States because the actual crop itself is heavily restricted.  That's because the blackcurrant is susceptible to several different pests and diseases and historically, attempts to introduce the blackcurrant crop in the United States has resulted in damage to forests due to a fungus called ""white pine blister rust"", which affects other types of trees.   Green Skittles were originally lime, but were changed to green apple around 2013.  Several confectioneries made in the United States have made a transition from lime to green apple, to include Skittles, Sweet Tarts, Runts, and Lifesavers, because market research suggested in the 2000s and 2010s that green apple would be a more popular flavor than lime.",7년 전,1,

@KingBarney,"Oliver del Toro It's a trick taken from Journalism, these kinds of videos are intended to go viral and be shared, proper nouns don't add to new people's desire to click. Honestly when I see names, I think ""Okay, I don't know this person, so there's probably some inside jokes and what not I wouldn't get"", but videos like this honestly are more clickable and I can say I wouldn't have clicked if her name was in it. You see a clean and professional title that perfectly delivers the video's purpose and you just click. Same thing applies to a pair of videos from a male pastry chef testing boxed cakes and girl scout cookies, they both say ""Pastry chef reviews blah blah"".",7년 전,5,

@rfldss89,"I think it's because people watch brad's show not necessarily because he has any expertise on fermenting or fishing or hunting, but because it's brad. While claire's maybe has some form of degree that would allow them to use the term ""pastry chef"" or something. In short, claire's show is more driven by the knowledge she brings, while clearly brad's show is about his personality and the editing jokes etc. I don't thinks it is because of any form of sexism or discrimination. I'm sure claire and brad have a say in the title since they're the faces of the channel afterall.  Also, claire's series probably attracts more viewers coming from non-subscribers because of the premise, and BA is probably trying to take increase that effect by creating more clickbaity titles.",7년 전(수정됨),57,

@atomicbrain9401,KaWaWu KaWaWu probably because Brad has an actual show while Claire is doing an informal video series that is mostly targeted at going viral. Using a generic title looks better when sharing videos because it easily conveys the video content to the viewer without confusing them or making them lose interest by using proper nouns. Example from another channel on the related videos “A burger scholar breaks down classic regional burger styles”. They could have just listed the person’s name but it might cause less people to click unless it’s some super famous chef they’re naming.,7년 전,20,
