@bunnyofdeath8465,i think she mentioned on an instagram story she just didn’t feel comfortable on youtube anymore- she mentioned overworking herself on here a lot- like she was maxxing out on credits while editing for hours since she had to film multiple takes for everything she recorded because she was so finnicky about making the viseo perfect so tbh i’m not surprised she burned herself out and moved on. i’m sad she never gave us closure but i don’t blame her for wanting something different for herself,2년 전,3,

I like this idea (though if I did such brick wall I wouldnt do the one you did but I liked seeing something different as I feel youtube has some videos with the same ideas filmed by 4000000 people (yawn) anyway Im starting to ramble.

@Schmetterling_Honey,"Bed bugs are no joke, you basically have to bake your entire house (lethal temperatures)  to kill them. Look it up. Fumigation.  Increasingly, it is being used to battle bed bugs. Buildings to be fumigated are emptied of people and pets, and then 'tented' (enclosed and sealed within special tarps). Heat penetrates into small crevices that cannot be inspected. Lethal temperatures for bed bugs range from 117 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 F. The walls of hot boxes reach a higher temperature than the suggested lethal range in order to permeate belongings placed within, killing all bed bugs in all their stages.   So.... be careful with that shit, bc a can of raid spray cant help ya  lol  Ive never experienced them before, I learned about this from watching some freaky ass bug infestation show.   BTW your room turned out Super nice! Everything compliments itself.  ^_^",6년 전,0,

@kristineo6600,"Applying a primer to that Styrofoam would have saved you the trouble of having to apply multiple coats of paint. The s-foam won't absorb primer, and the paint will stick to the primer therefore avoiding being absorbed and turning the s-foam to MUSH. I am watching this video as I comment and I have to say you are doing an amazing job!  By YOURSELF, NO LESS! Oh no...Did you just say something about a sewing machine? Please don't use that machine on top of the glass-topped desk/table. It will shatter faster than you can say, ""Mind your own business, Bitch. I'll do what I want!"" when you start it up and attempt to sew something fabulous. That being said, you have a lovely, self deprecating un-selfconsciousness (is that a legit word?)and a bright, enthusiastic energy that translates easily to video. All of this, plus being very pretty without any of that irritating ""look how pretty I am, everyone!!"", will serve you well in whatever you do.  Well done💜",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@clay9408,"Guys, I have a few makeover “tips”. (I would not care to make a video, tyvm!) 1. #YouDoYou! Don’t be afraid. I’m moving out when I’m 18, but I currently live at my parents house. We had no more room, so I made a bedroom in the garage. It was like a REALLY huge normal(ish) bedroom. There are brick walls and the floor is brick in there. I thought it would be TERRIBLE, but I put carpets on the ground, it helped. I painted the walls white (my aesthetic main colour(sorry, shade for gods sake!) ), and it turned out good. I personally turned out loving it.  2. Be careful!  If your planning on painting, be VERY careful where you are painting. Paint doesn’t get off, so one tiny mistake could turn into a HUGE one...I accidentally dropped white paint on my carpet, yes. I just flipped it over, and it’s literally a sequin carpet (I do NOT regret buying it!)! I’m not saying be SO careful it’ll take you 5 years to paint a brick or something smh. But I AM saying don’t goof around with it (that felt weird typing lol).  3. Not too colourful! I know before I said YouDoYou, but...not too colourful you! It could turn into a HUGE mess if it is too colourful! You CAN do pastel blue, light pink, or pastel yellow (well any light, pastel colour I guess), but not neon. Neon could literally make a HUGEEEEE mess....so. Yes. Yes. Yes.  4. Don’t clutter it. Yeah uh...don’t place everything in one place, it could turn into a pigsty..AND DONT STASH IT IN THESE PLACES... 1. Closet. 2. Under bed. 3. In a box. 4. In the garage. 5. LITERALLY ANY HIDING PLACE TO MAKE IT SEEM CLEAN.  5: relax... When your cleaning, don’t stress about where everything is going to go. Sing to yourself, listen to YouTube or music, go to breaks, or take a few breaths before you start. Sigh...most people aren’t relaxed. 6: STICK WITH ONE COLOR. Uhm. Pretty self explanatory.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

Women are still not equal to men so that’s why it’s a huge thing. Men also get told that they can’t be sad and they need to ‘toughen up’ or ‘be like a man’ which I think it’s ridiculous because there are times in life where you might feel lost and upset.

@HarryThompson05, @katie7513  No one has ever said women can't build and do handy work. There is plenty of women designers and builders. Women get the same pay it's illegal to pay a man more for the same job. And toughen up and men can't cry and stuff is totally not true. Men do cry and toughen up and act like a man is a saying which is completely true. It's been proven that men are physically stronger then girls and that's where that saying came from,6년 전,34,

Once a person says one thing about women, you practically jump at the chance to say ""you're wrong!"" or to degrade them in some way. Really? Of course, there are amazing men out there but there are also terrible ones who molest, mistreat and discriminate women or anyone different from them. ""Man up"" is most definitely literal because you are saying ""act like a man and toughen up."" Why talk about that phrase anyway? It has nothing to do with what you are saying, just proving our point. The way men act has nothing to do with where they live because the truth is, if you can believe it, they are everywhere.

I'm an avid DIYer, mostly carpentry, and it's amazing how different my experience used to be when I went into home depot alone versus with my boyfriend (who doesn't know much past a power drill). When I'd go with my boyfriend, its no problem. But on my own, it's a different story. At best, the workers will keep asking you if you need help (not that helpful people are EVER a problem, but after 5 employees try to direct me to the command strip aisle, its hard not to doubt myself). But a lot of times I'll go in looking for a certain special screw or fastener that I saw online, and when I ask an employee where they could be after checking the fastener aisle, they have to ask what I ""need it for."" Even if I know the exact product term, gauge, and material. I've even had times where Ill tell them exactly what I need, in no uncertain terms, and they look at my boyfriend as if he'll fill in the blanks. This doesn't happen much anymore, because I've learned that I have to be more confident and assertive. And vice versa for men. I have some male friends who say they can't seem to flag down a home depot worker and keep their attention.

And in this case, decorating my room from zero  would not be a time waste for me either. But the wall.. that would be. Since it takes so long and is also super toxic and dangerous. And if you like staying home and just laying in bed and do that all day and nothing else, that is still wasting time. Or playing 15 hours of videogallmes instead of let's say decorating your room. Not everything you do and like is not a waste of time.",6년 전,0,

A light sanding and black flat paint on it would of tied it in with the color scheme, if needed. 3rd, if you ever wanted to go with a different look on the older mauve chair there are pretty cool tutorials on fabric painting for furniture that would totally be beneficial to wrap up the colors together.",6년 전,11,

@Luumus,"Sex is a healthy part of life, literally as you and I were born precisely because our parents had sex. She wasn't graphic about it, she was not bragging, it was a joke and she even thrown in some good advice for good measure (use protection). As long as it's consensual and between adults, ""younger viewers"" should know it happens (and they do), so what's the problem?  And yes, it's just you. Being a virgin or not is completely irrelevant and only brats and twats are proud of ""not being a virgin"" like seriously, nobody cares.   In fact, me thinks you are projecting. So please stop. Ironically the only people who care about virginity and ""low-key hate it"" when people talk about sex are, you guessed it, virgins (and sexually repressed people) and here's the thing, losing your virginity is something personal, it's about your partner, the situation you are in and how you feel about yourself, whether it's at 15, 18, 25 or fucking 30 years old. No one has the right to comment on your decision, and you don't have the right to comment on other people's decision. So don't hate and don't be judgemental over something so insignificant.

And just hearing you say that pissed me off! Like sorry, you’re lucky you feel like you can joke about it because you haven’t been affected, but from someone who sees that as such a raw subject I just found it upsetting and disrespectful for someone to say something like that... it’s not funny.

Fortunately, I'm not MOST YouTubers, so I can be more discriminate in my choices of the quality of things I wish to place into my mind.  What's stupid, if we are being honest, is following the crowd merely because ""most people do it"".  Have you no mind of your own?  And, of course, you can avoid it....you merely unsubscribe and search for better content.   Anyone with any sense can do that.

@marylandgirl7358,"Great job!!! May I make a suggestion...The bed in front of the window isn't good. The top of the bed should be on a full wall.  Can you move the bed (when you have free time) to the wall you put the desk and shelf on? Then move the desk and shelf to the wall at the foot of the bed, if it will fit. If it won't fit, move the desk and shelf to where the bed used to be.. It would look more aesthetically pleasing having the bed  on a full wall with out the window interupting the top of the bed. The bed is the focal point of the room. .Add another pillow to the bed, to balance it out. I LOVE all the DIYs you did. I also love what you did with the carpet.  Super cool.  Just trying to help.
