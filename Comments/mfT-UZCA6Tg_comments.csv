John 3:5 NASB  For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons and daughters of God. Romans 8:14 NASB  The one who believes in the Son has eternal life; but the one who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. John 3:36 NASB  Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a person sows, this he will also reap. Galatians 6:7 NASB  For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, Hebrews 10:26 NASB  Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are few who find it. Matthew 7:13-14 NASB  Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him. James 1:12 NASB  THINGS WHICH EYE HAS NOT SEEN AND EAR HAS NOT HEARD, AND WHICH HAVE NOT ENTERED THE HUMAN HEART, ALL THAT GOD HAS PREPARED FOR THOSE WHO LOVE HIM. 1 Corinthians 2:9 NASB  This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come. Matthew 24:14 NASB",3년 전,0,

Bob just walked over to her ...said 'Hi', and whatever else (it sounded lame...)...I'm Bob...here's my card...I'd love to take you out sometime...'  or something like that.    The way she relayed the story, it was as if 'Bob' assumed and expected her to 1) recognize him/know who he was and she'd therefore 2) gush all over him and act so 'excited' that he found her attractive.

@rodolfovitangcol12,"Be a Billionaire in RUVOL  I have invented a Board Game [still unpublished] that is guaranteed to be far more challenging and exciting to play than CHESS.  I called it “RUVOL.”    Over time, Ruvol will beat chess as the “Number One Board Game in the World.”   Why am I so sure about this?  Because I am an avid chess player myself.  I found chess to be so repetitive that any clever player could easily master each and every move to a point that they can even play against opponents blindfolded.  It is exactly for this very reason that I was encouraged to invent a game that cannot be mastered where each game is always a new challenge and exciting to play.  The global sales potential of Ruvol is just mind-boggling!    In my Google search, I found there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  I could readily assume every chess player in the world would be tempted to buy a set of Ruvol to see how it compares to chess.  At an average profit of just ten dollars per set, the global sales potential is a whopping US$8 billion.    I am selling my copyright to Ruvol!    If you are interested to buy my copyright, kindly give me your BEST OFFER.  The copyright goes to the highest bidder.   Or perhaps, you may know of some people who are in a better position to buy the copyright.  If that is so, refer them to me and email me their names. If anyone of them gets to buy the copyright, you will be awarded a 10% commission.  For security reason, the mechanics of the game will only be shown to the qualified or short-listed bidders.  “Early bird catches the worm.”  Thanks and God bless.

@brianwilson3952," @tyleru96  Because a lot of Americans (and im talking more about the Midwest) don't seem to understand any British accent, or even accents from their own country. I can listen to a thick louisiana accent and understand it. I love Americans, but they are deaf. Tom's impressions weren't dead on, but you could recognise who he was doing. Especially his Chris Walken. Anyway, Happy Christmas.",5년 전,2,
@tyleru96," @brianwilson3952  I mean, you make a fair point. I don't disagree that Americans - at least a significant portion - are ""deaf"" when it comes to different dialects of the English language; however, the same could be said about most people from the UK, too. For instance, if you were to ask the average Brit to impersonate an American accent, they're most likely to perform an exaggerated southern (specifically Texas) accent.    A lot of it depends on where people live, too. People who live in areas where there is a lot of diversity among the population tend to have a higher capacity for recognizing and understanding different dialects. With that said, the truth is that the average person, regardless of where they're from, is horrible at impersonating different dialects. Some people simply have a knack for impersonations. This is backed up by numerous studies on human language development and speech cognition. It's quite fascinating.    Thanks, same to you.",5년 전,4,
@brianwilson3952," @tyleru96  take ur point, but then why is it that most big network shows and films have so many British actors playing Americans. I think Britain(square mile for square mile) is far more multi cultural, and so we grow up hearing different dialects all the time. Plus we have more American TV than Americans have British TV. But yeah, the average Brit will automatically do a generic Southern or a Bronx accent, because that's probably what they hear most.",5년 전,4,
@tyleru96, @brianwilson3952  Absolutely agree with you that Britain is probably more multi cultural relative to size than the US (mainly due to the sheer size of the US and the lack of diversity that exists in a huge portion of it). I think you make a good point about American TV being shown more in Britain than vice-versa. That could certainly be a reason why British actors who grew up watching American television have an easier time picking up an accent for a role than their American counterparts.,5년 전,0,

Props to Tom Hiddleston for a great effort, but it needs a lot of practice. I'm not sure his face or his voice can ever reshape enough to feel like a true De Niro impersonation. I will say this, when he said ""So...."" in the voice of Pacino, I had great expectation that the rest was going to be an outstanding Pacino impersonation.

I was disappointed - was sure that by putting something of themselves in it, it would've been better.  Maybe Mann is particularly proud of that page or 2 of writing, and it was a dream come true to have those two do it, he just couldn't do it (to himself)?!",8년 전,0,

@immerse_yaself,Wooph - I don't want to be negative but I doubt that Niro was impressed.

@bellabana,People are 'missing the point' of his impression as he was impersonating De Niro's 'character/performance' in Heat NOT De Niro 'himself' there IS a difference. He could have easily done a straight 'over the top' impression of De Niro like everybody does but that's not what it was about as that's WHY he explained the movie in such detail first.  Get it now??? Also people think his 'Pacino' was better simply because Pacino almost always has the SAME 'accent' in all his movies meaning he sounds the same  in 'character' as he does in 'everyday life'.,9년 전,1,

So much great glory awaits all of you, my brethren. Close your eyes, and try to imagine the most amazing thing you could possibly think of. He has many great and wonderful things stored up for you! So many that you couldn't count it all! Think about it, all the food you've ever wanted, all the wealth you've ever wanted, and all the love and joy you could possibly imagine! I want every one of you to be holy and to enter the Kingdom of Heaven! Heaven is real! And we shall enjoy Heaven for all of eternity! Everything is alive in the Lord Jesus' Kingdom! Great beauty awaits you, and the Lord our God is coming back for his bride! We are his bride! Are you ready to be his bride? The Lord loves each one of you infinitely, and he died for each person too! So thank the Lord and make good use of this life and dedicate yourself to serving the Lord while he still has mercy on you! Pray to him and tell him your problems, he'll help you overcome everything! Please trust in our Lord Jesus! Place all of your trust in Lord Jesus Christ! The day of our Lord's coming is so near! The day of blessing for the bride is so near! Please get your garments and robes clean and without spot so that we could be his bride, and so that we could have a place reserved for us in Heaven. Build a relationship with the Lord who loves you so very much! The Lord Jesus is calling out to you! He's calling you loud, and all you got to do is to submit yourself over to Him and to surrender to Him completely! Great glory, joy, and happiness awaits you for all of eternity! Please come to the Lord and submit to Him and follow Him so that you can be His bride and be with Him for the Wedding Feast of the Lamb! Our Lord Jesus Christ is very forgiving and merciful while you are still alive, so if you are reading this, be happy! The Lord will forgive you for all the sins that you've done in your life, no matter what it is. You must be saved, and it's simple but challenging at the same time, but don't worry, the Lord will guide you! This is how to be saved... 1. Go to the Lord, and say the Salvation Prayer, Confess and Repent of all your sins to him, acknowledge that you're a sinner, say that you're sorry, ask for forgiveness, make the commitment to turn away from your sins, invite the Lord into your heart, and accept Him as your Lord and Savior. Now this is a vow, so you must keep your promise and don't backslide! 2. Make sure you baptize so that you make it more official, and so that you could receive the Holy Spirit.  3. Seek the Lord everyday in prayer! Remember that repentance means to turn away from how you lived before! Keep praying and be holy! Keep in constant communication with the Lord daily!  4. Rejoice and give glory to the Lord.  5. Always keep the Lord in your thoughts and Heart.  6. Make sure you loosen the cares of the world in your life. Don't indulge in sin or in the pleasure of this world.  7. Ask Him in prayer to count you as worthy and holy and righteous.  8. Always remain in repentance, and seek the Lord and His arrival. Be obedient, and keep your promise. Be faithful.   I love you all, I hope you get saved and remain holy and righteous! Please remember to always stay away from the world's sins and wickedness! Don't be caught up in the evils of this world! We are the Bride of Christ, so let us be holy and good and separate from evil! Let us also be wise virgins as stated in Matthew 25. Let us also always be ready for our Lord's arrival! Love Jesus with all your heart! He loves you so much and he wants you to follow Him because you are his child! He wants us in Heaven! Eternal life and salvation are free, all you got to do is just ask and trust in our Lord and obey him! To be saved, please follow the steps listed above, and dedicate your life in full surrender and obedience to our Lord Jesus Christ! See you all in Heaven, I'll pray for you!
