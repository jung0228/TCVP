Instead of using the occasion to complain he took the opportunity to be generous to me instead while he was engaging in small talk with me there. An American and a gentleman too.

@Cycles-ub2mr," @Paulafan5  I have never seen a comment as stup*d as yours in my life. Read the books and shut the f*ck up, because you have no idea what you're talking about. I have read all the books and for you to come here and say that the TV series is better is a great disrespect and a great display of ignorance. The television series is good, but the books are superior by far (And that shows in A Feast for Crows and much more in A Dance with Dragons). The book develops the plots more and the series all it does is simplify plots or eliminate them. The work of George R. R. Martin is splendid and the television series is nothing more than a transfer from the book to the series with actors. Games of Thrones (the series) is nothing without the book, literally nothing. And again, Games of Thrones is good, but the books are superior and anyone who's read the books realizes that, but since you didn't read them (because if you did then you'd be the d*mbest human I've ever seen) then You don't have the faintest idea. And beware, I'm not just talking about season 6 and 7, I'm talking about the entire television series.

The deadline and intangible date for the start of the Tribulations is the evening of November 12, 2023 --> HORROR ON EARTH.  It is your faith in the shed BLOOD of Our Lord Jesus Christ, on the Cross, which will save you from these Tribulations  Those left behind, on earth, will experience unimaginable horrors after the Rapture of the Church within 9 days, prepare to suffer for Christ, shedding your own blood for Him, for this will be your only possibility after the Rapture of the Church.  Because having refused HIS BLOOD TO THE CROSS until this Rapture of the Church, you will then have to suffer and die for JESUS CHRIST in order to obtain eternal life, at your death, because yes.... after your death earthly for CHRIST, you will go to Heaven, because you will have carried your cross.

@JackoBanon1," @carlosfer2201  Well, the end of the series is funny because in the books Daenarys is always fighting with her mental health starting from book 1 and always doubts her sometimes very harsh and brutal decisions against slavers and masters. In every book she fears that one day she will just become like her father - the mad kind Aerys.  In the series they almost completely cut that part out so I was sure that she wouldn't snap while watching the series and waiting for the last seasons and episodes. Then suddenly in season 8 she gets super jealous at Jons popularity and then is really, really pissed because of the death of her dragon and adviser and boom ... within 2 episodes her character turns from one of the most likable in the series into an absolute monster that destroys the main city and kills endless innocent civilians for almost no reason.

But no amount of years makes a certain thing not necessarily a spoiler. It could be a combination of years & popularity though like Shakespeare or even more recently Better Call Saul. The chicanery speech of Chuck from Breaking Bad spin-off Better Call Saul s3 is so popular that it's justified to talk about it even if it spoils s1.,2년 전(수정됨),0,

Why would Catelyn take a galley?  This is when she's hurrying to King's Landing to let Ned know someone tried to murder Bran, and to find the owner of the Valyrian dagger.  Doesn't she care that Ned condemned Jorah for selling poachers to a slave-dealer?    I think there are just mistakes everywhere.  Get used to it.  Sorry.  You would think there would be one person who would say, ""Jane Austen would not have said, 'It was given to Marianne and I,'"" but Emma Thompson won an Oscar for that screenplay.    You would think there would be one person who would have said, ""Members of Society would be making costumes for a costume ball out of old gunny sacks and drapes, not renting expensive costumes,"" in the sequel to ""Gone With the Wind.""  Scarlett says, ""The war is over and millions are dead because of it.""  It's an anachronism.  She should have said, ""Hundreds of thousands.""  No Civil War buffs on the whole set?  Maybe you could start a business in Hollywood, ""Mr. Anachronism,"" or ""Ms. Anachronism,"" but I think that's too long of a word.  It would have to be something like ""Goof Proof.""      If it's a really big mistake, like pretending ships under full sail can sit behind an island and surprise a dragon, the writers should be castigated, of course.",5년 전,1,

@mickymcbryan4814," Serial Margaret  I'd like to point out that the Aunt/Nephew thing isn't considered odd for anyone in westeros. Uncle-neice and cousin-cousin marriages are well recorded accepted things in westeros throughout all the noble houses.  Some examples, Ned was the child of two first cousins. Ned's mother had a father who married his neice as his second wife. Tywin Lannister was married to his forst cousin and the court viewed them as couple goals before her death. Sansa is briefly betrothed to her first cousin Robyn Arryn in the show and is in a more long term engagement with her first cousin Robert Arryn in the books where it's heavily established that she is to marry him and become Lady of the Eyrie after Lysa. If you want to go double jeopardy, Sansa becomes Littlefingers legally adopted daughter in the book so technically Rob Arryn is both her first cousin and step brother during their engagement. Again, nobody blinks an eye.  It's only immediate relations Westeros takes issue with for all but Targaryens.",6년 전,5,

@youhannabarrechit5649,"A paradigm shift will take place very soon perhaps this week, and it will be the celebration of the Blessed Hope, the Rapture of the Church of Christ, the Church will disappear from this fallen world, for you to enter in 7 years of horror on earth, and it is Biblical, it is the Tribulations.  The deadline and intangible date for the start of the Tribulations is the evening of November 12, 2023 --> HORROR ON EARTH.  It is your faith in the shed BLOOD of Our Lord Jesus Christ, on the Cross, which will save you from these Tribulations  Those left behind, on earth, will experience unimaginable horrors after the Rapture of the Church within 9 days, prepare to suffer for Christ, shedding your own blood for Him, for this will be your only possibility after the Rapture of the Church.  Because having refused HIS BLOOD TO THE CROSS until this Rapture of the Church, you will then have to suffer and die for JESUS CHRIST in order to obtain eternal life, at your death, because yes.... after your death earthly for CHRIST, you will go to Heaven, because you will have carried your cross. And don't procrastinate like today, debating nonsense like you do. Blessings",2년 전,0,

I like Sansa a lot more now. My favorite character is Ned, but naturally, he doesn't get much screen time lol. I don't really have a favorite character at the moment, but if I had to choose, I would probably pick Tyrion. He's grown quite a bit too. Dany is really lucky to have him. I hope that Dany doesn't drag him down though. I think things will be improving for Dany for a little bit, but I think her using the Dothraki is going to be a mistake. When the take over a town for her, they're going to pillage, rape, and murder, and I feel Dany isn't going to stop it. We'll see. If Dany lets something like that happen, then she's a reall ass hat lol. Hopefully Tyrion can counsel good wisdom.",9년 전,0,

@sophieludwig4115,"+Gabe Newell Actually, Ned Stark is known for his honor, it is highly unlikely for him to cheat on Cat with another woman, even Stannis Baratheon said it. Also, there is this mysterious promise he made to his sister Lyanna in a ""bed of blood"" when he found her dying at the tower of joy. And after that, the war was over and he returned home with Jon in his arms. As for the Targaryen features, Jon is said to have Stark looks, with grey eyes (in the show he has brown eyes, i know) and long face. If you play the genetic game here, it is more likely for Jon (if he was Lyanna and Rhaegar's son) to have dark hair, it is a fact of genetics, dark hair, skin and eyes are always dominant.

@petrirautiainen1492,"Tiedossa on ollut pitkään, että 1990-luvun lama oli keinotekoisesti aiheutettu pankkien saattamiseksi EU-kuntoon. Se ulkomainen velka, mitä syötettiin kotitalouksille ja yrityksille, oli aivan käsittämätön, suorastaan lainvastainen teko. Lainan ottajilta pimitettiin totuuksia, joiden seurauksena moni asuntovelkainen menetti asuntonsa ja terveitä yrityksiä ajettiin nurin. Koko EU-hanke perustuu valtiopetokseen, mistä kansalle annettiin harhaanjohtava käsitys siitä millainen EU tulisi tulevaisuudessa olemaan. Totuus osoittautui ihan toisenlaiseksi, mitä vuonna 1995 allekirjoitetussa EU-sopimuksessa annettiin ymmärtää. Salainen EMU-varauma tekaistiin vuonna 1994, jotta saatiin markka hävitettyä Suomen perustuslain 72 §:stä, mikä olisi kiireelliseksi julistamisen takia vaatinut 5/6 eduskunnan enemmistön. Tuo enemmistöosuus ei olisi tullut täyttymään ja siksi EMU-varauma tekaistiin salaisesti ohi eduskunnan päätöksen. Asiasta ei siis koskaan päätetty eduskunnassa. Kyseessä oli törkeä valtiopetos. Petos ei rikoksena vanhene koskaan. Kun riippumattomat tuomioistuimet hävitettiin perustuslain 2 §:n 6.5.1992 Presidentin linnassa järjestetyn oikeuspoliittisen tilaisuuden jälkeen, tuomioistuimet lakkasivat olemasta riippumattomia. Kyseisenä päivänä muodostettiin ns. Koiviston konklaavi ja kaikki petokset yksilöityivät presidentti Mauno Koivistoon. 1990-luvun aikaisia velallisia on tämän päivänkin Suomessa ja lama on vaikuttanut näihin päiviin asti, mutta kansa ei ole asiasta tietoinen eikä tiedä, mitä kautta vaatisi oikeuksia, koska kukaan, mikään taho ei ole kiinnostunut asiasta.

@Flippingboredcritic,"I had a funny theory that maybe the twins (Lannisters) are children of the mad king. Supposedly he had his way with Tywinn's wife on their wedding night. Mad King was said to have been drunk. And we hear Tywinn's say to Tryion, ""since I can't prove that you are not my own."" Why is Tywinn worried Tryion is not his own...? Maybe the mad king did have his way with Twyinn's wife. Why would he say that specifically to Tyrion? Sure Tyrion is a dwarf, but he's awesome he's proved himself time and time again. He's highly capable being, despite his size. Maybe Twyinn just hates little people lol. Anyway Targyens are known to have children with different color that isn't their own, like the Bareothoens (They are distant relatives of the Targyens). In addition it could explain the Twin's intense, obsessive, incest relationship. The Tarygrens were known to have incest relationships within their family, intense ones I might add. Aegon and his sisters. Visyena especially. Also could explain Cerseli strong attraction to Rheagar. I begin to wonder if attraction to one's sibling runs strong in the Tarygren line. But anyway inaddtion both Rheagar and Jamie were talented swordsmen, another similar characteristic. And if I go further, Joffery did display characteristics of madness. But to be fair, thats common for incest relations anyway. So wouldn't it be ironic, that Jamie might of killed his actually Father (the Mad King), and Tywinn's only true son was Tyrion all along....? Maybe when Tryion said ""I have always been your Son,"" could it really be true. The author Martin, uses a lot of irony and foreshadowing, could Tyrion killing his father mirror Jamie killing is his possible father the mad king. Idk why I'm writing, I just like sharing. Anyway Night guys. ",10년 전,4,
@tomboone6064,"flipingboredcritic  I was thinking the same and also that Tyrion may be cersei and jamies child. I know they were seperated when they were caught playing when they were young and cersei had said he was hers. idk, they all could be targaryens",10년 전,1,
@coreysmaller,Tom Boone i think that is really stretching it considering Tyrion is about the same age as Cersei and Jamie.,10년 전,1,
@Flippingboredcritic,"Tom Boone yeah idk about the Tyrion, but its possible all three of them could be the Mad King's kids. Makes me curious what Tywin's Wife and the Mad King's relationship was like. Rheagar and Tyrion are both intelligent. So they share the characteristic. But now that I begin to think of it. Both the Mad King and Twyin had arranged marriages that was within their families. Is it possible that Tywin's wife was unhappy about her arranged marriage, like the Mad King was with his?",10년 전,1,
@tomboone6064,"I know it's speculation but I do feel like all 3 or at least Tyrion is from the Mad King.

@Flippingboredcritic,"lukeatus rain well there are differences between the show and books, they may not even show Aegon, like they did with the other IronBorn characters.",10년 전,1,
@lukeatusrain,flipingboredcritic that's my point. they wouldn't skip Aegon VI if he was so important on the whole Targaryen theme. That's why I think he might not be a Targaryen after all.,10년 전,1,
@HausOfSoare,"lukeatus rain dues, aegon died, he was really really old, why are you still discussing it? it is also known from the comics that Tyrion is in fact, targaryen, not getting burns from drogon's fire from the fighting pit scene. also he has had many vivid dreams about dragons and was deeply fascinated with them.... another targaryen trait.... sooo yeah, we already have 2.

@tomboone6064,"Yes the bloodraven doesnt seem like he's leaving from under the tree, it seems like he's actually part of the weirwood. I am not convinced the young Griff is a targaryen or as someone had mentioned he would've been a part of the show as well.",10년 전,1,
@lukeatusrain,"Luciana-Alexandra Soare precisely as some other people said, I was not talking about that Aegon. I was talking about Aegon VI, aka Young Griff, which hasn't appeared on the show so far and it doesn't seem like he will. And Bloodraven is in fact immobilized, but he's a powerful being and is now training Bran to be something powerful too, and keep in mind that Bran is a warg. My theory is that Bran will occupy the third dragon's head, as in he will warg into its mind.",10년 전,0,

Robb married her because he took her virginity and to uphold her honour he had to marry her.

I don't understand why it is so hard to love both? They both have their Pros and Cons (With very little cons might I add). How can someone honestly sit down and say the show is terrible. Yeah you can dislike it but people like this Scooby guy is what gives them a bad rep",10년 전,2,
@EmanVenus,ThatZillaGuy2 Yea...and that's why the people writing the show have so many great books out. There's a reason why GRRM is a world famous author with a great piece of work and the writers of the show are not and do not.  BTW...did you see what happened to True Blood? Descended into pure nonsense because they wanted to go their own way.,10년 전,1,
@EmanVenus,"Trent Edwards It's not an issue of being better than a non-book reader. You usually learn quickly why the author is the author and writers for a TV show are not of that caliber. Sure, the show or movie can be enjoyable but the level of thought that goes into characters and their development - to only be thrown out because the audience likes a particular actor takes away from the strength of the story (and can usually cause plot problems - when a character who was supposed to be dead for example is alive, and now the show's writers have to keep him alive and try to write like the author would - True Blood failed miserably for this reason). Plus there's just so much more information available to the reader of the book. Even when the movie or show follows the book exactly and is a fantastic adaptation, you just can't possibly get every little joke or thought or even understand every situation as well.   ""Tyrion couldn't be more surprised if Aegon the Conqueror himself rode in on a dragon juggling lemon pies"" (when Cersei starts crying suddenly when he came back to be the Hand of the King) - imagine that scene being acted. Needless to say I cracked up reading, and while Peter Dinklage is a great actor, that comedy (like so many other parts of the book) are lost in translation to screen.",10년 전,0,

@Aizen2468,"Scooby dooderino Possibly, but GRRM trusted these guys with the ending to his story.  So.....in all honesty, they know more about his story than pretty much ANYONE else besides GRRM himself.  Now granted, most book purists out there believe they themselves speak for George, and that their opinions are his opinions but....I tend to go with the guys that George himself entrusted the ending of his story to.  If they make changes in the show....then it likely won't have much bearing on the direction then.  Yeah, it'll make for slight detours (Minor plot changes that still bring a character to the same place, or delays of character introductions) or short cuts here and there (Cutting out minor plot points or minor characters, and YES a lot of the characters cut out are minor), but I believe more in them and GRRM's judgment....than I do random fans on the internet who have endlessly complained about the show since the very beginning. ",10년 전,1,

@Aizen2468,"Scooby dooderino yep, but whose to say they aren't following the road just fine though?  If they know the ending, then of course, they're gonna be in a good position to follow the road just fine.  And no person on the planet better knows how well they're following it than George himself, followed by the 2 directors.  Despite how many book purists disagree, George trusts these guys.   And it's kind of silly when a book purist says ""The directors don't know what the hell they're doing!  They're ruining George's masterpiece!"" and then someone responds ""Well....George entrusted them with his ending, so he obviously likes what they're doing."" and then book purists respond in ways like....""Well, George is a sellout, of course he's going to like it when he's being paid so much.""  Sounds mighty hypocritical; like......the book purists are the ONLY ones who knows what's best for the story, even more than George himself.  They make themselves sound worse than they try to make the directors sound.  I've seen that conversation so many times.   Thankfully, you seem slightly different because you both insult the show and praise it at the same time (instead of JUST insulting it).  At least being moderately honest.  But....have some faith in the author whose works you praise, yeah?  Maybe he knows what he's doing ^^",10년 전,1,

@drmouse81,"Aizen2468 I have to say that this is one of the best adaptations of a book I have ever seen. It's very well done, and I congratulate all involved in bringing one of my favourite stories to the screen so expertly.  The main problem I see, which is the cause of other problems, is that they simply cannot include as much detail in the TV series as there is in the books. The Song of Ice and Fire is and immensely complicated series, with incredibly diverse interweaving plot lines. It is impossible for them to include this much in a series of standard format.   This creates issues when it comes to following the story, as some details are missed which are relevant later. They may not be vital for the story, but make it easier to understand. I can't think of any off the top of my head, but I have noticed several throughout. Having read the books, I have been able to explain why characters are acting a particular way when asked by friends who have only watched the series.   Part of me can't figure out how anyone could follow the story at all by just watching the series. When reading the books, I quickly realised I needed to keep flipping back to remind myself of details in order to follow parts of the story. It is one of my favourite epics of all time, but it is definitely not an easy read.",10년 전,0,
