@sadiaislam3522,"For: Exams offer benefits by instilling discipline, as students are indirectly compelled to study consistently and manage their time. The pressure motivates focus and discourages procrastination. Furthermore, exams provide a standardized method to assess understanding, allowing educators to evaluate teaching effectiveness and track student progress against benchmarks. This data informs decisions about academic advancement and targeted support. However, concerns exist. The emphasis on memorization for high marks can overshadow genuine learning and critical thinking. Exam pressure can cause anxiety, hindering performance. Moreover, exams may not fully reflect a student's abilities, testing a limited scope within a time constraint. Alternative assessments like projects and presentations offer a more holistic view of learning and application. In conclusion, the debate is complex. While exams can build discipline and standardize assessment, they can also cause stress and offer an incomplete picture of abilities. A balanced approach, integrating traditional exams with diverse assessments, might be the optimal solution. This could foster deeper learning, reduce anxiety, and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of student progress.",7개월 전,0,

@TakeNoShift,"Yeah I bought a refurbished Dell 3020 SFF for 212 (including tax) and I'm throwing a low profile EVGA 1030 2GB GDDR5 in it that I got for $139 (listed as new on Amazon, hopefully it is). It came with an i5-4590t and 16gb of RAM (which is the max for the mobo). This Wish garbage is a complete ripoff. I'm very new to PC stuff and I'm trying my best to research everything I can and learn as much as possible. When I have the money I wanna do a fresh build, nothing crazy, but I wanna at least get relatively stable 60fps on most games @1080p. My next upgrades on the 3020 would be a better CPU and of course cooling mods to support that. I was thinking maybe i5-4690k with a low profile cooler, and maybe do a kinda janky cutout on the cover above the CPU with a larger fan and swap out the single front fan for something better than the OEM fan that's on it now. I've seen around online that I'd need to maybe do some dremel cutting to make an aftermarket cooler fit though.  Would it be better or more logical to do liquid cooling on the CPU and somehow run the coolant hoses out the case and have the radiator mounted externally somewhere?

@pianotm,"I still use mechanical harddrives. I just built my computer three weeks ago. 60 dollars for a 3 Terabyte Seagate. I could have bought a 2 TB Seagate Barracuda for 55. I was budgeting to the penny, so the Barracuda was the preference, but I went ahead and went with the 3 TB. I got a really sweet Gigabyte z490 UD. put 32 GB of RAM in, but it was cheap and one of the sticks was faulty so it's temporarily running on 16 GB. Put an older refurbished graphics card in. It's the only used component I put in. It's a Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1050, which in spite of being used and older, is doing a fantastic job. Finally, a new i5-10400. I almost got the Ryzen 5. The z490 with the AMD socket was a little cheaper, but I decided to go with i5 since the new ones can handle 128 RAM. Put it all in a 13-year-old Xion case. I know it's old, but this thing is huge and still looks sick. The front panel is DOA, but I installed a new one in the 3.5 floppy slot. I kept the headphones I was using on my old computer because they fucking rock. In spite of the corners I've cut, this thing's running like a rocket. I haven't had to turn down any settings on any of the games I run, and it's running the developer engines I use, Unity 3D and Unreal, smoothly. It also runs Mad Max flawlessly, which I could not run on my old computer without turning the settings all the way down. Prices were not great, anywhere because of the chip shortage (motherboards were, fortunately, not super overpriced, but holy shit, those graphics cards. I think I could have bought an RTX without the chip shortage.).  Also, since I fully intend to always use physical media, even if I download most stuff these days, I installed an LG Blu-Ray reader/writer.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@ReganMarcelis,"Linus - MUST READ: I can tell you what you are doing wrong brother - sorry - not wrong but MISSING.... in your videos, YOU need to produce double the content because I understand you NEED to do the newer stuff for ""some folks"" and the ""dreamers"" out there as well as the sponsors.... If you see this and listen I promise it will work like Tom Brady promised he was the best pick the Patriots had ever chose before he even made the team and was picked barely, last by them out of pity in the 6th and final round, NOW L00K!..... Listen, for every one video or even two videos you make..... (least, even if have to drop talk-show, something else Talk show is purdy good mate?) .......then at least make one for older tech, not super old but older higher end and just ""good stuff"" that mostly everyone is capable of getting their hands on, how to fix it, how to overclock it, the xeons, the x58, x79 (especially) and my new fave the x99 and v3/v4 xeons on all sorts of boards from the old flagships to NEW - heck even single core stuff with a quad duo thrown in once in awhile (oldest I would go) but basically like the Tech Yes City channels of Youtube, the RandomGaming channels of the world and of course be more thorough like the ""known now and loved Steve"" (I called that gamers nexus would be known and loved, so articulate with everything and his people as well as smart but the drive the man has, NEVER STOPS - He was destined and I called it way back when he was still filming from a closet but his heart does NOT QUIT - he does need to get humbled though as in let some stuff slide and not always need passive aggressive revenge I see now that he is larger or it will also be his down-fall and I am being brash, not mean... sincere...because I like STEVE Over-all) ...but anyway, just watch Tech Yes City and Mimic the premise with your face at first, least a year and a half with the switch ready in place long before watching and HECK, you already have so much ""stuff"" there - why not? .....People do not always want to see what is the greatest in benchmarks but rather what is the greatest in benchmarks and unknown as in older x79, x99 or even how the 2500k is doing in 2021 is a video I am waiting for and it will SHOW soon, the only reason I do not watch your stuff anymore is the high end stuff is making you have to do the stuff for the ad's and it does get repetitive but I think your a rock-solid person Linus and go get that money - you feed many mouths and are obviously a good person.... Back to what I was saying; you have to get extra creative and maybe even do stuff that you do not want to always because of the situation, change it yourself with a ""Tech Yes City channel"" heck bring him over to Canada and on the show for a week, how great would that be, if anyone in the WORLD deserves that, Bryan from Tech Yes City does and - NO - I do not know this man nor or we related, etc etc.. I just watch his video and happen to love his style, etc.. So now, I ask you; why can you not have both? .....You can(!) if you decide, heck you can even just have another do it for you on your staff eventually as mentioned on a Linus Tech Tips2 channel, draft somebody NEW who has the HEART, Smarts and face we wanna see that is ""wanting to do it not just for the money but for the LOVE of ""past enthusiast & bargain tech"" etc ..... someone like me but I am obviously not there, if you do go this way I will be awaiting on the sidelines and cheering you on broski from America and maybe one day you can send me a plane ticket over for ""try-out's"" as Linus - it is NOT-OVER just because you had a Vasectomy, hah, was a joke but seriously it is NOT like you seem (it seems) to always think, its just NOT...... unless you keep thinking and preparing for it then maybe it is but what I mean is; it DOES NOT HAVE TO BE! .....Now ""Get-UP""  I DIDN'T HEAR NO bell bud..... Make this your PRIME by being halfway thru NOW not 3/4 or even 7/8's , etc....   -Steve from Philly BTW: Keep being like Trump/Many Others - and do NOT bow down to the ""Big Tech"" as in go against them when its fair to .... like this video - love that! #BeRighteous #BeTheResistance with integrity, we need these folks in the world, you gain as much or MORE then ytou lose when you become this ""guy"".... #Exposer",4년 전,0,

I played Rocket League for 2 and a half years straight and still love it as it is. Rocket League is a Game that wouldn't get you bored if you have fun, time and patience to become a better player. Even without working hard to get better is Rocket League very fun to play. I just wanted to make a point that Rocket League isn't one of those underrated Games.",4년 전,0,

Even if Wish is technically cheaper, you don't ever buy anything off of it unless it's just random crap, like plastic containers, or cable organisers, or other such stuff that won't involve ingestion, applying things to your skin/nails/the like, or electricity. I am probably missing other things you shouldn't do with things from Wish, but that about covers the main stuff. Wish is cheap crap, and in my country, we have discount stores that sell cheap crap like the ones on Wish (they all come from China), so I know what to avoid.

@messiamovsesian2162,"What’s good everybody. I just wanted to spread a lil truth and love.  In the beginning God created everything, and He saw that it was good, for He is the very Source of goodness. He created humans with free will, but unfortunately, we gave into temptation to sin. We as human beings have something called a sinful nature, which means we find pleasure in doing things that are disobedient to God. And getting into Heaven isn’t about if you’re a good or bad person, but it’s whether if you have sincerely asked Jesus to cleanse you from your sins or not. The harsh truth is we deserve eternal punishment in hell for our disobedience towards God, but Jesus (God in human form) lived a perfect and sinless life, died on the cross to pay the payment we owe God, and was resurrected three days after death into Heaven. You can’t be cleansed by your own works (helping out homeless, etc), it’s good to be a good person, but it doesn’t save you from hell. There is no other way into Heaven than by asking Jesus to save you and for mercy and forgiveness. Only by Jesus Christ may you be forgiven and saved for eternity! God can give you a pure heart that you will forever be thankful for. Ask Him to forgive you of your sins and help you to REPENT (to change and turn away from sin, and turn to God), and to transform you and give you a relationship with Him. Just imagine having a personal relationship with the God of the universe. This is an offer that shouldn’t be resisted, we don’t deserve His forgiveness, but He extends it out to us, and He wants to be reconciled with you personally!! Much love ❤️",5년 전,0,

@Bron32," @ancientslav4863  They do have a period of probation, i think Linus mentioned it in one of their warehouse/office cleanup videos. My guess is that it's probably some kind of internal company policy that requires the period of probation, since if a new employee was featured in videos and then the company decided that they weren't happy with their performance, then letting them go would be harder due to members of the audience becoming attached to the new hosts.

Chinese people that I meet are sometimes nice, sometimes impolite or rude. But if anyone is about to quote me on that, Americans are just the same. You can meet someone nice that is very kind and polite. But you can meet someone who maybe, is a serial killer. It just depends on the person. It hardly matters about race or origin. If someone is polite, kind, respectful and more, then they indeed are a good person. If the exact opposite shows in them, then they may be a bad person. Again, if someone is Chinese and reading this, then hey, you are probably a good person! If you’re American and reading this, the hey you’re probably also a good person.

@SamSam-eu8vx,"Hello everyone,  BOYCOTT Wish.com please  On 14 July 2020 at 02:28:30 CEST I bought seven items from Whish.com that cost me 955 SEK ( Swedish Krona).  As you know wish.com never send the purchased order confirmation directly to your email. Instead you could follow your order inside their server at Wish.com.     Two days after, on 16th of July they refund me 8 SEK to my paypal account as one of the item ( 5 SEK value +3 SEK shipping) cancelled by them.     Around 3-4 weeks ago, I noticed one of my item does not even listed in their order list ( somehow they totally deleted that). So basically they took money ( 326 SEK in value) out of 955 SEK for nothing. If I add the current order list items + shipping costs it would be 629 SEK.      I sent them email (As their phone number is just an automatic answering machine)  more than 10 times and they always answer in a childish way and totally unrelated to my questions.  I also should mention that I still did not receive one of the items ( beside of the one that is totally removed from my order list in their website but they charged me for that (326 SEK ) after 2 months)   Do not support them",5년 전,0,

Jesus said, “Whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” If you have done these things, God sees you as a lying, thieving, blasphemous, adulterer at heart, and the Bible warns that one day God will punish you in a terrible place called Hell. But God is not willing that any should perish. Sinners broke God’s Law and Jesus paid their fine. This means that God can legally dismiss their case: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” Then Jesus rose from the dead, defeating death. Today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will give you eternal life as a free gift. Then read the Bible daily and obey it. God will never fail you.",5년 전,0,

@ThePandafriend,"It's insane that Wish is so successful. Even the products which have an okay price are available for lower prices elsewhere. Also I would NEVER buy tech products or in general more complex products meant for the Chinese market. Especially when it's a part of a system which might get damaged by a bad component. The quality control is nonexistent and it is common for products to fail after a year or two. Even if it's an article which also is available in the west. However if you buy the product meant for the western market which actually has a warranty you get a product which went through quality control. That is not true for all products though, for example many of the Chinese tech products available on Amazon don't have any quality control, but depending on the service you can get your money back when the product fails.",5년 전,0,

@estoylaroca,"Def. got scammazed.  We have the ""local"" version of wish (shit still comes from China), and you def. could get the SAME exact pc for about $100. 8gb DDR4 3200 is like $20... goes to like $30 for 2 8gbs when it's on sale. And yes, they're legit ones as well  I don't have any clue about building pc's so I went to a shop to get mine built, and it cost 2x more for the ""parts"" when I bought it in-store, when I could've ordered it online. Though I couldn't really complain since I don't know what parts are compatible if they didn't tell me.  Lastly though, I have the EXACT keyboard and I think the same mousepad. The keyboard I bought for like $4, and the mousepad for $3. The keyboard, though ""cheap"" feeling as it is, is still going strong 6 years later (LOL, this is funny to me because of my mouse), and the mousepad I literally just replaced yesterday since it's already wrinkled. The keyboard thing is funny because I bought a logitech mouse, and only after ONE year of use, the left click is already broken, I can't ""hold"" left click, and it double clicks a lot. Already tried a lot of the ""quick fixes"", but alas I think you'd need actual tools to open up and fix this mouse, which for me is just a hassle. Keyboard's fine, no issues. The only issue would be the wasd's paint has come off from use, but aside from that, it's functioning as any other regular keyboard. Spent $$$ on mouse, it lasts 1 year. Spent pennies on a keyboard and mousepad, will probably only get replaced not because it's broken, but just for the sake of replacing it.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

When you list a product on Wish, you put in the price you want to sell something for. This price though, is not always the price that is shown to the buyer. Wish will seemingly increase your prices randomly without telling you, and pocket the extra profit in addition to their 25% take of whatever the price was that you entered into the listing.  There is also the ""punishment"" fees. If Wish doesn't like something on your listing, and think it is breaking one of their rules, they will fine you up to 500$.  TL;DR Don't buy or sell on Wish.

@22XERO22," @user-cm4op2kz3y  it doesnt matter, they are responsible for what they allow people to sell on their site. They earn part of what you pay, so they are a scam site.

As for the refunds, I bought two items, I didnt recieve the correct items and never got refunded.",5년 전,0,
@user-cm4op2kz3y," @22XERO22  The reason they do not check the items is to keep the prices low, that's common knowledge. It's a site for cheap KNOCKOFF products and even though those things can be advertised like that they have to have a picture of the actual product. Personally I always review the items I receive with a picture attached. But to keep low prices the items come straight from the factory cutting any middlemen and quality control.  But you gotta remember Wish isn't this giant corporation that's just out for your money, they collect tons of vendors mostly from China and they are the ones responsible for the product. If the product or vendor is flagged as a scammer Wish has way of dealing with them. For my case with the refunds Wish gave me my money cause I claimed my purchase didn't go through, they refunded me without even any proof. If a purchase is made the vendor is responsible for the refund and if they don't give it they are a scammer but that can happen at any site, Wish just makes it easier but scammers either get removed or not recommended.",5년 전,0,

I want 500USD(knock off 25% or something like that and you get what it'd be in U.S.A), I also went out of my way to change cooling paste, cmos battery, to blow all the dust out and stress test it a few times, along with resetting it and testing the sshd. Do I get it sold? Nope. Not even anyone interested despite it being the whole kit for such a good price. Just the case and some other parts like the screen would be worth buying it for. I'll probably have to go down to 400-450USD, which kinda sucks because I feel like 500USD is already a good deal. Absolutely refuse to go below 400USD though.

No issue if you can actually return it but the instructions doesn't work in my country so I have to try figuring everything out myself and then pay for shipping myself which tends to be very expensive. We're talking 40-80USD to return a 2.5kg package. I shiver at that price as the stuff I want to return isn't even worth that much most of the time. Nowadays, I just buy things from amazon when I truly can't find any equivalent in my own country or when I'm absolutely positive I won't ever have any real issue with it or if I do, it's their responsibility to fix everything.  The best place to buy parts at is, undoubtedly, reputable stores in your own country.",5년 전,1,

Any fan with more than 7-9 blades and he thinks its weird as if 7-9 blades were the only fan design. Easiest way to look at this is a turbo jet engine on a plane. How many blades on the intake side of the engine... well certainly not the idiotic notion that 7-9 blades is all it should have. My own choice for fans would be the Alseye Flying crab with 11 oddly shaped blades that mimic the hind legs of a crab.

They say the price is this much and then when you go to the checkout the price is more than you were intended buying for and on top of that the quality is s**t. I know some of you might had good experience. But I like AliExpress. They have cheap products and good quality and sometimes directly from manufacturers. And some of the products you can buy in bulk. And most of the items are free shipping. Sometimes it depends, but the shipping isn’t that expensive either.I don’t know about you guys I like AliExpress better when comes to products that are cheap, functional with good quality products that works. Now I am not sure if it is worth building pc from either places, but if you want something cheap and that works then I would say go for it. And Linus you should’ve bought parts from AliExpress to build a PC. And I don’t get it why all YouTubers keep making videos of them buying products from WISH.

My plan: 3600 B450 16 gb 3200 240 nVMe SSD I have 500gb sata ssd in hand I also have 2 x 500 HDD one at 7200rpm and the other at 5400rpm I am going for 1650 super  Is this a good build?

@Dragonblaster1,"Before I realised what Wish.com was. I used them... once. I have a nice Citizen Eco-Drive GPS watch, but what I have always lusted for was their Blue Angels Chronograph, but I don't really like chronographs, added to the fact that they're quite expensive. Not as expensive as the one I own, but they don't do as much. I knew that for the money, I wouldn't be getting a genuine Citizen Eco-Drive Blue Angels, but I thought if it looked as good and kept normal quartz time, it might be worth a punt. But it doesn't really look anything like (it definitely counts as a fake, because it uses the Citizen brand name and apparent features, but they haven't really gone beyond those superficial features). It looks dowdy, and the plain glass will just scuff to buggery in no time.  It's not a true chronograph (the second hand stutters along in little half-second jumps, although sometimes (depends how the buttons are feeling at the time) you can persuade it to move in a smooth chronograph-like movement, it only goes for about forty seconds). It's useless even as a cheap timepiece, and I begrudge the £30 + shipping I paid for it. It's not a sincere, good-looking fake, it's just junk.",5년 전,0,

@Dragonblaster1," @jasonstarrising  When I passed all my school exams at age 18 (damn, that was 39 years ago!), my recently late parents (who never had much money) bought me a BBC Micro Model B 32kb. For me, a tech nerd through and through, they could not possibly have bought me anything in the world more sexily, stunningly, mind-blowingly wonderful. I had genuine tears in my eyes as I hugged them, and I could barely stop sobbing for minutes, and I have never been an emotionally incontinent person. Those things were seriously expensive, and I knew they would have to give up some creature comforts for a while (we never went on a foreign holiday, and in fact, the highlight of a school holiday was day trips to the coast).   It still brings tears to my eyes, as I type this on an MS Surface Book 2 15"". Obviously, they had asked someone at work (they, and later we, worked at British Aerospace Space and Communications Division) what would be a good computer. I learned to code on it and use assembly language, mainly to speed up games at the time (BASIC for the main routines, but machine code for long iterative loops), but later at college I took a unit in coding, and the systems they used ran on Motorola 6502 assembly language: the same as the BBC Micro!  It ended up that instead of turning up every week and writing one program, I would turn up every three weeks and write three programs. I even taught the tutor a few little tricks. I'll tell you something: for 1981, that was some computer, especially for a boy from a poor household like mine.",5년 전,13,

It was somewhat like this one, it would bend and flex if you picked it up wrong, and was not well thought out design wise, so we had to do some quick diy engineering stuffs to get it to work, like cutting out some metal and using spacers and wood screws to get a normal sized 120m fan to fit where it was supposed to in the front, among other things... But for $97, you should get something pretty darn nice, with some nice features, a decent build quality, and like, a warranty and stuff, probably with free shipping within a week or so. From wish, I would have expected something to take 2 months to get here, have little if any english documentation, and to be made out of something along the lines of metal colored paper, BUT also only cost what one would expect to pay for something made out of metal colored paper.  So yeah, he thought it was looking pretty good ""for the price"", until he found out what the REAL price actually was. which is probably in the range of 3 times more than similar quality products on newegg",6년 전,1,

One my friends and my cousin got 128g and 256g cards for their switch but thankfully they didn’t really pay much so it wasn’t a big loss, just an annoyance. I tried to warn them..

Why did the other guy disguise his voice what was the point of that? 2. The fan is smaller, but the blades are at a narrower angle, they provide more air using less movement/space. 3. Bubblewrap protects the stuff from damage during shipment (anyone who uses amazon or online services know exactly how those delivery drivers treat your package) smash the crap out of it. 4. They use copper because copper conducts heat and electricity VERY well compared to other cheap metals, it is very efficient. 5. That is a HUGE heat sink, my god, looks like a mini jet engine. 6. 31$ for a power supply holy shit, i paid 25$ for a 1000 watt EVGA one and it was heavy duty 7. I have a 1060 geforce gtx, obvious knockoff, still have my 1060, looks nothing a like. Damn china. 8. R.I.P power supply  All in all you did a great job on the video, but never should anyone use wish, i built a pc 5 times better than this for 450$ on newegg not long ago.

@Insomniac_Hart,"Regular stores teach customers about the products they are interested in or have. This includes Brands and model numbers of these brands. They do sell pirated versions because they too are looking for a profit. ( Mad Catz ) they just make sure it works before they do.   Once the consumer knows the difference between products and the expected quality of them? Its easier to get better deals and/or spot fakes, or pirated/ repaired products! You can notice mistakes super easily if you know what products are, how they're packed, Reflective Anti-Piracy stickers, Etc. Then every fake product will be as recognizable as a fake pair of ""Nikee's"" or ""Robo-coup Pirate Princes adventure motorcycle "" Action figures.    I've had an Xbox one I got in an alley, for two years and it still works fine.  My friend got me a cool Sound base/bar from BOSS that makes my crappy TV sound like a booming surround sound system thing from the streets and it too also works Fine.  WISH has discounted products because NONE of them are OEM (Original Equipment Manufacture ) They are like Mad-Catz Inc. knock off versions of the original.   I obtained a charger for my Nintendo DS, lol its twice as light as the original, and it has no Nintendo logo. lol. I feel it was made from recycled materials.  On wish? If it is a real brand name product? You'll notice the price is the same as the store, BUT if the price is lower? For a Name brand product?

I'm not saying there aren't cases out there that are stronger than others but, if you hit ANY case with a hammer will it not dent? I know that's an extreme example but, then the IO on the case he had was obviously thin aluminum. so in comparison the hammer example on a more sturdy case is kind of relevant. My whole point was, he bought these parts off of wish (paid more for them than buying off of Ebay) knowing they are not going to be high quality and he's surprised when he's holding the case by the IO out stretched and the IO bends? I'm surprised more things didn't break the way he was tossing them around. lol.

@xPreatorianx1,"There's bubble wrapping because USPS is allowed to throw packages in their office. That's right folks. Carriers can't throw packages during delivery. But when clerks sort them, they literally throw them into bins that are marked for the route. It's the only approved throwing that occurs in the post office. <---USPS employee. So if you ever get a damaged package from USPS, blame the clerks. It happens, I'm a trainee who has witnessed it. It literally becomes a game to them. Personally, I found it appalling. They setup at the station and have all the routes laid out in bins. They scan the product, it tells them what route it goes to. Then they throw it in the bin.   Note: I could be wrong on the job title of those who throw packages. I assume they are clerks because besides the supervisors/post master, they run shit. (They literally have to know every street/house number that their post office serves. Seriously these people are underpaid and underappreciated by not only the post office but the customers. FYI, I'm a rural carrier. So I'm not a clerk bitching about his job.)   Plus I'm only 3 days into On The Job training. So I could easily be passing blame off to the clerks when the real culprits are of a different job title. But again, it does happen, it's standard practice, and it's appalling. This is just one example of the post office that you learn how little they give a fuck, through actual employment, about the products you buy. Pray you don't ship a laptop through USPS. As it too, will probably meet the same fate. As laptops are weighing less and less as the years progress. So if you can throw it, chances are it will be thrown. So again, pray the manufacturer included a shit load of packing material. Otherwise? You might just end up with a DOA product because some asshat threw your $500 to $2000 product. (AND GOT PAID TO DO SO!) Because that's how they were trained.  (Honestly if consumers knew the shit that happened behind the scenes at their local post office, the post office wouldn't exist.)   We are literally trained to care as little for the mail as possible, while regulations/laws dictate we have to treat it like gold. So every step of the way it's counterproductive. You are literally trained to handle the mail as gold. (Academy training, not on the job training) But the truth of the matter is, as usual, training and real life rarely correspond with each other. There's training and there's actual real world application. Those court documents you need in pristine condition? Yup, we folded them to fit in our case. (A shelf divided by metal sheets for each mail box/address.) That package you paid your hard earned money for? Someone threw it like it was a ball landing in a basket ball hoop.

@Insomniac_Hart,"Not everyone in a Dark Alley has garbage you know! It has to do with What you know... So... Here's how it is!  Regular stores teach customers about the products they are interested in or have. This includes Brands and model numbers of these brands. They do sell pirated versions because they too are looking for a profit. ( Mad Catz ) they just make sure it works before they do.   Once the consumer knows the difference between products and the expected quality of them? Its easier to get better deals and/or spot fakes, or pirated/ repaired products! You can notice mistakes super easily if you know what products are, how they're packed, Reflective Anti-Piracy stickers, Etc. Then every fake product will be as recognizable as a fake pair of ""Nikee's"" or ""Robo-coup Pirate Princes adventure motorcycle "" Action figures.    I've had an Xbox one I got in an alley, for two years and it still works fine.  My friend got me a cool BOSS Sound base/bar from the streets that makes my crappy TV sound like a booming surround sound system thing and it too also works Fine.  WISH has discounted products because NONE of them are OEM (Original Equipment Manufacture ) They are like Mad-Catz Inc. knock off versions of the original.   I obtained a charger for my Nintendo DS, lol its twice as light as the original, and it has no Nintendo logo on it. lol. I feel it was made from recycled materials.  On wish? If it is a real brand name product? You'll notice the price is the same as the store, BUT if the price is lower? For a Name brand product? Odds are even if it is OEM, its probably a returned remanufactured/ rebuilt product.",6년 전(수정됨),6,

@c.twentytube,"kind sir may I please have any random tech gadgets that you no longer have a need for? I am a lifelong tech lover which is why I have been a long-time fan/subscriber of yours and always look forward to checking out all the creative, entertaining,and highly informative content you create. Unfortunately for as huge as my passion for tech goes I am equally as empoverished and have not been able to afford many gadgets throughout my life. I remember asking for a computer one year for Christmas and I actually did get one,my first and last computer ive personally owned which was a Commodore 64 that hooked up to an old black and white tv my family had. Mind you i am in my 20s now,so yeah that tech was just a smidge outdated to say least but I loved it anyhow cuz it was TECH and it somehow despite it being as pitiful and feature-LACKED as any pc possibly could be it still somehow managed to spark an everlasting affection for all things tech 💓💓💓💓. i just wish i was able to afford any of those very things that I truly enjoy learning about through tech news outlets such as your youtube channel. But anyways buddy please keep me in mind if ever have anything laying around that you wouldnt mind parting with and I wish you much continued success and for you and all your loved ones to have all the happiness that life has to offer! 🙂🤗 Take care God bless 😇🙏",6년 전,0,

@Meton12765,"What the hell do you mean ""if something seems too good to be true, it probably isn't"", none of those fucking prices make any sense on Wish*com, most of the time they sell what you just assembled with the prices you quoted as the products you got. The only thing that adage applies to is the GPU. But, for example the case and many others like it are being sold for the price you paid and advertised appropriately and you can see from the shitty pictures that they're nothing appealing. What makes this doubly fucked up is that you can buy a Fractal Design R5 / R6 for the money you paid for a pile of worthless tin that deforms if you look at it funny. And Fractal Design isn't even a good example, 97USD buys fuck ton of good PC case from any semi-reputable computer parts store in a western nation even with ridiculous tariffs imposed. Cases you can go and look at and touch first in an actual store and then buy the exact same thing in a sealed box from the counter next to them. And if you're too tired to do that, those same stores have their own webstores from where you can have something delivered  sight-un-seen but knowing it's from a reputable manufacturer, like Corsair, Rosewill, ThermalTake... Fuck, you name it. For that price. Same goes for every other component in the build, and even if it's cheap noname chinese crap it's something someone has looked over and tested enough that it works for the price point for a western market so they don't receive product returns wrapped in plastic explosives and/or a line of angry customers in front of their store. And still they manage to take home decent slice of profit, even WITH the ridiculous taxation. You need to be a complete imbecile to buy any of this from wish*com. Especially when you can find better deals on cheap chinese tat on aliexpress, dx, amazon, fucking yet again there's a long list of better places to shop around for crap you don't need. Nevermind the certified preowned office machines you can have for less than 150USD from places which recycle old lend lease machines....

@derekgalbraith1508," @NaoVII  I don't know what the quality of the hoodie is like because I've never been able to examine one in person, but my point wasn't that it isn't a quality product. I'm willing to bet that, as far as hoodies go, it's of good quality. My point is just that $60 is out of my price range for what I would spend on something like a hoodie. It's an item of casual wear. You can get good quality casual wear much cheaper as long as you don't care about the branding.  I buy hoodies here in the UK for £18 which are great quality, fit well, are comfortable etc.  Sure, I can understand paying a small premium to support your favourite CPU dropper, but not that much of a premium.  And, before anyone complains about that sentiment, I'm not saying the premium on these hoodies is sheer profiteering either. I don't know the markup on them. The percentage markup may be quite reasonable. It may be the case that a large chunk of the difference in price between the hoodies I buy and the LTT hoodie is down to economies of scale - the place I'm buying from may be manufacturing and selling in much higher quantities which reduces per unit prices. But that still doesn't make me want to spend more than I have to. I could get one hoodie with an LTT logo on it, or for the same price I could get 3 unbranded hoodies. Given that the unbranded ones are still good quality, there's really no contest.",6년 전,3,

Wish just seems to be a pretty bad place to buy parts in general. For $360 USD you can pick up an old 3rd or 4th gen i5 based business desktop off lease and upgrade the power supply, add a decent gpu and a SSD and sometimes you can even find 2nd or 3rd gen i7s and even some 1st gen extreme i7 based rigs and upgrade them for the same or slightly more and have something very solid. Just the other day, I saw a old Alienware area 51 with a i7 965 extreme in it, a GTX 470 and 12GB of ram for $350 shipped. I'd offer maybe $300 for it but even at $350, it isn't a terrible deal but you can do better. That said, since that Alienware looked like it used an Asus motherboard, you could pick up a super cheap Xeon X5650 for $10~15 and have a really solid 6c/12t machine to build on and flip the i7 965 for about $30~35.",6년 전,0,

@CrazyRespawn,That gpu is likely a 450 or 460. And it's also falsely reading it's memory count. It might say it's a 4gb or 6gb but is only 1gb. If you play a game that uses more that 1gb or gets higher than 1gb the game will freeze because the system tries to use the 4gb but cant. The reason it thinks it's a 1050 is because it's been flashed with a custom firmware. You can reflash it but you need a chip flashing kit and another custom firmware found online. But why would you when a 450 to 460 card can be picked up cheaper than these cards. Ps if you actually count the memory chips on the board you will see what I mean with the memory issues.,6년 전(수정됨),3,

AliExpress doesn't control anything, it just facilitates a platform for conducting this kind of business.  Maybe in the future you'll learn a tad more about stuff before you spout off with things like ""In fact, it is a scam"" - because no, it's not.

@LimDul,The reason everything detects the GPU incorrectly is because they modded the GPU BIOS. It's not that hard to do on older cards. I used to do that in the early 2000s on my Hercules/Guillemot 3D Prophet II GTS Pro (GeForce2 series) since it was literally identical to the Ultra version hardware-wise but soft-locked to lower frequencies. Flashing the Ultra BIOS was so much easier and more reliable than using some kind of overclocking software and still have it being identified as a GTS Pro. Weird name for that card by the way since the GTS and Pro models were supposed to be different things on paper but perhaps that's why it could be modified to Ultra specs so easily. Maybe this was not the case for other manufacturers - I don't remember. I think I still have that card lying around somewhere for nostalgia's sake. :),6년 전(수정됨),0,

I've recently bought one (needed a graphics card with about the performance of a 450 and didn't really care what i got) and in the end won the dispute. But the seller keeps on selling these fake cards, even though throughout the dispute process (including escalations) it became very clear that the seller was very much aware of the scam he was pulling, but just didn't care.",6년 전,1,

Then there are moments when he is holding the case up close to him and the camera is shot over his shoulder, his head is in focus but the case which is close to him and the subject of what he is talking about is out of focus.
