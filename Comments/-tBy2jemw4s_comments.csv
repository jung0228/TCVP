When our family went to Vegas when I was around 9 years old I saw an entire section of the casino filled with Pachinko machines, and I played them while my parents were off playing the slots - and no one at the casino stopped me. I loved it, and got hooked! Soon I'll be moving to Vegas, and am looking forward to playing Pachinko again - though sadly it's only found in a few casinos there now.",1년 전,0,

But, as expected by society, getting it out of your system & going straight by your late twenties. Or, going big on festivals & letting off because daily life is so rigid. Or, how their music keeps telling young people to be kind, forgiving & to believe in people. This form of gambling ""lite"" fills the niche of hard gambling that's seen as destructive & legislated as illegal.  Japanese society, as a whole, have a very vague understanding of these self-regulation, but don't ever seem to put it into words. Same as the French, they find it very complicated to put it into words & your just expected to comprehend it -- ""makes sense?"". Sorta like taboos that are not spoken, but there are nothing wrong with these self-regulations.  When society stresses itself a lot & work hard with much discipline, quirks & urges crop up (such as gambling because of office pressure). Unless the society falls apart, they find ways to let off. Like how Germans are very strict, but when the  company goes out for a drink or when it's Oktoberfest, they really let off.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@Nypolice2," @qwerty49424  it's the fact you can get good and how You can manipulate the statistical alignments of the balls. Give a much higher output of the outcome you desire the louder the bing on a certain point. The angle of attack of a certain ping sound is what you look for. It's learning the different pitches of the sound Bing, Bing m********* it is the absolute artistry, a sound of the angles in which it hits resonating to your ears, the people having their little celebration when you have a win, the atmosphere, the sound, the alcohol. It's just fantastic. It's the array of joy of the people around you. If the atmosphere the smell of the automatic dispenser that goes off giving you that incense smell it's so much more than a game.

We didn’t have lots of money either so it seems rather frivolous in hindsight. Anyway, it was easily the least played toy we ever got. There’s no real skill to it or strategy behind playing it. Plus it’s a solo endeavor so yeah … it was quickly relegated to a back room where it sat for years until I sold it via eBay about 5 years ago for something like $100.",2년 전,0,

@Darkstar.....,dam Natski. you nailed that explanation on gambling. Iv never been a gambler and until now never understood. I thought it was purely about the money in a greedy way. so that's why people lose more than they win but still go back again. Somewhere in there minds of common sense they know they aren't there to win. they are bored to death but on the surface they believe they are going to each day to win and that's what threw me off. can't they see losing is what has been the predominant trend.,3년 전,0,
@RemnantCult,"I feel like Pachinko parlors are in between prize arcades and actual casino gambling. The small pachislot place they were in is more focused on fun and getting prizes while those huge multistory places are ran with the purpose of hooking people to their machines to try their luck for hours at a time. It can certainly be a fun time but I feel that there needs to be a newer type of pachinko that's more skill based for that fun factor to still be there. Gambling is fun in small spurts but getting hooked is obviously terrible. Overall, I have mixed feelings for it but I can't be a hypocrite because I enjoy prize arcades.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

@killerdustbunny3205,Same…. I still don’t know how his domain works lmao,3년 전,1,
@guilha1506," @killerdustbunny3205   Let me explain    His domain is divided in two fases, the initial one where he builds up hype and the events, where he has the chance to hit a jackpot   In the initial fase he can use 3 indicators that the event is coming, the balls, the doors and the multipliers. The balls and doors are divided in four colors (green, red, golden and rainbow), the better the color the higher is the hype, with golden having 80% and rainbow 100% (he can only get rainbow in his forth try)  The hype is the chances of hitting a jackpot during the event (normally the chances are 1/239, but it can increase to even 80%). During the event he calls for a Reach (when a player gets two equal numbers) and hopes for getting the third one, the events are represented by a little movie that plays on the background, if everything in the movie goes right he gets it   Now, in the new chapter we saw the next form of his domain, the Change of Chances. When he hits a jackpot he has two choices for his next domain, he can go to Faster Spins, that makes the events happen faster, or go to the increased probability, where he can activate pseudo-spins, that are rolling just one of the numbers untill he gets what he wants, he basically forces a Jackpot.   Since the Change of Chances has a high chance of Jackpot he can use his third indicator, the multipliers, they build up less hype, but they can somehow rewind time (we see Kashimo defeating him two times, but he breaks the “glass” and go back unharmed)",3년 전(수정됨),18,

Flippers changed them into obvious games of skill (rather than the much more subtle skill demonstrated in this video), and led to them being legal again.

Pachinko is different because the prizes are worth more and the place is literally about gambling your arcade currency for more arcade currency.  Then exchange it for something with monetary value.  All the arcades I've been to have like weird old stuff at the prize counters, although they do have mugs and drinking glasses that are probably the thing you wanna go for.

It's so funny how you almost become a different person when learning a new language (within the use of that new language).

What happens is that the coupon is a kind of certificate of how many balls you own. Then you go to the different building and ""sell them your share"", basically saying that the balls are entrusted to the pachinko place. Then, the company that bought your balls sells them back to the pachinko for convenience, since they already hold the balls for you anyway. This way, there is no cash transaction between the pachinko and you so it is not gambling. I don't know if it's accurate, I think I read that in a magazine a long time ago.",4년 전,0,

I would argue that it even can be detrimental, because all gamblers care about is the constant rattling of incoming bearings, which are only worth 25% of their usual value, forgetting in due time how much weight they put in to begin with.

@PlutozReal," @lhb82  when you see hoof prints do you automatically think zebra? Just use logical reasoning and the conclusion is this. Scientists at the Wuhan lab were studying a strain of coranavirus found in bats from a nearby cave. As part of their research they altered the virus to survive better in lab conditions and probably studying the likelihood of it jumping species, added components to help it along. Which explains why the virus hopped species so effectively with out the delay that usually occurs when virus jump species. Then once the animals died they probably instructed some lab tech to incinerate the animals. That probably poorly compensated assistant then probably decided to make a quick buck and sell them at the exotic meat market. Cross contamination probably resulted in the virus spreading to different animals leading to the initial confusion about which animals it came from. Its a plausible and likely option for what happened. At this point you're never going to know the whole truth so ""plausible"" and ""likely"" are good enough. But the notion that it started somewhere else entirely, you're lying to yourself.",4년 전,7,
@ev6558," @khi9395  There's no data which proves that it was created in a Chinese lab. ALL the current evidence points to the origin being in China. China tried to cover it up, and then as soon as it started becoming clear that the origin was within China they immediately made a completely baseless accusation that it started in the US instead, like a child screaming ""NO, YOU'RE THE POOPYHEAD!"" Go back to Weibo with your propaganda.",4년 전(수정됨),4,
@PlutozReal," @ev6558  it wasn't created in a Chinese lab but it was altered in one. There's a spike protein on the virus that is rare in naturally evolved viruses and helps it be especially effective at infecting human cells. Its also why they were able to make a vaccine so fast. Since the protein is not naturally evolved on the virus, the protein is more stable, allowing it to be targeted with a vaccine.   Out of all the bats, out of all the meat markets, out of all the cities in China, this one infected people in a city that also has a major government viral research lab. There is no possible way that is a coincidence. It'd be like if a global pandemic causing virus started in Atlanta, Georgia where all the offices of the CDC are headquartered, including the National Center for Emerging Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, and when questioned the CDC said ""we didn't do it"".

So while at a casino you can have swings of 100's of dollars, in this it is more like swings of 10's, making it much easier to play long term.

@KM-dw9hc,"Although their service is great, unfortunately almost of Japanese wish Pachinko disappear. One reason is they own too many stores in contrast to number of their customers. And they are located in very accessible places such as close to the train station and are very vast. The total area of pachinko parlors nationwide will be large enough to make about 10,000 soccer fields. There are about 10,000 pachinko parlors in Japan. This is too much for leisure facilities. Since there are 4,000 amusement arcades and 2,000 karaoke stores, it is clear that the number of stores is abnormal compared to these.And it is said that the number of pachinko users is about 10 million a year. However, this statistic includes the population who has used it only once a year. The average annual number of users per store is 1000 at most. There are only a few thousand people in a store per year. To put it more clearly, only two or three people use it a day. The average number of units installed per store is 66, so you can see how huge this number is. However, pachinko parlors spend an average of about 20 million dollars per user per store, and their sales are 35 thousand dollars, which means that at least 16,5thousand dollars per person is reduced. The average annual income of Japanese is about 44thousand dollars, so you can see how big a loss this is. Of course, there is a return, so not everyone is in such an unfortunate situation, but pachinko is a natural play to lose. Who needs 10,000 such facilities? Many Japanese prefer instead to build meaningful facilities such as parks and nurseries.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@diego0086,"The basic nature of gambling—winning money at the expense of others—is at odds with the Bible’s warning to “guard against every sort of greed.” (Luke 12:15) Gambling is, in fact, fueled by greed. Gaming institutions advertise big jackpots, while downplaying the poor odds of winning, because they know that dreams of wealth prompt players to wager large amounts at the casinos. Rather than helping a person guard against greed, gambling promotes the desire for easy money.  Gambling is based on an inherently selfish goal: winning money that other players have lost. However, the Bible encourages a person to “keep seeking, not his own advantage, but that of the other person.” (1 Corinthians 10:24) And one of the Ten Commandments states: “You must not desire . . . anything that belongs to your fellow man.” (Exodus 20:17) When a gambler sets his heart on winning, he is, in essence, hoping that others will lose their money in order for him to profit.",5년 전,1,

@nunyabusiness896,"I played a vintage pachinko machine at a friend's house about 15 or so years ago (his dad had one for some reason, it was basically an antique) and it was a basic pinball-like experience with the mechanical lever to launch the balls like one of the earlier machines in this video.   When I went to Japan recently, I was like ""oh yeah, pachinko! I've played that, let's see what it's like in Japan nowadays"" and holy god what a fever dream nightmare it has become.  It's gone from an endearing simple Plinko Pinball to an unbelievably loud epilepsy fit of flashing lights with a video game going on in a TV screen that makes absolutely no sense.  I played a Biohazard one (Resident Evil's name in Japan) and it kept doing some kind of slot machine thing with numbers and then a monster would come out and I was supposed to tap a button or something but everything was in Japanese and I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to do.   Even if I had found I was good and could always come out on top winnings-wise I still don't think I could stand going into those parlors because of the obscene noise and smoke clouds from the chain smokers that frequent them.   If anyone knows of a place in Japan that only runs the vintage machines that are quieter, let me know as I really don't care to play the modern ones ever again.",6년 전,0,

Even though its hard to catch someone red-handed at their first attempt, the store would have notice something is wrong when its closed. Small stores would have staffs watching over players while bigger stores will have markings on their balls. Even though there won't be any over the top apprehending or arrest happening when a store know there's something wrong, hundreds of CCTV in the store would have took pictures of the offender and shared it with stores around the area and within its own chain store.

Why there are so many pachinko parlors are located in the best commercial area?

We did not know what this thing was. But the noise and people really got use going.  Between the four of us, we won a considerable amount of tickets. Which was the way they paid out in the old days? We followed this guy around the corner to cash it out winnings and it kind of started going sideways because of the amounts.

The noise don't bother me and I haven't seen a place that dosn't allow smoking.

What gets me are the one with all them buttons and flashing lights that say hit now or smash button as fast as you can ect ... they all do exactly nothing, none of them do anything what so ever for game play.

When I went in July I tried to go to different Pachinko places but it was always too loud and smoky to the point where I couldn't hear anything but the machines and feel suffocated because of the smoke. This concept is great for people who can't stand that and want to play the game. I love it! I also get the concept of trying one's luck. They had One piece day at 7elevn and I did a drawing for a prize (you pay $6 and get a scratch off). I won a figure and a cup on my first try!

@hydra4251,Gambling addiction is just like any other addiction – It’s a drug. Gambling is rigged to hook you in. The odds of you winning are greater when you first start playing. Winning gives you endorphins. It makes you want to keep playing on – until you’ve lost all your money.,6년 전,5,

@ClasherofWorlds,"FeanorBR well people don't spend hundreds and thousands of dollars also I can't say for loot boxes but in gacha systems in mobile games, gacha systems are either 100% random which can be exploited or on a track meaning that the rolls themselves aren't based on luck but pre determined by the game so you're bound to get something good such as an uber in battle cats",6년 전,0,

@HylianPirate278,"Johnny Sack it doesn’t just apply to gambling, another example is if you paid for a movie, realized it was total shit a third of the way through, but still sat through the rest of it instead of walking out of the theater because you think you’d have wasted your money if you didn’t finish it, even though you’ve already wasted your money by buying a ticket to a bad movie.",6년 전,4,

I'm just about to go to Uni, my degree is English (but I'm considering switching to Linguistics, or just Education in general, I'd love your input on that if you have any opinions). I know you're living in Japan permanently, how did you go about doing that? I'm most likely going to try the JET program but I know their program only lasts 3 years, tops. What route would you suggest for someone who's intending to have a prolonged, permanent career teaching English in Japan?  Would it be best for me to start with the JET program, stay out there for 3 years, return to the US (my home country) and then look for a permanent position? Or is there a way to bypass that, to your knowledge?  Sorry for the long comment! I don't expect you to be an expert on this but I figure your experience is pretty close to what I want mine to be, so it was worth a shot.

Can you comment on how you figured out ""life""/""doing life""/having a social life in Japan?

@Panic_,"After 10 long years of wishing, I finally started a 3 week vacation about 2 weeks ago in Tokyo (traveling around with the JR pass), and I noticed these places around or near all the major (and sometimes not so major) train stations. I entered one and was immediately confused; it looked like a casino; one that, on the contrary to what we have in the Netherlands, was really easy to access. I was bewildered and confused by all the noise, both digital and of metal ball bearings, and noticed the cigarette smell almost right after. It was too much to take in so I looked around a little and decided it wasn't an arcade or something, so I left again. This video gave me a lot of insight on these places, and if it really only costs 500 yen to buy in, I might try it before I return home (which I really don't want to haha). Currently still in Tokyo until Friday.. I'll definitely return next year for a 4 week vacation instead of 3!  Also, quality production!

@TomLee777,"Great video, I currently work in the Pachinko industry (and have been for over 10years) as an on-air talent. There are so many things which are ""not to be spoken"" of when it comes to Pachinko. It is actually illegal for someone working in the industry to say how much money they won, so we have to always refer to winnings as the number of balls or coins in the case of Pachislot (Pachinko's slot-like sibling). Balls are rented for 4yen or 1yen, but only have a value closer to 80-90% of that when you want to give them back. This is called the 換金ギャップ KANKIN GAP, and is where alot of Pachinko parlors make their money. 1yen pachinko tends to have a bigger gap, so despite being more accessible to play due to being cheaper it is actually harder to get your stake back.  I used to work at one of the biggest Pachinko TV program companies till 2017, now I do my own videos on YouTube and stream my Pachinko adventues on Twitch as well. I am famous for being the person to lose the most money in one day on TV, that was 172,500yen. The most I've won is 16,000 coins, each coin is rented for 20yen...  If you want to know more, and even gain permission to film in a larger Pachinko parlor, and perhaps open up the Pachinko world to the West more, I'd be more than happy to help.",7년 전,686,

I am a complete moron and have been offered 4 jobs in 5 interviews, and three of those were pushing the contract across the table before I'd even finished thinking about it. You may have heard of the difficult-to-get-on JET Programme, ALT work is basically the same, but with about half the pay and no support. You can still do alright if you are careful, though. (and look for second jobs on Saturdays and evenings at ""Eikaiwa"", small private schools which are literally everywhere). The hardest parts are banking, housing and local government stuff (the pension system etc), but in cities and big offices there'll probably be an English speaker in there somewhere. Leo Palace readily rent flats to foreigners, they're overpriced for what you get, but depending on where you come from can still seem incredibly cheap. Their English website is full of lies, though.

@justsomeit5818,"While your video (made from the view point of a complete novice) was excellent you left some things out.  I am an American and I have lived in Japan for about 13 years.  I play pachinko regularly, at least 3-4 times a week.  You missed a few items, first it's not a ticket that you exchange for money.  You take the ticket to the front counter and exchange it for a gift. You can chose an actual luxury item like perfume, watches, toys, etc.. But most people opt for the ""Collectible chips""  These chips have some item in-cased in color coded plastic (Yellow = 200y Green= 1000Y, Red= 5000Y. )  These are what you trade at an off site booth/window called a ""collectibles shop""  This is how they get around the laws.  And it's not about skillfully placing the balls in the slots anymore, the game boards are setup to make it so about 15-20 balls for every 250 hit the start hole.  To be a true professional you need to be something of a math wizard.  Every game has a stat counter above it.  This display has everything from averages to the amount of start per win etc... You need to understand the average of the game you are playing and the parlors history of payouts.  With this info you can make an educated guess on which machine is going to be set at a higher payout percentage.  It took me years to get fairly good at picking machines but I still lose more then I win.  And the true pros play Pachi-slots not pachinko.  Pachi-slots get pretty complicated with all the stats but, the payouts can be easily 200,000Y+ .",7년 전(수정됨),1,

@upinarms79,"As much as I respect Japanese culture, I will never understand the draw to pachinko.  I guess it's kind of like pinball...  and I love pinball... but pachinko just seems like some kind of ADHD version of pinball combined with cheap slot machine mechanics that addicts people much the same way slots do.  There's just so much random crap going on at one time on a pachinko machine that I think it'd drive me nuts having to sit in one of those parlors for too long.  I dunno...  I guess the draw is kind of like nickel slots in Vegas where you get to play a whole lot for little risk and might win some small jackpot if you play long enough.  I supposed at a price of around one dollar for 100 balls, you're not risking much, but I see videos of Japanese people literally feeding these things thousands of balls at a go and can only think that it can't be a healthy obsession.",7년 전,29,

Even at thousands of balls I don't see that as terrible.  At one yen it's simply .9 pennies per ball.  I don't see this as being a generally unaffordable hobby/past time. With that said, anyone can make something look bad without moderation.",7년 전(수정됨),1,
@upinarms79,"Well, 100 balls for a dollar was a rough estimation, close enough at 9/10s.  Yeah, the problem is most of the time when you see people playing in these parlors they literally have stacks and stacks of hundreds of thousands of balls they're feeding these things and do so for hours on end.  It's just one of those things that makes the government a lot of money from taxes so they turn a blind eye to it, kind of the same as tobacco, booze, and lottery tickets in much of the US.  A lot of people don't like it, but they ain't gonna say no when it keeps bringing in that so much money.  I'm not saying it should be banned or that it's immoral (though it probably could be in the case of addiction) or any such thing as that... it's just an amusing observation to me, especially when some foreigners like to pretend that Japan is somehow this pristine land that is above such ""profligacy"".  There's no such petty problems in GLORIOUS NIPPON like in the US.",7년 전,0,
@ReticentLily,"It's like early pinball, nothing like flipper pinball though. Maybe I'm a bit biased, but it's really not a good comparison at all. Pinball has evolved over the years into a competitive, skill-based game, although it's niche due to arcades falling off in the west. Pachinko has some skill involved with launching the ball, but there's nothing you can do after that outside of what it restricts you to. It's evolved more into a game focused mostly on luck rather then skill, using minigames and a slight element of skill to keep it more interactive then say, slots.",7년 전,0,

You claim to upload weekly and then don't upload in over a month. Also, whenever you didn't upload in over a month, you tend to upload a video explaining why there was a break, instead of simply giving quick and timely updates on instagram or twitter. I can recall an instagram picture of yours where you said weekly uploads were gonna follow after you release natsuki - the movie. the next video you uploaded came out one and a half months after said post. It'd be nice if you kept us updated more frequently through other media (twitter, instagram, etc.). Other than that: keep up the great work!

@LaptopNewbie,"This was very good! Natsuki is very charismatic!! Very respectful exploration of topic. When I went to Japan, I never did enter a pachinko parlor but I could hear the deafening and chaotic sounds whenever someone entered or left. Contrary to what I thought, pachinko seems much more affordable to play than arcade games at Sega or Taito Station since each try is 100 yen and winning is also very luck based, especially for beginners. Next time, I will definitely try it, and the ones where you get prizes rather than cash back seem promising. Thanks for all these awesome videos!

My mum and I went to Japan two years ago after I graduated high school, and out of curiosity visited one of these pachinko parlours whilst we were in Hiroshima . It was so bloody loud!

We also visited Takayama, as you did in this video. I didn’t know I’d like the more rural side of Japan, but it ended up being my favourite place; we were able to experience Japan more through this town, as it was not as manic as other parts of the country and holds a lot of history. It’s also full of hidden gems (like much of Japan is) as we also came across a historical teddy bear museum/cafe on our way back from the Takayama Historical Folk Village, which was odd but interesting😂",7년 전(수정됨),0,

Don't get me wrong, I like the way you handled the video, but just like most of Japan's social problems, I think how damaging pachinko machines are to Japanese society gets really downplayed by the government. The entire demographic of these machines is aimed at robbing elderly people of their money through some addictive mindless feedback loop, and I don't think portraying this is as some cool thing to try is really a good idea. Not that I think foreigners are going to come and get hooked on pachinko. That would actually be mildly hilarious.

@amanofnoreputation2164,"The need for gambling is readily understood, I think the Japanese have a unique outlook on it as a result of being more accepting of circumstances beyond their control.   A westerner sees little value in a game he does not stand to win. It is only his lesser nature that tempts him into throwing his money away. It is as though he feels that the expenditure of his time and effort does not simply contribute to, but entitles him to victory.   But the Japanese person goes into the experience knowing that most of the balls will whizz  senselessly past their target into the abyss, and for that reason the unexpected victory for which they were never entitled is all the more deserved.  Skinner boxes are only slightly more common in Japanese video games than western, by my estimation at least, but they are presented in ways almost completely contrary to one another.  In western games, chance generally represents realism: the capacity for things to go wrong in unpredictable ways. But in Japanese video games, chance generally represents fantasy: the capacity for things to right in unpredictable ways.  In the west, chance is an obstacle between honest work and success.  In Japan, the obstacle is accepted humbly as a given, and anything bestowed beyond that by chance is a gift.",7년 전,0,

@sirrliv,"I have to say Chris, I actually really liked this more history lesson style of video. I'd heard bits and bobs about pachinko and its roundabout form of gambling, but never anything about the history behind it. In fact, learning about Japan's cultural history beyond the broad strokes is rather difficult from the wrong side of the Pacific. If the opportunity arises, I'd love to see more videos like this on your channel, learning more about Japan's modern past from an insider's perspective.  One place I've heard of that I might suggest looking into would be the Meiji Mura Architectural Museum in Inuyama, near Nagoya. This outdoor museum features the largest collection of surviving buildings from the Meiji and Taisho Eras (1867-1926) anywhere in Japan, including the lobby from Tokyo's famous Imperial Hotel designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, and yes, an original Meiji Era sake brewery (don't recall if it's still operational or not).   Also on display are one of the first electric trams to operate in Kyoto, dating from 1912, and a pair of 19th Century steam locomotives, one of which, No. 12, was built in 1874 as No. 23 for the first Kobe-Osaka-Kyoto Railway and is a copy of two of the first steam engines to operate in Japan full stop, on the Shinbashi-Yokohama Line in 1872; these engines, built by Sharp-Stewart of England, were part of an order of 10 such locomotives ordered from 5 different British builders. The Sharp-Stewart engines in particular were considered the most successful of the bunch, so when the time came to order locomotives for the new Kyoto Line, the Railway Ministry went back to Sharp-Stewart and essentially said ""Two more of those, please."" These survived in government service until 1911, when they were sold to the privately owned Bisai Railway along with a lot of other similar engines from the Shinbashi-Yokohama Line that were also considered too small and old for regular service. Renumbered 12, the engine continued working as a yard shunter, moving wagons and arranging trains, until 1957 when she was finally retired. Thanks to her historical significance she was preserved and first put on display at Meitetsu Line Park until 1963, after which she was moved to Meiji Mura, first being displayed as a static exhibit, but then restored to operation in 1973. She's undergone two major restorations since then, one in 1985 to replace her old boiler, then again in 2010.  Can you tell I'm a history student yet? :P",7년 전,249,

@sirrliv,"Glad you enjoyed it, and that I found a kindred spirit in my love for technological and architectural history. Somewhere else you might enjoy is the Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum in Koganei Park, Tokyo. This museum features a vast collection of preserved buildings from the Tokugawa/Edo Era, and a few Meiji Era buildings as well, and was one of the sites visited by Hayao Miyazaki when seeking inspiration for his magnum opus Spirited Away. Also on your list should be Ome Railway Park in Ome, Tokyo. Opened in 1962, this is Japan's oldest railway museum, and though small the open air site includes several unique survivors of Japan's age of steam, including another of the original 2-4-0 locomotives from the Shinbashi-Yokohama Line of 1871, this one built by the Yorkshire Engine Co. Finally, for the big ones at least, there's the Historical Village of Hokkaido. Far less well known than Edo-Tokyo or Meiji Mura, this museum in Sapporo nonetheless boasts a comprehensive collection of buildings from the Meiji to Showa Eras that chart Hokkaido's modern history, from traditional houses from farms and fishing villages to larger structures like the old Sapporo Railway Station and Colonization Commission Office, with much of the site being linked by a horse-drawn tram line.  If this still hasn't whetted your appetite, I'm currently researching other sites of interest regarding Japan's Meiji Era and industrial history. I would be happy to share them, if Chris doesn't mind this comment thread getting a bit longer.",7년 전,0,

@Tipper1941,"Hilarious game.  A family friend had a smaller version in her house and as kids, my older sisters and I would always want to play. We loved the sound and the lights. It all came to a screeching end when I, as a curious 7 year old, got one of the balls stuck up my nostril.  My mom was so embarrassed she asked her friend to cover the game and not let us play again.  So it sat there every visit, like a ghostly monolith trying to make us disobey our parents by clinking a few balls when we walked by.  They told us the machine was broken but I knew they just didn’t plug it in.  Oddly, I am not drawn to slots, the American equivalent.  Now that slot machines have gone digital I have even less interest without the sound  and tactile quality of dropping coins.  I believe it is because of people like me, they encase pinball games under glass and make the balls significantly bigger. You’re welcome.",7년 전,0,

@MadCowCrazy,"Sooooo..... I could go buy 5000 balls for 5000yen, then take them to one of those more expensive places and cash them in for 20 000yen? or is there perhaps a size difference in the balls to prevent such a thing? or what if I just got a ball, then had a metal shop make me 5000 balls of the same size as the one I brought them for 3000 yen? Since pachinko isn't gambling then it can't be illegal to make the balls and all you are doing is selling the balls for money at a non panchinko related place where they buy ball bearing.  If a retarded rule is made then a smart person will exploit it. Like Nordea bank where I live. If you want to exchange 5x20 bill to 1x100 it will cost money. If you hand them the money and have them put it in your bank account and once that's done withdraw it and ask for 1x100 bill then it's free. Putting in and withdrawing money is free but exchanging smaller bills for higher or higher bills for smaller costs a bank processing fee. Then again Nordea is a retarded bank as now they only allow you to put in and withdraw money from inside the bank for 5 hours on mondays and tuesdays, rest of the week they refuse. You can still use the card machine outside to withdraw money or just pay by card but there is no machine to put money into your account. If gambling machines allows you to put money into them then why isn't there such a machine for putting money into your bank account? No here at least...",7년 전,0,

For example: Let's say that a game uses gems, and it takes 51 gems to speed up something in a game. You can buy 164 gems for $5.60. How much would you pay for that upgrade?

@johannhowitzer,"It's not so much racism (belief that your race is superior and others are inferior) and more xenophobia (fear or apprehension of people from outside your country).  The word ""racism"" gets thrown around a lot more than it should, these days.  In my experience with Japanese people, many of them are especially shy or wary of non-Japanese people, but once you get to know them and demonstrate that you have similar values and will respect their culture, they are very warm and welcoming.  When I mention that I have been studying their language, they are immediately eager to talk to me.  Japanese being a difficult language, and foreigners in Japan so often failing to make a concerted effort to learn it, I'm not surprised; I think that probably goes a very long way to explain their apprehensions toward foreigners.",7년 전,2,
@Svoorhout85,"I agree that it becomes more apparent to immigrants than tourists. For example, public servants in tourist heavy places like Tokyo are hardwired to speak english to any westerner. A subway employee will aproach you ask if you need help in english when your eyes even slightly hover over a map. Wich is helpfull and pleasant if youre a tourist. But if youve been living in Japan and been using that subway to get to work every day for a long time I imagine it gets quite tiresome.",7년 전,1,
@justaguy9224,"Deb   I heard that the Japanese people are quite friendly to Hungarians because the Japanese people are thought that the Hungarians are the brothers of Japanese people. I don’t know whether that’s true or not, but I met with some Hungarians, who had been in Japan and after they had told them their nationality, everybody treated them very friendly.",7년 전(수정됨),0,
