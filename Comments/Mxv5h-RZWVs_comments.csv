@briandtnguyen,"Probably the greatest finals in NBA history.   Everybody was ballin. You know the Finals is going well when Draymond Green scores 32 points. Draymond probably felt bad for getting himself suspended and wanted to redeem himself.   Honestly, everybody played well, especially LeBron, Kyrie, and Klay.   Curry was a let down in game 7.   Although I’m glad he got a chance to redeem himself and prove he could win without KD when he pretty much won the 2022 NBA Finals by himself against the higher seeded Boston Celtics.   The 2016 finals loss gave Curry character.",5개월 전(수정됨),1,

@pnojazz,"This is the game after which the Warriors, rather than continuing to battle Cleveland, a fair fight, the Warriors call on Kevin Durant to join them. Kevin, a free agent agreed to join a 73-9 team to chase rings. How the NBA allowed the trade to go through is perplexing to say the least. The Warriors get a top two or three shooter in the league and Cleveland is playing with an injured Kevin Love and injured Kyrie Irving out for the season! And Cleveland features Matthew Delavadova at guard while LBJ has zero help, to face a Kevin Durant led Warriors team. This is where I realize that the NBA is a bit shady for allowing this trade to go through. Remember, the NBA had stopped the Chris Paul trade saying it wasn’t good for the league. Yes, but then they allow a 73-9 team to trade for Durant. Yes, the NBA is a bit shady and has favorites! If you think not, just look how they allow an already stacked roster in Boston to go and get the best defensive guard in the game, plus Porzingus, another all star center, just so Boston can get a chip,because Boston failed to get past the Warriors and a lowly Miami team for two seasons. Yes, the NBA is a bit shady, all imo. 😂",1년 전,2,

The league wanted to extend the series and didn't want it to end so fast. It is pretty obvious that the series would end in 5 in oracle because the momentum is completely on Warriors after 3-1 lead. Imagine draymond didn't get suspended, lol. The cavs still need Lebron and Kyrie scored, combined 82 points to win. I also want to mention that suspended of Dramymond is definitely bs. It is laughful because the technical foul was added after the game. What a shame for the cavs. Lebron needed the help from the league to win a ring. If he lost 2016 finals, he might leave the cavs and Curry would be the face of the nba for the next few years. That suspension wholly saved Lebron.",1년 전,1,

@tedbogan6099,"I will never how everyone gave up here in The Land when Cavs were down 3-1, but I kept telling them we’re gonna win this, and I just wasn’t saying it, I could actually feel something supernatural, I could feel the presence of God on our side, and in rewatching it and to hear James giving all the praise to God and saying he could feel it too, that truly moved me, because it holds true that if God is on your side who can be against you, none can defeat you when he has chosen to be on your side! No matter what anyone says, Kyrie and the entire team finally morphed into the team lebron kept telling them he knew they were if only they believed in themselves as much as he trusted in them, and once they crossed over into that mode of faith in themselves as a team, they became an awesome squad! And no offense to Donovan Mitchell, but bro until you can get the new Cavs to play together with confidence y’all may shine individually but you’ll never win a ring, you got to be “ALL IN”!!!",2년 전,1,

@seanm935,I don’t think we’ll ever see another NBA Finals that will top this one. Just the story line itself. 73-9 team. Clear favorites take a 3-1 lead and look prime to win it again. Then the greatness of dynamic duo of Lebron and Kyrie took over and win 3 games straight including an epic Game 7 to become the first team to come back from 3-1 to win a Finals and Bron brings a chip to the hometown team that drafted him. Like what NBA Finals is EVER topping that.,2년 전,1,
@Dognutt69,"God still to this day I can’t believe the Cavs won. I was born and raised in Cleveland Ohio and rooted for the Cavs before these finals and I root for them still till this day. This is one of those games that you remember exactly where you were at, I was at my grandmas house and my eyes were glued to the tv while I sat in front of it on the floor . I remember being so nervous and scared that the Cavs were going to lose again because when they lost in 2015 I was devastated so I knew this year we had to win. I and everyone else watching witnessed history live, but as someone who actually is from Cleveland and suffered the lost throughout the years, seeing them finally win our first championship in any sport since 1964 was amazing. I remember the block, the shot, Kevin Loves defense on Curry, LeBron’s free throw and the sound of the buzzer going off better than the back of my hand. When LeBron had that iconic block on Iguodala I screamed of joy and when Kyrie hit that game winning 3 I started to celebrate but I was still terrified, until we were up by 4 points with 10.6 seconds left of the game. The Warriors had the ball with 10.6 seconds left of the the game and Cleveland was up by 4 it was at that moment I knew the Cavs won their first ever NBA championship. The Cavs were the underdogs and they were going against a 73-9 team, no one though they could’ve came back from a 3-1 lead but as a Cavs fan I knew that the could do it and I believed in them. This game was more than just basketball. This game was history, the first team in NBA history to comeback from a 3-1 lead in the finals, the Cavs first ever NBA championship, Cleveland’s first championship in 52 years and it was the best night of my life. I remember when the clock ran out and the buzzer went off I started to celebrate and jump around, I poured water and beer on me just because how happy I was and I didn’t know what to do. I remember the day after I had to check my phone and see if the Cavs actually won and I was so happy that it wasn’t a dream. To me as a Cavs fan this made LeBron the Goat, he did something no one else ever did. He came back after 4 years and told Ohio that he was going to give us a championship and he sure did. This game made me respect LeBron as a player and person forever and he will always be the GOAT in my eyes. When LeBron left Cleveland in 2018 I wasn’t mad because he gave us a championship like he said he was going to do. In fact when LeBron left I was a big LeBron fan by then and I told my self wherever LeBron goes I go and rooted for him ever since despite he’s not on Cleveland anymore. When Kyrie left Cleveland in 2017 I wasn’t mad because I was great full for what he did for the Cavs and the city and state of Cleveland, Ohio. I also have too much respect for Kyrie and I root for him and his team to this day. Kevin Love is amazing and I will always support him as well. Also I have to thank the Warriors for choking and blowing a 3-1 lead, seriously I really appreciate that. And in wise words of LeBron James “CLEVELAND THIS IS FOR YOU!”",2년 전,8,

@EYEBALLKLOTT,"Oh, this could involve me as a key fan because if Cavazos, Cavaliers is around us? No. I have no way to read their minds and force private truth from them. How doni know i'd want to hear their private truths while they're dying or sick or withdrawing on purpose?   I pose the opposites because they lose who are WATCHING MACHING.  Prove us wrong.   So it shouldnt be bad or scary that, if asked a private (or especially a personal) question, i'd lie to protect the old man his dying dignities and wishes because he couldnt hold his bowels, for example, and insisted on living and dying while carousing the isles of Walmart, por ejemplo.   Anyway, I don't and never did take interest in sports. It wasn't until I could hear the talkers involving the audience pretty deep on subjects- which have nothing to do with sports - that I thought maybe I should try to tune this blather in as if i need an important chef's guideline out of it. Maybe a snippet or a cut of those words, least the loss become swords against my younger brother, whos voice sounds exactly like these new Jersey types. Very Norm for us but less so for Mexicans generations here after ours. Theyre afraid we're a Jewish invasion and often treat us that way. Thats how often i hear the Cavaliers in California. They oughtta live on our screens here. Android is full of strangers from around the world who are safe from usas long as they know what a lie is. You just don't say the right things when another needed to hear if from you because times filled with events to work around are in the way and at the time they did, they had to lie down. They passed by the court dates they couldve taken that wouldve saved my moms life. But they went to Mecca, Mexico, ireland,  Japan, Russia, Tunisia, Germany, Hungary and wherever else talkers on screens go. And they kept what i couldnt have Heard so i was treated to months of attacks to force theyr accounts through to some form of RELEVANCE.   It's still blather to me. He's now dead. Blather lived to be 85,  I don't know those codes and he didnt either. Faux pas brought pork Toba kosher Foods table before I was born. And I can't see it so I can't prove from it anything beyond that pork sgoykdvbe here and the kosher table should be on the Road with many screeners in between so she has no pork in her kosher eyes, in other words.   That's basketball with some distracting blabber.   For me,  faster talk than i can listen just fails me. If it fails me it fails my entire family.  How many videos can Youtube send us as a corporate source family of our kind? 1st, none. First you get us to a desk or table with you, then outline a plan. Then we talk deals. The phone & screens come last in life.   I'm trained to rely on my eyes as an artist who has a strict and steady touch and sense for whos too close to me and who im too close to.   I can do very fine lines and smooth curves and my touch is a light tender touch on a screen.  But I can't hear a damn point you're making when I'm looking in front of me and the one with the jerky has no face talking my name after having let with lle in person. Dough a tier isnt enough. Dough and venison was that idea. Dough for a bread and deer dish for us to eat.   I'm what's called a ""talented artist"". I could design a sports logo that would be bought up. Yes, I could.   Do you trust that of me? Hopefully you'd ask to see what im capable of before you tossed me an attack to clear up. Mexicos emissarys shut me out. Because we arent this station's kind of good Samaritans. We keep fences and closed doors and we don't hold any Market rights though its us.   As far as talk: If you dropped off a paper with a bullet list of questions or points for me to give my opinions or feelings, perspectives, put a mood to, tell my story or for your entertainers, i could tell the inquisitor what the common sense is for me...or to build counterpoints against in 1 paragraph, I could flip the points.   (TYPO ∆)  I said if I had the time I WOULD TAKE to flip the points in an argument against me, but i don't like games of maybes.   I COULD flip points. Proof takes more than point flipping. Flippers steal, yes they do. Its my humble observation that flippers steal. Opinion or that i don't own in there or youre holding stolen property at every Chevron for a Tiff. Plainly. Salt, no sugar, light ice.    I could give the sportscasters paragraph a read, and in less time than it would take me to sort what you're saying (if on radio , for example), I could work with them in a Q & A.  But not while they're at work.   They're in the middle of raising money for themselves, I guessed. I don't know how they really live. I don't hear sports teams this close to Hollywood who come from '...the nation of tjeyrv!', living in garage apartments with office rooms built in and... when they're safe from the laws of the basketball courts (so I can't say what they're going through), Same the sportscasters ive never got to visit because of their Imam from Mary B Perry 1988 who have no feast for my perfect Rama Goddamn ham month on cheez its and boiled eggs Paul Mitchell taste while touring from Scotland, again refusing to eat their imported weetabix and food imports instead of the people's food boxes while they collect from music experiences.     I don't know any sportscasters in real life.   But this is California. They're in India If on Chevron. I can't stw[ into India, Chevron so you'd best make a firm biz choice for the Go side.     If so, these side ones need who makes these players feel stronger than weaker when on the court because these sports fit into my living room. Frank doesn't fit into my belly.   Maybe some of the players have at home issues they need to keep at home?  That spat. I said it spat. Patoooey!   I think lawyers and attorneys need to stay in their offices during their working public access hours and let the public knock during their listed working hours when we are ready to engage their fancies.   I don't think they should be on public cases in our private time out of their offices i a place where they're so far out of they're rights of access.   Thats what i wrote. They're deep into Thailand, England, Ireland, Scotland, Turkey, Iran, Russia, Ohio, Canada, Mexico, New Jersey, San Francisco, San Jose CA, Tobago, Africa, all the ones who got   QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT  notices from my family account.  Hi, I'm a martin. My relatives are pilots and handcrafters and people who mind our business and stay out of running yours. We're chauffer types.   How's Haas avocados yet? Did you know the California Haas avocado is a relative of my family and is the root ward of 'HOSPITAL', as it's SAID? ""HAAS BIT OL"" would be how to spell it. But, with more lower cases and 3 taller cases.    Ask me anything.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

Maybe game 7 in a finals this could be in that category. But a series? That’s just ignorance. 1984 was far more impactful. It’s basically black vs white. Had 4 all time great games. Had several iconic moments. Lakers vs Celtics rivalry. This series can’t compete with that finals.,1년 전(수정됨),0,
@TheSands83, @CarlosTorres-hg4op the 2016 warriors were not the best team of all time😂 they had the record for wins but the best team ever doesn’t go down 3-1 in the conference finals then blow a 3-1 lead. The playoffs exposed them as being way too dependent on the 3. As soon as cavs figured not to try n out shoot then from 3 n don’t shoot 3s near like they had been they won 3 straight. The warriors needed a guy like Durant to beat a healthy cavs team who actually had the better roster… just look at it in 2016 lebron > curry.   Kyrie > klay.

@mrsinister8943,When LeBron retires we will really miss watching him play. Of course nobody will ever match Jordan's mythical aura of winning but what LeBron has done has been legendary. Hes won 4 titles and played in 10 finals. Led the only team to ever beat that Spurs team and came back down to beat this 73 win Warriors team. I always wished that LBJ would of had a coach like Phil Jackson or PoP. He went to 7 straight finals I believe and faced some very tough competition and legendary performances like vs Dirk and the Mavs. LBJ didn't have a Jerry Krause or Phil Jackson his whole career though he did have Riley who helped him win back to back titles. We are gonna look back at the LeBron era and have alot of great memories. Plus he seems like a genuinely good person. I hope he can get one more title before he retires but I doubt it. Winning a title is very difficult and having 4 of them is no easy task.and especially against some of the team's he's faced.,2년 전,6,

@darnelldabachelor9605,#LebronJames #ShannonSharpe #SkipBayless this is the moment that defined and shaped #KD career. Golden State lost after being up 3-1.

Nothing! This game helped KD win two rings! He will never win another one until LBJ retires; unless he goes back to Golden State or a team that beat him the year before! Lol…,3년 전,0,

@jordynstief3225,"Meanwhile during the final moments of Game 7 of the NBA 2016 Finals... Mike Breen: 6.5 seconds remain on the clock here in the fourth quarter as the Cleveland Cavaliers lead 138-89, thanks to their feminine friend, Temporary Cleveland Cavalier #27, Queen Madame Ninja Barrett. Not much is known about this sports star from the wrestling circuit other than her ability to predict the movements and read the patterns of her opponents. Queen Madame Ninja Barrett: (with the basketball in her possession.) Okay. You can do this, Ninja. Time to send the Cleveland Curse running for the hills. I have to be mindful, though. There's only 6 seconds left, after all. (readying her special shot as she channels her heart and soul into the ball.) All of Cleveland's pain, heartache, sorrow, agony, strife, anguish, heartbreak, torment, all 52 years of it, it officially dies tonight! Let my purification and revitalization reign over Cleveland. unleashes a Super Saiyan scream (goes Super Saiyan, much to the surprise of both teams.) Alright. Let's see if you can handle this. I'll be the one to reverse this. Me. Me! I'm going to defeat you. Time to shift the dynamic of Cleveland, provide a miracle for the first time since '64, return the city to it's former glory, change it's fate, quench this drought, erase the 52 years bad luck and rewrite history. I'm calling this one the Curse Breaker's Drought Quenching Kiss of Death.  Mo Williams: (watches as she prepares to throw her special shot.) Oh my word. Oh, she's a god if she makes this. Ninja: (throws her special shot from the half court and watches as it goes in.) Okay. Hopefully, that should do it. Mike: It's now 141-89. I don't know what happened, but the Cavaliers have now soared into a staggering lead. buzzer sounds Mike: It's over. It's over. Cleveland's a city of champions once again. The Cavaliers are NBA Champions. Cleveland's long sports nightmare has ended. The drought is over. 52 years, time to celebrate a title. Ninja: (as she transforms back to normal, gracefully drops the basketball onto the court and dusts off her hands.) blows the smoke from her hands Well, I'm sure this'll make for an interesting MVP conversation. chuckles to herself (sees her fellow Cleveland Cavaliers approaching her.) Oh. I take it this means the Cleveland Curse is broken? Kevin Love: I guess so. Sasha Kaun: Well, you certainly gave the Warriors a show they'll never forget. Kyrie Irving: Judging by your performance, I won't put it past you if you somehow manage to beat LeBron James for Finals MVP. Ninja: No, I've got a feeling that he'll still get that accolade in the end. You figure, there was a letter that he wrote to his fans 2 years ago that made it clear that he was coming home to bring Cleveland a championship. So, based on that, he's still got a slight edge against me, but we'll see what my dear friend, NBA Commissioner, Adam Silver has to say. J.R. Smith: Oh, that's true. Tristan Thompson: Wait. So, how many points did you end up getting us? Ninja: (points at the final scoreboard.) Look at the final score and be thankful you guys have me on a temporary Cavaliership. All: (look at the final score.) Whoa. Kevin: Okay. I did the math and looks like she extended our lead by 52 points. Ninja: Yep. Hey, wait a minute. Where's LeBron? Kevin: (points to him on his knees.) Oh, he's over there letting his emotions let loose knowing that he finally fulfilled his promise to the city that drafted him all those years ago. Ninja: I see. Mike: And the emotions for LeBron James who delivers on his promise to come home and bring a championship to his beloved hometown and of course the disappointment, the stunning disappointment on the other end. James Jones, his long time teammate, who’s been with him through all 6 consecutive finals and an emotional Tyronn Lue. LeBron James: Oh my god. James Jones: (approaches and embraces her.) You did it, kid. You did it. You helped us break the Cleveland Curse. Ninja: I'm kind of aware of this. Now, can you please let me approach your teammate so I can comfort him? James: Oh, certainly. Ninja: Thank you. (approaches, takes him in her arms, holds and comforts him.) LeBron: Kid, you absolutely killed it. Ninja: Thank you, Monsieur James. Well, I've got a feeling that my Lone Wolf boyfriend and SmackDown tag partner will probably be here soon. I probably should let Commissioner Silver know to be expecting him. (texts her dear friend, the NBA Commissioner to let him know to expect the Lone Wolf.) There we go. The message has been sent. I think I'm gonna stick around for the trophy presentation and then just go. Iman Shumpert: Alright. Richard Jefferson: Okay. Channing Frye: Well, kid. That was certainly an impressive showing. Matthew Dellavedova: So, what exactly brought you to Cleveland? Ninja: Fate and a desire to learn more about the Cleveland Curse as I've recently grown interested in learning about sports related curse phenomenons in certain cities and certain states. Meanwhile at the front entrance of the Oracle Arena... AJ Hawk: (in the car to the Lone Wolf.) Alright, man. I think this is where you get off. Baron Corbin: (exits the car.) Keep the car running. AJ: Got it. Baron: (enters the arena, clearly ready to begin his hunt for his Lone Wolfess.) Alright. I'm here, my Lone Wolfess. Where are you? (notices another man approaching him.) Oh, looks like this man's a friend of my Lone Wolfess. Adam Silver: Welcome. I am NBA Commissioner, Adam Silver. I take it you must be Ninja's lover? Baron: Yes, (as he shakes the NBA Commissioner's hand.) Baron Corbin. Adam: Oh, yes. Ninja told me to be expecting you. You're actually just in time for the trophy presentation. Follow me right this way. I'll take you to her. (leads him to the podium as it's being set up on the court for the trophy presentation to find his dear friend.) Baron: Coming, Mr. Silver. (follows the NBA Commissioner out to the podium as it's being set up on the court for the trophy presentation in order to find his Lone Wolfess.) Yeah. I deeply apologize for bothering you about this, Mr. Silver, but I just want to fetch my Lone Wolfess and bring her back to Las Vegas so she can wrap up Money In The Bank. Adam: It's no problem at all, sir. (to the Lone Wolf as they enter the basketball court, ready to locate their feminine friend.) By the way, since you’re here, would you like to witness the trophy presentation? Baron: Sure. Queen Madame Ninja Barrett: (notices the two men as she changes back into her normal attire and motions them over to where she is.) Baron: Oh, there you are, my Lone Wolfess. As soon as we witness the trophy presentation, you and I need to head back over to Money In The Bank in Las Vegas. Ninja: Understood. Mike Breen: What a scene, an emotional scene for LeBron James. These diehard fans, so passionate. They so love their teams, decades of heartbreak of being teased, but it never diminished their passion and now, they’re rewarded with an NBA Championship. As always, the terrific sportsmanship. So much more to come here from Oracle Arena as LeBron James and the Cavaliers win the NBA Championship and the celebration just underway in the city of Cleveland. Let’s go to Doris. Doris Burke: Mike, overcome with emotion is exactly how I would describe LeBron’s reaction as he shares a hug with Kyrie. I’ll give him a minute, but he’s still crying tears (as someone bumps into her.) of joy. (approaches him.) LeBron. Kyrie Irving: Oh, I’m sorry, Doris. Doris: No, no worries, Kyrie. LeBron, as soon as that buzzer sounded, your emotions let loose. Can you describe what you’re feeling right now? LeBron James: I set out a goal, two years. I gave everything that I have. I put my heart and my blood and my sweat and my tears in this game and against all odds, against all odds, I don’t know why we want to take the hardest road. I don’t know why the man above gave me the hardest road but there’s nothing the man above going to put new situations that you can’t handle. And I just kept the same, positive at attitude like, instead of saying why me? I was saying this is what he wanted me to do. Cleveland, this is for you! Doris: LeBron, you did what no other team had been able to do, coming back from a 3-1 deficit in the Finals and to do that, you had to win twice in a place that proved too much for so many teams. What did you find in Game 5 here? LeBron: Just locked in. I had to change my approach a little bit on how I approach the game. I wasn’t that good in the first two games here in this building. I watched a lot of film, detailed it out, changed my blueprint and was able to put together some spectacular games after being down 3-1. History, we in the record books. We the first team ever to come back from a 3-1 deficit. This is special. Doris: We’ll see you in a few minutes on the podium for the trophy presentation. LeBron: Alright. Thank you, Doris. Mike: One of the great storybook endings in all of sports. And it looked like earlier in the Finals like it was going to end like so many other seasons for the Cleveland sports teams with a defeat and a wait til next year. And LeBron James and the Cavaliers win 3 straight, 2 here in Oracle Arena. Has there ever been a player more valuable to his team than James has been in Cleveland the last two years? You think about what he was able to accomplish, coming back to Cleveland, making a statement, taking a team that had been awful the previous four years and flat out got it done. Those four years he was in Miami, Cleveland had the worst record in the NBA during that stand. He comes back, back to back Finals and a championship season for the city of Cleveland. Final score, Game 7: Cavaliers 141, Warriors 89. We’ll be back to Oracle Arena for the trophy presentation.

@jordynstief3225,"Meanwhile as the trophy presentation’s getting underway... Mike Breen: A shocking ending for Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors who lose their last two games in Oracle Arena, the most dominant home court in the NBA over the past two years as they fail to repeat, coming up short in Game 7 against the Queen Madame Ninja Barrett led Cleveland Cavaliers. LeBron James came back home to deliver a championship to his hometown. He fulfilled his promise tonight with a spectacular road performance in the 4th quarter to win the championship. Let’s get the ceremony going right now to our PA announcer, Matt Hurwitz. Matt Hurwitz: Ladies and gentlemen, please direct your attention to center court for the presentation of the Larry O’Brien trophy and the 2016 Bill Russel NBA Finals Most Valuable Player award. Please welcome ABC’s Doris Burke. Doris Burke: Ladies and gentlemen, with us tonight to present the 2016 NBA Championship trophy, please welcome NBA Commissioner, Adam Silver. Adam Silver: You just witnessed one of the greatest games in NBA history. To the Golden State Warriors, congratulations on a historic season. To Joe Lacob, Peter Guber and Coach Kerr, you’re all a class act and the NBA thanks you. And now, Dan Gilbert, your partners, your family, Coach Lue and your terrific Cleveland Cavaliers, congratulations, you’re the first team in the history of the NBA to come back from a 3-1 deficit to win the championship. And to Northeast Ohio and Cleveland, the curse is over. The 52 year drought has come to an end. Let me present the championship trophy. (presents the NBA Championship trophy.) Doris: Dan, we had shots all night, Dan of your fans back in Cleveland. You said you felt an obligation to bring a title to those hungry fans. Why? Dan Gilbert: People of Cleveland deserves it more than any people I’ve ever seen, met or felt. And thank God that God loves Cleveland, Ohio. He does and I want to thank everybody. I want to thank David Griffin and the front office, Ty and the coaching staff, everybody in the entire franchise, the best fans in the world and LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers. Doris: Well, that trophy found an appropriate person to carry it. When LeBron left in the fashion that he did after the first time, could you ever have envisioned him returning and fulfilling this dream? Dan: I couldn’t hear you exactly, Doris, but all I know is that no group deserves this more, no fan base deserves this more. And I’m speechless and proud of everybody. It’s like a fantasy for everybody and thank you, Cleveland. Love you, Cleveland. And thank you to the Golden State Warriors and Joe Lacob. You’re a class act. It was a great series, great series. Doris: Congratulations. Ty Lue. Ty, there was a point in which you were down 3-1, but your confidence never faltered. What was it about the character of this group that you never doubted them? Tyronn Lue: Just, we’ve been through adversity all year and you know, we went through a lot and you know, God’s counted us out, you know, they said we couldn’t get it done, but it ain’t about me, it’s about the guys. You know, I’d go to war with these guys any night, any day and they stuck with it and we had a chance to give up. We made history tonight and I told these guys, “You know, all year we’ve been making history, why not tonight?” So, these guys came out, had a great showing, I’ll go to war, battle with these guys every single night. I just want to give a shout-out to Mexico, Missouri and Cleveland, Ohio. We’re coming back, baby. Let’s go! Doris: Ty, you’ve played alongside some of the all time greats. Shaq, Kobe, Michael, we are witnessing a once in the generation players in LeBron James. What makes this man so extraordinarily special? Tyronn: You know, outside of his basketball talent, that’s what you look at when you see on the floor is the basketball talent, the way you control a game and take over a game and things like that, but the biggest thing for LeBron, the reason why he deserves this is because he has a great heart and he’s always giving. He’s given to everyone and it’s not just about basketball. It’s about who he is as a person and great things happen to great people. So, I’m just happy for LeBron. I’m happy for the city of Cleveland, the state of Ohio, the Cleveland Cavaliers organization and Mexico, Missouri. We in the house, baby. Doris: Two shout-outs for Mexico. Congratulations. Time now to bring back NBA Commissioner, Adam Silver to present the MVP award. Adam: As you can see, there are two MVP trophies on this podium, one obviously recognizing the Finals MVP and the other one for the new category we’re opening up today, recognizing the Curse Breaker MVP. Two years ago, he wrote a letter to his fans in which he said, “I’m coming home.” And he said that nothing is given to you in Northeast Ohio, everything is earned. LeBron, it was unanimous. Most Valuable Player 2016, NBA Finals. Congratulations. (hands him the MVP trophy.) Now, for the Curse Breaker MVP. Despite the fact that she didn’t get involved until the second half, her multiple Curse Breaker shots were more than enough to break this curse and quench this 52 year drought. (turns toward her.) My friend, it was unanimous. The inaugural 2016 Curse Breaker MVP, NBA Finals. Congratulations. (shakes her hand, embraces her and presents her the inaugural Curse Breaker MVP trophy.) Queen Madame Ninja Barrett: (takes the inaugural Curse Breaker MVP trophy from her dear friend, the NBA Commissioner.) Doris: LeBron, in the letter that Adam Silver referenced, you said that the most important thing to you was to bring a championship to Northeast Ohio. Why was that so important? LeBron James: I understood what the people of Northeast Ohio been through the last 50+ years. I kept it at bay. I never stressed the fact that I didn’t feel the pressure, that none of those things so it always kept me level headed, but I understood what everyone in Northeast Ohio been through the last 50+ years and I’m happy to be a part of history. I can’t wait to get back home. I’m ready to get to you guys. Doris: What kind of character did it require of a group that had so many playing in their first NBA Finals to come out and win on this floor? LeBron: We’ve been through so much adversity these last two years. I just knew what we was capable of, even being down 3-1 versus the greatest regular season team ever. You know, 73-9 and everybody counted us out and that’s where we strive most when everybody counted us out and that’s definitely where I strive the most when everyone counted me out. Doris: LeBron, you won two titles in Miami and I know they meant the world to you. Why does this one feel different? LeBron: I’m home. I’m home. This is what I came back for. I’m at a loss for words. This is unbelievable. It doesn’t feel real right now. Doris: Congratulations, LeBron. LeBron: Thank you, Doris. Thank you so much. Doris: Kyrie Irving, are you around me? Kyrie, a year ago, you were alone in the hospital room watching your team do battle and try to win an NBA Championship. Can you describe what it was like for you going to battle and ultimately fulfilling one of your childhood dreams you said? Kyrie Irving: History was made tonight, but I mean, that championship team that’s in that locker room right there, we’ve got to give them a lot of credit. They did an amazing job and for us, it was just about being resilient and coming in to take care of business, but I mean, this is one for the books. Literally, one for the books. Doris: Down the stretch, though, it had been tough at times, difficult series for Kevin Love. The big three was able to deliver. Why was that? Kyrie: Just staying aggressive, sticking to the game plan and executing offensively and defensively, but I’m glad all the X’s and O’s are done and we can celebrate this championship. Doris: Can you describe what it’s like playing alongside of LeBron James and what effect he has on this group’s ability to be confident that it can win regardless of the circumstance? Kyrie: Best player on the planet right there. As you can see with the Finals MVP, he took us home tonight and that’s what he does. That’s what great players do and he made history tonight. And I’m proud of him. Doris: Congratulations. Tristan Thompson. I don’t know many guys, Tristan, that would embrace so readily the dirty work that you pursue on a nightly basis. Why? Why are you so able to embrace that role? Tristan Thompson: It’s a starting role. Let's look at a championship team as a puzzle. Everyone has, you know, the roles. Some guys score, the fan and for me, just do the dirty work and just be a starting role. Doris: You told us yesterday that your Father is responsible for the toughness that you display and it is Father’s Day and he can’t be here, but I know he’s watching. What would you say to him? Tristan: Thank you for everything, just the toughness, the work ethic he instilled in our family. I love you, Pops. Doris: I’ll put the same question to you. You’re playing alongside a once in a generation player in LeBron James. What makes this man so great? Tristan: Michael Jackson said he’s a bad, bad man, Doris. Just how he’s able to elevate everyone’s game and just help us young guys, show us what it takes to win a championship. Doris: Congratulations, Tristan. And congratulations to the 2016 NBA Champions, Cleveland Cavaliers. Baron Corbin: Okay. I think maybe we should go. Ninja: Right. Well, I'd hate to take the inaugural Curse Breaker MVP trophy and go, but let's just say that I have some business to attend to on the squared circle home front. Both: (leave the basketball court.)",3년 전,1,
@jordynstief3225,"After the events of Game 7 of the NBA 2016 Finals... Both: (arrive at the front entrance of the Oracle Arena.) Baron Corbin: (texts his accomplice to let him know that he's with his Lone Wolfess.) Okay. I just texted Mr. Hawk. Queen Madame Ninja Barrett: (with the inaugural Curse Breaker MVP trophy in her possession.) Wait. Monsieur Hawk accompanied you to get me? Baron: (nods in response to his Lone Wolfess's question.) Yes. Ninja: Oh, you and Monsieur Hawk are so sweet. Yeah. I kinda feel bad for Monsieur Hawk right now, knowing that he's going to have to drive home in an insane amount of traffic in Cleveland due to the celebration taking place that'll soon extend to the entirety of Ohio itself. Baron: I'm sure he'll be fine. Ninja: Yeah. You're right. Baron: Did you know that Mr. Silver was even planning on opening up the Curse Breaker MVP award category? Ninja: No, I didn't. He's full of surprises. ???: (approaching them.) calls out to them in a familiar voice Wait. Ninja. Both: (turn to see the NBA Commissioner approaching them.) Baron: Speaking of the man of the hour. Ninja: (to her dear friend, the NBA Commissioner.) Oh, Monsieur Silver. Have you come to walk us out? Adam Silver: Yes, I have. Look, I know you're currently preparing to return to the ring as I'm sure your obligation as the premier fighter's calling, but Mr. Gilbert (as he reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a folded piece of paper given to him by the majority owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers.) wanted me to give you this before you left. Ninja: (takes the folded piece of paper from her dear friend, the NBA Commissioner.) Thank you, Monsieur Silver. (unfolds it and takes a look at it before looking up at her dear friend, the NBA Commissioner in confusion.) What the heck even is this? Adam: Listen, Mr. Gilbert was so impressed by your performance in Game 7 tonight here at the Oracle Arena against the Golden State Warriors that he wanted to offer you an extension of your Temporary Cleveland Cavaliership. Ninja: Well, dang. That's rather generous. (pulls out a pen.) I'll need to borrow a table. Adam: Oh, here. (brings over a small table.) I think we can use this. Ninja: Oh, how convenient. (sets the extension of the Temporary Cleveland Cavaliership down on the table.) Let's just do ourselves a favor and get this over with. clicks pen (signs the extension of her Temporary Cleveland Cavaliership.) There we go. (folds it back up and passes it back to her dear friend, the NBA Commissioner.) Adam: (retrieves the signed extension of her Temporary Cleveland Cavaliership from his dear friend to give back to the majority owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers as he puts it back into his coat pocket.) Thank you. So, the extension of your Temporary Cleveland Cavaliership won't come into effect until October. Ninja: October. Wait. That's when the Cavaliers have their ring ceremony, right? Adam: Yes. Ninja: So, since I'm the inaugural Curse Breaker MVP, that means that I'll probably receive my championship ring either second to last or last. Adam: Yes. That's the long and the short of it. We're just not sure which way it'll be yet, but if you want, I'll let you know as soon as I find out maybe a few weeks prior to the ring ceremony. Ninja: Okay. Baron: (to his Lone Wolfess's dear friend, the NBA Commissioner.) You know, I think I'm starting to understand why my Lone Wolfess gravitates toward you so much. Like her, you emit a sense of calm and have, in your own way, become like a pillar of strength for everyone to lean on. Adam: Is that how you view me, Mr. Corbin? Baron: I mean, that's certainly how my Lone Wolfess views her connection with you. Adam: Wow. I guess I really never thought of it like that. Oh, do you both want me to escort you out? Ninja: If you wouldn't mind, Monsieur Silver. Adam: Alright. In that case, follow me. (leads them to the door of Oracle Arena.) Both: (follow the NBA Commissioner out of the Oracle Arena.) Adam: Okay. (turns toward his dear friend.) Well, my friend. The Cavaliers and I will see you in October at the Quicken Loans Arena for the ring ceremony. Ninja: Alright. See you then, Monsieur Silver.  Both: (walk out of Oracle Arena and toward the waiting vehicle.) AJ Hawk: (pulls up to the entrance of the Oracle Arena.) Hey. You guys ready to blow this popsicle stand? Baron: Ready as we'll ever be, Hawk. Both: (get in the car and drive away.) AJ: I can't believe it. The inaugural Curse Breaker MVP. Alright. So, the plan is I'm going to drop the two of you off at the arena in Las Vegas and then just go. Baron: That's fine. Ninja: Yeah. Well, I appreciate the both of you doing this, but I could've probably just teleported myself and the Lone Wolf to the arena. AJ: Hey. It's no problem at all. Ninja: Yeah. Hey, listen. I feel bad for you right now, knowing that you're going to have to drive home in an insane amount of traffic due to the celebration taking place in Cleveland that I'm sure will soon be extending to the entirety of Ohio itself. AJ: Yeah. I'm sure it's going to be insane by the time I get back home. Baron: I thought your friend was very decent, my Lone Wolfess. Ninja: Yeah. AJ: Wait. (turns toward the Lone Wolf.) You actually met Commissioner Silver? Baron: Yeah. I guess my Lone Wolfess told him to be expecting me. A while later in Las Vegas during Money In The Bank... AJ Hawk: (pulls up to the arena.) Alright, guys. I think this is where the both of you get off. Both: (exit the car.) Queen Madame Ninja Barrett: (with the inaugural Curse Breaker MVP trophy in her possession.) Alright. Thanks, Hawk. Just be careful getting home. AJ: Okay. (drives away.) Baron Corbin: Alright. Now, let's get inside and finish the Money In The Bank pay per view. Ninja: Of course, mi amor. I think I kept my Shield brothers waiting long enough. Both: (enter the arena.) Ninja: (takes the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.) Alright. Let's do this. Here. (gives the Lone Wolf her inaugural Curse Breaker MVP trophy.) Would you mind running that into my black metallic kingdom locker room for me while I take care of my Shield brothers? Baron: (takes the inaugural Curse Breaker MVP trophy from his Lone Wolfess.) Of course. (runs it into her locker room.)",3년 전,1,

Unlike golden state who was chasing 72-10, playing their starters heavy minutes up until the last game of the season.    Lebron > curry Kyrie > klay Love > draymond  Cavs definitely had more star power than the warriors and they matched up well with them because draymond couldn’t guard Kevin Love and Lebron at the same time.  (Especially not when he’s suspended lol)  Cavs also had a major advantage rebounding because of GS’s small lineup   The Cavs came back 3-1 and they deserve much praise  But let’s quit acting like the Cavs roster was Lebron with a bunch of bums.

I’m close to NY and would love to see him play in Brooklyn, but he is too busy trying to take a stand.   Weird thing is, he has dug himself so deep into his position that now he can’t just say “well, enough data is out there, I’ll get the vaccine”.   Thanks for the memories Kyrie.  That’s all you really are now.",3년 전,2,

Most of the current fans in the stands are now made up silicon valley tech dudes who don't know the game of basketball, they don't have a clue about any of the current or existing players, and stop going as soon as the team hits a rough spot. Unfortunately, the loyal long time fans have been priced out of games by silicon valley dudes.   It's not me saying this, it's my friends who work in silicon valley saying this. They have too many coworkers who don't know who confuse Kerr for Curry. The same has happened to Niners and their fans.",3년 전,0,

When Green hit his 4th 3 in this game (after coming in 0 for his last 10) I just remember thinking someone somewhere clearly put some kind of hex on that city. So glad the Cavs beat them. I even felt bad for the 2016 Indians vs the Cubs. I’m a Cub fan but couldn’t help shaking my head for Indian fans. Up 3-1 in the series, then goes to gm 7, down 3 in the 8th.

KD was the middle finger to the nba for the Dray suspension which made the momentum of this finals switch dramatically. However, again, warriors would have the last laugh going 3-1 in finals appearances against the Cavs ending their revival and sending Kyrie,Lbj on their way to other teams while making the rest of the league salty they were back on top. Also people that say “ohhh warriors would of lost in 2015 had Kyrie not been injuried”...they were down 1-3 to the warriors when he was with them...lol people forget how dominant that warriors team was. The nba looked at who would make the biggest story and the most money from sales and sold this series to the nba fan base especially when their golden boy Lbj was about to lose AGAIN in the finals. Think about how much money was riding on this finals compared to all others. Side note..look at how the refs let the Cavs play ruff that series but every time warriors played hard they got called on petty fouls. Truly it was impressive to be up 3-1 anyways considering how much was being givin to the Cavs. I get that’s in all sports but that’s my point. This isn’t the first time this has happened. Lakers vs kings playoffs? For one example. Anyways still happy warriors had the last laugh but this will always be a disappointment of a series.",4년 전,0,

@AdonisKeef,Compared to how teams play now in 2020 these warriors are chumps. It’s crazy to see that they really were just the first team to start taking advantage of the 3. The warriors dynasty is nothing more than them abusing the numerical advantage they had by taking a bunch of 3s while the rest of the league still relied on 2s. The entire league plays in the style of these warriors now. It’s like what the rockets tried doing with small ball but with the complete opposite outcome. The fact this experimental team was able to beat James and Irving in their prime along with changing the entire culture of the nba is legendary. The warriors put a huge dent on Lebron’s legacy in 2015 as it he now had lost his first trip to the finals in every team he played for. In 2016 as an experimental team relying on odds rather than talent they choked after being up 3-1. In 2017 KD decided to single handily destroy Lebron’s planned narrative of surpassing Michael Jordan in championships just by joining the warriors. In 2018 the GSW gave lebron his 6th NBA loss and his second sweep in the playoffs. Officially making him the only player to ever get swept in the playoffs in two different decades.  In 2019 lebron ran away from Cleveland and finally joined the lakers after saying he would never leave Cleveland... again. He then missed about 20 games and somehow failed to make the finals with a team that had more talent than the team he took to the 2018 finals. The Lakers ended up with the exact same record they had the year prior to him arriving here. When lebron realized he could not win on his own he stopped embarrassing himself and started recruiting Anthony Davis. In 2020 the Lakers traded almost their entire team to the New Orleans pelicans who suspiciously won the 1st pick the next year. (😉 right Adam silver? ) Anthony Davis then proceeded to have an amazing season leading the Lakers in every stat except assist yet Lebron almost won MVP because of how hard the media drives his narrative.  In the 2020 NBA finals Jimmy Butler finally showed Lebron James what it’s takes to win a championship thanks to hard work and determination instead of special treatment and shortcuts. What a wonderful world we live in ☺️,5년 전,0,

@yourdad774,"pimk I’m listening to what comes out of his mouth. He forced his way out of Cleveland. He started dissing his teammates in Boston mid season. Then come the playoffs he shoots 35% and 21% from three and says he should have shot more. He blames his teammates while actively choking the series away singlehandedly. Not to mention the Celtics took Lebron to 7 in the ECF and Kyrie comes back and chokes in the second round. Then he goes to Brooklyn, and says they need more pieces, meanwhile counting out the people who he thinks are valuable. In that list he leaves off Jarett Allen and says DeAndre Jordan and Garrett Temples washed up ass. The Nets play better without him and Levert balls out. I think you should maybe open your fucking eyes and see what this dude does. Does a lot of talking for a second option.",5년 전,0,
@mkibrahim6,"YourDad  LOL Ok, If Kyrie is so cancerous, surely his teammates must hate him right?(logically) Now I beg of you to show me just 1, just 1 instance of a teammate on any of the teams he’s been on that has ever had anything negative to say about him. Shouldn’t be that hard now, since he’s the cancer that you claim he is. Also Kyrie spent 2 seasons in Boston and everything you wrote up there happened in the 2nd season. So what about the 1st? When he lead them to the 1st seed (before he got hurt) and had a 17 win streak? Kyrie wasn’t cancerous then I guess right?",5년 전,0,
@yourdad774,"pimk Rozier said he had to sacrifice to play with Kyrie and rightfully so, he led that team much farther than Kyrie did. No player just comes out and says they hate a player apart from Kyrie apparently. I mean you still have to be blind if you can’t see how everybody played better without Kyrie. Rozier balled in the playoffs, Tatum and brown are allstars without Kyrie. Kyrie still singlehandedly choked the bucks playoffs. And the 17 game win streak was against a stretch of the weakest teams in the league.",5년 전,0,
@mkibrahim6,"YourDad  Of course Rozier would say that. He didn’t like coming off the bench. I’d argue he’s the most toxic of that locker room. Considering his selfish interests as depicted in that interview(he cared more about himself that the team) And apart from Rozier, everyone else on that team still loves/respect him.  And about the win streak, my point was about his toxicity, and You still haven’t explained exactly how he was cancerous in that 1st season.  And now, that playoff run was honestly overrated imo for few reasons  Firstly Kyrie was one of the reasons they clinched the 2nd seed(they were 1st before he went down) and that secured them home court. Now go back that check throughout that playoff run, they only won ONE game on the road. Also who did they beat? - A 44 win bucks and a sixers that choked heavily.  -They also couldn’t beat a dreadful cavs team that lebron heavily carried. They did great no doubt but that playoff run gave those guys inflated egos that disrupted the chemistry when Kyrie and Gordon came back, because as far as chemistry was concerned, everything was great before Kyrie went down.  Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not taking all the blame off Kyrie. He was ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL in that bucks series, but that’s about all the blames he gets from me.",5년 전,0,
@yourdad774,"pimk No other player in basketball has called out his teammates as much as he has, twice with the Celtics and once already with the nets. He literally called them out in the middle of the series, that HE was choking away. Rozier might have a big ego but Kyries is ten times the size of his. Kyrie is a second option and nothing else, he acts like he’s the second coming of Jordan",5년 전,0,

What gets me mad is the fact that people like you say that lebron was the carrying the cavs when we all know thats not fucking True. If it weren’t for allen lebron wouldn’t have that ring and if it weren’t for kyrie lebron wouldn’t have that historical victory. Lebron got lots of help but still is 4-7 in the finals so dont get all but hurt when people say that mj is the goat.,4년 전,1,

@smoothsavage2870,"Yes, the Cavs were the better team. I'll provide you the context for this (i'll try to make it as short as i can, sorry if it's too long).   This was the 2nd iteration of one of Lebron's superteams immediately after leaving his last one (Miami Heat or Heatles) because DeWayne Wade and Chris Bosh were aging and their production was starting to decrease. So Lebron went back to Cleveland to join Kyrie (Kyrie was averaging 21 points per game and was an all star) and Kevin Love (was averaging 26 points per game and 12 rebounds per game and also was an all star). *All stars are NBA players that are exceptional in a statistical category (generally scoring).  This gets largely overlooked because Lebron has a HUGE fanbase (probably the biggest of the millenial and Gen Z generations) and the media pretty much has adored him for over a decade by this point. So what Lebron's fanbase will do to make this not seem like a superteam is try to diminish his teammates by saying things like ""they've never been to the playoffs"" or ""they were only doing good because they were playing on a bad team"". As if that removes their talent and abilities. What does tend to happen with Lebron's superteam formula though, is that the Power Forward's (Chris Bosh & Kevin Love) scoring average gets reduces because Lebron partially takes over their role and turns them into spot up shooters. Power forwards tend to like to be closer to the rim to score and rebound. The guards are the secondary scorers generally (DeWayne Wade & Kyrie Irving)  As for this series, the only reason the Warriors had this series in their favor was because Kevin Love had a concussion (Kevin Love was a part of the core group of the Cavs). So instead of it being Lebron, Kyrie and Kevin Love, it was Lebron, Kyrie and Kevin Love who was at 25% of himself due to playing with a concussion for the series. The tandem of Kyrie and Lebron outscored Klay and Steph both times they played in a 7 games series against each other. Had Love never gotten that concussion, this series never goes the way it did as evidenced by Love's performance in the following 2 finals series.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

@TSwany,"Take me back to June 19, 2016... the greatest day of my life. Nine-year-old (and 3/4) me had witnessed true greatness that day. Earlier that day I had made some Scratch project and it got on the front page, I don't even know anymore, but needless to say, it was already a good day.    Now during the Finals game, I'm half-playing on a Minecraft server discussing the game, and half-watching said game.   I shut off my Minecraft game for this series, and boy, oh boy was it worth it. I was locked in at that point. That was the start of Quarter 4. I was watching the whole game, but I couldn't just multitask anymore.  Fast forward. 100% attention on the game. iPod on the kitchen counter. Entire family in the living room, no contact with the internet. Whatever happens, happens, And then, James hits a three. The game is tied,  89-89.    And it stays that way for two whole minutes, until...   ""Rebound taken by Iguodala!"" ""Iguodala to Curry, Back to Iguodala..""  I think to myself... Oh no. It's always right when i focus all of my attention that things fall apart...  But then...  ""Up for the layup--OH! BLOCKED BY JAMES! LEBRON JAMES WITH THE REJECTION!!""  My heart skips a beat and my legs collapse in pure amazement. I had just witnessed something superhuman. It had to have been God, disguised as LeBron James. No. This was real life.  Under 60 seconds after getting back up on my two feet, Kyrie is 1-on-1 with Curry. He's hesitating. He's going to go for that three. To quote Richard Jefferson from his Players' Tribune article, we had basically shared the same thoughts at that moment:  ... He's gonna ...  ... wait, is he gonna?  ... Oh f*** he's really gonna.  ... Oh f*** that went in!!!!!!!  Not just a three. A fadeaway three. There go my knees again, but this time, I fell backwards onto the couch. Stunning. Unbelievable. Clutch.   If anyone could make that shot, it was Kyrie, and only Kyrie. Call me crazy, but if I had a Finals MVP vote, it would have gone to Kyrie Irving. Kyrie. Irving.  The man whose name I'd recognized only from some old Cocoa Pebbles commercial a few years back when I'd started watching NBA basketball. I don't know why I knew that. But I can safely say that I ate Cocoa Pebbles every day for the following week after those finals.   But if we're going to talk names, I will not let you forget about Kevin Love. Ten seconds after Kyrie's game-winning shot.   ""Steph was trying to get open like his life was on the line, and Kevin was guarding him like his life was on the line.""   Ten seconds of lockdown defense later, Curry would brick a three. That was what sealed the game... and the series... and the season... and basketball immortality. Forty seconds later, it ends.   ""It's over! It's over! Cleveland is a city of champions once again! The Cavaliers are NBA champions!""  Fifty-two years of torment, and anguish... ...had been washed away.  That was it. The peak. The happiest I'd ever been. The happiest I'd ever be. Ever since, I have yet to feel happiness on a level even close to what I'd felt that night. It was something else. It was a miracle. It was magical.  It will always be cherished. And it will never be forgotten.   Because there will never ever be another Finals like it.",5년 전,0,

@sunnybrampton9206,"Man Looking back at all this Kyrie Irving wasn’t a great play maker and wasn’t a great defender by any means but one thing he was good at was getting that ball in the hoop, mesmerizing handles, acrobatic layups, heartbreaking side step shots for 3, a certified bucket getter. Idk if that’s a testament to what Lebron gets out of his teammates or how much of a natural talent kyrie is but one things for sure, when the media would ask Lebron about Irvings greatness after one of these monster games he would often say with befuddled look on his face “That kid special” and just laugh. That was so true I could be wrong but I never seen this kind of greatness from kyrie after he left Cleveland. He grew up and may have improved his game a bit as he got older but it wasn’t like those final 4 years in Cleveland. What he did to a young Klay Thompson and even Draymond in those years he should be behind bars for first degree murder. Now that he has set sail for Brooklyn to team up with KD trying to emulate what he had with Lebron it just makes me sad because if he stayed he could’ve went down as one of the greatest players when it was all said and done. Maybe even be the best person with the name Irving on the planet 🤔",5년 전(수정됨),43,

Warriors had a better team system and great chemistry. A legit championship quality team. But their loss to the Cavaliers isn't some sort of miracle, the Cavaliers had more than enough talent to win. Especially when Bogut got hurt, left the Warriors without a consistent rim protector. Draymond's suspension was a critical momentum swinger too, it created a lot of doubt and mental fatigue for the Warriors for game 5.    Once the Cavaliers took game 5, they had momentum on their side to win the next 2 games. Kyrie/Bron could attack the paint at will without Bogut in the rotation.",5년 전,0,

@kak3r0o,This is the Best NBA Title no doubt.  This can NEVER be duplicated EVER.  and here is Why!  1. 73 9 Team. That is hard to a complish  2 Cavs were down 3 1 fought back to win the Finals.  3. Game 7 on the Road.  That is why this ONLY championship for Cavs is Sweetest of All.,5년 전,6,
@jRanceh,"N!mble J4ck I agree in a way.  But Cleveland did have the best player in the world.  He led BOTH teams in rebounds, assist, and points.  Also, let’s be honest, the cavs would have handled GS the year before if it weren’t for injuries.  The Mavs had a team of misfits and players out of their prime and dominated the playoffs against all odds.  Also, you can’t credit Cleveland for being down 3-1.  To the Cavs credit, we would probably be arguing that GS team as the goat if it weren’t for them.  Coin toss, but I’m rolling with the Mavs incredible run and taking down a team of superstars with one all star.",5년 전,2,
@kak3r0o," @jRanceh    2011 is more likey will happen again in the future. They just like 2004 Pistons.   But 2016? I just dont think it will happen again EVER. and that what makes it SPECIAL & ONLY in the NBA Finals History.  2004 Pistons, 2011 Mavs & 2014 Spurs Teams were Remarkable & they were All Similar.  Now name a team that that is similar to Cavs 2016 & what they did?",5년 전,1,
@jRanceh,N!mble J4ck agreed...  but that Mavs team was even in question if they’d get out of the first round.  Then nobody gave them a chance against the 2 time defending Lakers in the 2nd round and the straight up SWEPT them.  Made quick work of the Thunder.  Against the heat they lost the first two games and were down by like 16 in the 4th of game 3 before they made a crazy comeback in the last 5 minutes.  Remember d wade and LeBron celebrating like they’d already won the championship?  Then..... something happened.  There wasn’t even a close game or miraculous comeback in that entire series until game 7.  Given the circumstances of Golden States record and them being down 3-1 it made a rather boring series seem more interesting.   I will say that the game 7 was probably the best finals game of the decade.  But they did have 3 All stars on top the best player in the world.  The Mavs had Dirk and Jason Terry and took down probably the best team on paper ever to that point.  Nothing like that will ever happen again.  I’m going to guess if you would have picked the Mavs to win that championship in Vegas you would have made a lot of money that year.,5년 전,1,
@kak3r0o," @jRanceh    Mavs like team is most likely to happen again in the future & as a matter of fact it happened in 2004 with Pistons & 2014 in Spurs. I am pretty much sure it willbhappen again in the future.  But The Cavs 2016? That team championship is once in a lifetime.  Now tell me in the past if there was or were a Team like the Cavs? And in order for teams to beat that record is that some team has to be a Juggernaut Team again with 74 8 record, u have to be down 3 1 and win it on the Road in Game 7.  More realistic debate here is which one has sweeter title? The 2004 pistons or 2011 Mavs? Just disregard the 2014 Spurs. LoL  My answer is Pistons 2004.",5년 전(수정됨),1,

Against the best NBA record of all time. 3. Ended Cleveland Cavs championship drought (as well as for sports in Northern Ohio in general). I think it was 50 years. 4.

@christianhenry4173," @RyanRapid  Heavens no. LeBron's had great competition but he's had way too much help more then Kobe and he maybe the better overall player but let's be honest here that finals record is supposed to prove he's near Jordan but he's not he's a peak near Jerry West and I'm tired of seeing the media skipping LeBron over Bill Russel, Wilt Chamberlain, Hakeem, Tim Duncan, Shaq, Kobe etc. Let's be honest how can we skip LeBron over Tim Duncan when his record is 3-6 and not 5-0 or 6-3 he's not near Jordan! He's not Near Wilt or Bill Russel. Is he top 5 in stats? Yes but greatest of all time? What measures outside of career longevity are we comparing players to LeBron ? He's not a top scorer he just has more records of atleast 30 ppg. He's not top 5 in scoring titles, he's definitely not 5 as a defensive player he's only had 1 defensive season of 2013 and he's overrated in defense, low shooting percentage in freethrows, Most missed playoff shots while leading 3 teams to playoffs. #2 right now on top turnovers of all time and that's just as bad as Kobe having most missed shots in history but do we mention that for LeBron?

@levirain6011,its funny how all those players you mentioned had better teammates than lebron james ever did and the greatest coaches phil jackson 11 rings greg popovich 5 rings . Pat riiley 5 or more . Lebron james has surpassed all those players in game he proved it last year alone Vs warriors 5 all star team.I want to see another player make  8 finals in a row if its easy .Kobe Bryan said he rather play with lebron and his last interview he didn’t respond to who is the greatest of all time question. When coach Phil Jackson came to L.A. with kobe and shak they won 3 nba finals in a row. jordan bulls would have no chance against those lakers. Even if he didn’t retired there was no stopping those lakers. Jordan never made finals without coach Phil Jackson. Never eliminated larry birds celtics in playoffs never made playoffs with the wizards. The other players played in jordan era most of those players are just a hater of lebron like Charles Barkley bum ass even the media are tired of him talking shit on lebron. todays nba players more than half say Lebron is already the greatest of all time . The game keeps evolving and players are more atlthletic and talented now . When was there a player like Steph curry who scores 400 plus 3s per year . Lebron is the greatest player of all time. He will prove it. Hes not done .,6년 전,1,

I bet if your favorite team had multiple all-stars that won in the NBA finals a couple of times, you wouldn't give a shit and those rings wouldn't be ""meaningless"" to you.",6년 전,0,
@TheSilverwolf1001,"Okay then let’s talk about FACTS GSW was a better team overall in the 4-0 sweep against the Cavs that season. They had Kevin Durant who is regarded as one of the best basket ball players as well as curry and his crew. You are forgetting that fact and letting it misguide that GSW was expected to win because they had way better talent so in regards to that the sweep wasn’t that bad compared to the 3-1 sweep. Draymond didn’t even need to play like an all-star because of the fact others on his team would pick up the pace or out-perform as well Kevin Durant and draymond never got along. Here’s another Fact, Kyrie Irving wanted to be the numero uno franchise player of the Cavs which he couldn’t become that because Lebron James was their. He left the team to be a teams franchised player for the Celtics AKA their number one player.   Now let me explain why the sweep wasn’t that bad compared to the 3-1 comeback. GSW had to win only 1 Game for them to be champions compared to the CAVS 3. The fact that GSW lost all 3 games and couldn’t Close the series is utterly bad. It means that you performed so bad That you lost your rythm to finish the series.   The 4-0 sweep wasn’t bad because GSW was expected to win by every sports analyst you could find from sport center to Fox. Despite what you say GSW performance during the Finals was above all the teams who played during the time.  These are Facts. You can look up the highlights and you can even look up video’s to see whose more favored to win. As well as why the 4-0 sweep wasn’t as surprising. When you look up anylitical reviews and comments about the 3-1 come back you see that it is more surprising because the CAVS in all intent and purposes wasn’t favored to win. It is why it is one of the greatest comebacks in history. Thank you for reading.",6년 전,1,
@BeastDaniell," @TheSilverwolf1001  Kyrie had almost nothing to do with this discussion so I don't know why you're bringing him up.  Who said Draymond needed to play like an all-star? I said he wasn't playing like an all-star in response to you guys' excuse of ""It took 4 all-stars to beat one man."" Which doesn't even make sense.   Just because many people expected the Warriors to beat the Cavs in the 2016 finals, and then ultimately lose to them in game 7, it doesn't make choking a 3-1 lead worst than getting swept 4-0. You mentioning GSW having KD and Steph is just a fancy way of saying: They have a well built team unlike Cleveland. Getting swept is worst than blowing a lead because you LOST 4 games IN A ROW while not winning a single game.  Wanna talk facts? It didn't take 4 all-stars (Really 3 but I'll say 4 according to you guys) to sweep one man. It took a good and well built team to sweep one man with a shitty garbage ass team.",6년 전,0,
@janrenztamayo1800," @BeastDaniell  bruh you're the bias one. defending GS team after they lose 2 1/2 years ago? come on man. it's just a game where NBA players doing their part as a player, stop arguing about it. stop saying that bullshit. no excuse CAVS beat GS, GS beat CAVS. that's it",6년 전,2,
@BeastDaniell, @janrenztamayo1800  Excuses? That ironic because that what some of you guys are making in this comment thread. What excuses am I even making? And how am I even bias? All I was trying to say is that blowing a lead isn't as bad as getting swept. If that's bias then I don't what is.

@BeastDaniell,"@Tyler Pallotta I actually do know what it is, thank you. Telling me what you rather do is a fallacy. Doing that and making bad excuses doesn't prove that blowing a lead is worst than getting swept.   That ""Broken Hand"" excuse came up right after GSW beat the Cavaliers. If it was the other way around, LeBron would of never mentioned it.   As for the cavs ""getting robbed,"" LeBron gets away with the wrost travels and the refs never call for them. So that's not a good excuse.",6년 전(수정됨),0,
@BeastDaniell,"@Tyler Pallotta You keep telling me the number of games GS won and lost like it's supposed to mean something. I've just told you it doesn't matter how many good players are on a specific team and doesn't matter how many games they won. That has nothing to do with losing a 7 game series. I'm stupid but you don't pay attention to what I say. You can insult me all day but it still won't help your pathetic argument.  Again, the Broken hand excuse doesn't work. Why all of sudden it came to that when the Warriors beat the Cavs in the finals?   It's true that they need better Refs but don't act like GS is the only team that got away with something without it being called for. LeBron James and James Harden gets away with so many travels.  Cavs getting robbed is debatable but they've still got swept. I already proved that getting swept is worst than blowing a lead. That's a fact whether you accept it or not.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

Yes, Kyrie deserved massive credit here, but you have to keep a few things in mind I think. LeBron was the main star and leader of the team, no question. He's from Ohio so winning this title was even more special for him personally in that sense and also a major, and pretty awesome, storyline. He was also finals MVP leading both teams in virtually every category. So of course the media is going to focus on LeBron far more. I'm sure Kyrie was celebrating here too they just didn't show him as much due to all of the above factors.",7년 전,0,

Kyrie was traded without knowing, let's end this Kyrie closed the game, those guys worked together with the rest of their team.

Draymond is the real issue crying and texting KD to come to GS to save them from LeBrons wrath. Whatever is said about LeBron underachieving or for starting something that started with Jordan, Pipen, and Rodman. LeBron only had big 3's. GS has an all star 5.

Pat riiley 5 or more . Lebron james has surpassed all those players in game he proved it last year alone Vs warriors 5 all star team.I want to see another player make  8 finals in a row if its easy .Kobe Bryan said he rather play with lebron and his last interview he didn’t respond to who is the greatest of all time question. When coach Phil Jackson came to L.A. with kobe and shak they won 3 nba finals in a row. jordan bulls would have no chance against those lakers. Even if he didn’t retired there was no stopping those lakers. Jordan never made finals without coach Phil Jackson. Never eliminated larry birds celtics in playoffs never made playoffs with the wizards. The other players played in jordan era most of those players are just a hater of lebron like Charles Barkley bum ass even the media are tired of him talking shit on lebron. todays nba players more than half say Lebron is already the greatest of all time . The game keeps evolving and players are more atlthletic and talented now . When was there a player like Steph curry who scores 400 plus 3s per year . Lebron is the greatest player of all time.

Kyrie is only going to get better, and after seeing those sweet finishes at the rim, and the big shot to seal the game up, I can say with pretty good certainty that he can be a hall of fame player if he stays healthy, continues to work hard and plays with the intelligence and athleticism he demonstrated during the finals.",9년 전,417,

@champgodwingalvez3298,"Watching from 2018, Lebron is the GOAT and anybody who says otherwise doesnt understand  basketball and fails to see all the things the king has done throughout his career. Look at this game lebron was like a barrier on the rim...he is a bigger stronger and smarter michael jordan...amazing basketball IQ",7년 전,0,
@ravenvixen2402,"I rank Lebron over Jordan since sometime during the 2016-2017 season.  He was able to beat the Warriors with the league rules and the bogus refs, that counts as a 3peat or 4 titles in itself: ) Only leading player to defeat a 70 win team ) Only leading player to win game 7 on the road in the competitive modern eras (ie, since the 60s Celtics)  ) Only leading player to come back from 3-1 ) Only player to conquer all statistical categories in the finals ) If nothing else, He brought the city of Cleveland an NBA Championship, ended the curse, and ended the 52 year drought  But individually,  aside from accomplishments, his game evolved to a new level that Jordan never touched.  And his game was so effective and impressive without having to score more than a few baskets... BUT HE STILL PROVED HE CAN GET A 30 POINT TRIPLE DOUBLE ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT. To me, he reached ""GOAT"" STATUS by the middle of the season, and by the time the finals was over he certianly cemented he was greater than Jordan.  But to me, picking one single player as the best of greatest ever is a farce or myth.  I simply like the idea of Mount Rushmore where the top 5 or 6 are placed for the combination of individual greatness as well as achievements.  Between Jordan and Lebron... Jordan is better because he made it look better Lebron is greater because he made it look easier Kareem is truly THE GOAT, because he dominated way before the NBA and all the way til his retirement, and he was just unstoppable.  His numbers and accomplishments coupled with his physicality are head and shoulders above all else.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@UzumakiShell,"Ray Mad You're an idiot if you think no one can guard Kyrie. My original comment was just a little smack talk, but since you want to get serious then let's do it.   No one can guard Kyrie? Let's explore that. He averaged 19 points a game this season and only had 4.7 assists. He's purely a scoring pg, so him only averaging that much isn't good at all. Kyrie was a fucking beast, but the only reason be was scoring like that is because the warriors has someone else to focus on, LeBron. Of you honestly think Kyrie played so well because ""he realized no one can guard him"" then you don't know anything about the game of basketball. He only scored that way because LeBron took care of everything Kyrie should have been doing as a pg, and allowed Kyrie to focus purely on scoring. Saying ""no one could guard him"" shows just how little you know about the game of basketball.  Don't pick fights you can't win young blood",9년 전,56,

I think great player got thier rings because he love his team and make rings in his only Mother team... like magic johnson, lary bird, and michael jordan... they made and got thier rings in thier mother teams... no more no less😂😂😂 but this dud!!! He doesent know what team he my be eased... and more than that, he never get rings if he who play with the team... he always want powerful team mates thats why he have rings... but in real??? He never get some ring if hes not famous and heard by nva officials... cavs, irving love thompson and smith. Got ring!!! Miami, chris bosh and dwane wade 2 of the moat power in nba. Got rings!!! Then now??? Los angels lakera all star cast added by  antonio davis... he got his last ring for now... questuon is??? All, all time and franchise player got thier ring and did not leave thier teams like late kobe bryant got his all rings in lakers, and his greatness michael jordan took his 6 rings in bulls... just!!! Is'nt it thus days basketball is what you called is for fotune??? Because before basketball is a team and build and mold with its coach for long time so that they called that team... but now with le bron basketbal is just fuckin busyness and a comedial nor comedy games like cartoons...😂😂😂 no heart no guts no goal but just a simple money game... love to watch older nba game rather watch nba games this days...",4년 전,0,

@bsiffy,"GSW were a one hit wonder. Curry did not play ONE SINGLE HEALTHY POINT GUARD in 2015 playoffs, not to mention they avoided BOTH OKC and SA. Then once GSW got to the Finals (after beating Houston LOL) they faced a Kyrie/Love-less Cavs team and won in 6. With something to prove, they treated all 82 regular season games like a Game 7 in 2016, whereas teams like Cleveland, OKC, SA rested players on occasion. GSW went down 3-1 to OKC (after they avoided the LAC who I think would have beat the Warriors, but BG/CP3 both got hurt). I give them huge credit for coming back down in that series from 3-1...but you have to admit that OKC blew that series big time. With free agency coming up it doesn't look like GSW will bring back a few players and I believe Durant is a lock to stay with OKC after that Magic trade that happened last night. I put an asterisk on their title, 73 wins, unanimous MVP (that went 1-6 in 4Q of NBA Finals Game 7), and their organization for thinking they were ""light years ahead"" of all other organizations in the NBA.

What about those years with the Miami Heat where he had 2 future HOF players in their prime on his team along with terrific shooters like Ray Allen, Mario Chalmers(In his prime), and Shane Battier. I guess according to them, those players never existed for getting him to 4 NBA finals and winning 2 of them. Without those guys, Lebron has technically only won 1 championship!  Also Lebron should not be in same sentence with any of the all time greats for playing his whole career in the eastern conference in an era where the East has been MEGAWEAK outside of the 3 years that the Celtics and the Magic were ruling the East.

@jordandwiggins1026,"This comment section has this bizarre frequent occurrence where people think that underdog means that you have to have like no chance of winning and still win anyway. But that’s ridiculous, it’s just a term to compare different teams. Obviously those Cavs weren’t underdogs compared to most teams in the league, and nobody is saying they were. But they were underdogs to the Warriors because the Warriors won way more games, had never lost twice at home all year, had the unanimous MVP and went up 3-1. In that series the Cavs were unquestionably underdogs as compared to the Warriors, and that’s all that matters here. SAS said they had 0 chance after just game 2. Saying they weren’t underdogs because they had a good chance at winning compared to other teams besides the Warriors is like saying that 9 is not a lesser number than 10 because 9 isn’t as as low as 4. That’s not how this works. 9 can be greater than every number below it and STILL be less than 10, just as the Cavs can be one of the best teams in the league and STILL be underdogs compared to the Warriors. Nearly every fan and sports analyst in the country would have picked the Warriors to win that series, so by definition, the Cavs were underdogs in that particular series.  Not underdogs compared to the majority of the league, but still underdogs compared to the Warriors. Anyone who claims otherwise is just speaking nonsense.  I’m not here to start up an argument or attack people or call people stupid, I’m just here to say my piece and leave. I appreciate the person here who was admitting that they were being irrational a few years ago, that’s a mature thing to do and I have no intention of dragging you into another debate, I just want to clarify something for anyone reading this who doesn’t understand what the term underdog means.",5년 전,1,

After spending 8 seasons with the team that he almost single handedly brought to relevance, he wins a championship and his team becomes the first to overcome a 1-3 deficit in the NBA finals and the only team since 1978 to win a finals game 7 on the road.

It doesn't change anything. And if you happen to think that the Warriors were better than the Cavs last season because they won, you're wrong. They won because almost every Cavs player was out with injury or playing injured last time around. Curry is a great shooter.

@JohnSmith-tx5xq,+Is S actually this dude is right Bogut is a defensive monster and is a shot blocking big with Bogut on the floor Lebron was quite pathetic Bogut blocks Bogut can get 10 easy points with lob dunks and Bogut dominates Tristan Thompson so with Bogut that's like plus 10 points minutes 6 from Lebron minus like 4 from kyrie and minus like half of Tristan Thompson points and adds rebound control if Bogut and draymond are both on the floor warriors are the best team by far that combination has not let warriors down if draymond got Suspended a different game like game 4 than 5 we would have a combination of Bogut and draymond but after game 4 we never had te two on the floor at the same time just admit it both of Thais guys in the floor no one in the nba can beat us and Bogut is a beast centre the only better centre I can think of is Steven Adams so game 7 warriors win by like 14 with Bogut on the floor and Lebron has a 20 point game and btw all you idiots saying Lebron led in everything if,9년 전,1,

But watching the way the Cavaliers players reacted to their Finals win  after time expired shows me they wanted it more badly then the Warriors. The Warriors deserve to lose the Finals because of their lack of urgency and sloppy play. Watching the way the Warriors showed up in Game 3, especially Steph Curry, was a disrespect to his teammates,  his MVP award, his fan, and his opponent.   Secondly, I think Steve Kerr is an average coach who isn't able to make adjustments  during the game. Only seems to make adjustments after watching the game on film.

Lebron brought the Heat to 4 straight Finals and won 2 of them. He returned to Cleveland and brought them to 2 consecutive Finals and winning one of them against all odds, down 3-1 and defeated a top 5 team in the history of the NBA. I love Jordan but his impact on his team is barely noticeable (they only lost 2 more games without him) which goes to show that Jordan a much better supporting cast than Lebron ever did. Lebron also had alot more on his shoulders. He had to defend, make plays, grab rebounds and score. All Jordan ever had to do was score. Pippen and Rodman are the 2 best defenders ever and Rodman is the best rebounder ever. Im not saying that Lebron is better but im just saying that Jordan is not miles ahead of Lebron like many people seem to think. Both of them are GOATS.

That's absolutely ridiculous.  -The reason I say rounded was because averaging a triple double does not mean you got a triple double every game, I think LeBron only had a triple double 2 or 3 of the games this year, one being game 3 and the other being game 7, though he probably did another game.  -LeBron is the first to be top 10 in playoff points, assists, and rebounds.  -LeBron, if he goes absolutely insane the next couple seasons, has a pretty good chance to have the second or even first highest points in NBA history.  -LeBron is the first person to lead both teams in every stat for an entire finals.  -LeBron did all of this against the greatest team ever (record wise), the greatest three point shooter ever (who also happens to be the first unanimous season MVP ever), the two winningest coaches by percentage in Walton and Kerr (who, though they were role players, were on championship teams with two other greats, namely Jordan and Kobe). He literally had all the odds stacked against him.  -LeBron is the first star to truly live up to the hype. He has been hyped by the media since he was in highschool, and he has not dissapointed.  -LeBron is one of the few stars who has carried absolute garbage teams to the finals, Iverson being another notable one. Jordan could not do that.  -LeBron's kids have way more potential to be great than Jordan's kids ever had, and where are Jordan's kids now?  -Why do I mention LeBron's kids? He is the first star whose kids have a huge chance to become stars in the future. Why? Because he has not put pressure on them to be like him. Bryce James' favorite player is Curry. LeBron Jr.'s fave is Westbrook. This lessens the pressure on his kids to live up to their father's name, which is good, because that means they'll be better off.  -LeBron is the first player who left his hometown team because the organization was trash, became the most hated athlete in America and second only to probably Ronaldo (and Ronaldo deserves hate way more than LeBron), and then returned to win a ring for the former fans that now hated him.  -Let me add this: he won the ring. And it wasn't just any town he won it for. He won it for freaking Cleveland.  -FINALLY: LeBron is the first star to never be caught in a major scandal. Kobe had the rape allegations/relationship troubles. Jordan was addicted to gambling. If social media was like it is now back when they played they would have been destroyed.  LeBron definitely touches Jordan, people always knew he'd be great and he lived up to that. He is closer to being like Jordan than any other player in NBA history. LeBron was never carried in a finals that he won, and he was only carried in one finals that he lost (vs the Mavs).",9년 전,0,

He scored 25 points in a 4th quarter against the tough Pistons of the early to mid 2000's.

@TupacolypseNow,Jarret Berenson i dont care about kobe. Kobe isnt a better than magic or Bird.  Lebron james is not better than bird and definately not better than Magic.  just look at their statlines.. then look at the way they play.  we don't need to compare rings and mvps they all have their fare share of those. that doesn't prove whose better on the court.  lebron james doesn't even shoot 76% from the freethrow line.. how can he be better than larry bird who shot 50 40 90? larry bird only avged one less assist and larry doesnt run the point position like lebron... do you understand what that means? that means larry bird is a better passer too. and just watch larry's games you'll see why i say hes a better passer.. lebron is a good passer too. but larry is better. lebron averaged 3 more points per game.  and youll realize and see that lebrons averages will go down as he continues to play more games.  larry bird in his prime is better than lebron james in his prime.  dont get me started on magic. 20 12 and 7.. 85% from the free throw and shooting over 50% which is better fg% than lebron.  lebron scores a little more thats all.. magic and larry are better all around players.,9년 전,0,

@TupacolypseNow,"83jdc1  if you compare lebron to jordan, magic and, larry.  lebron has the worst ball handles. He's the worst shooter. he's the worst ft shooter. okay ill accept that lebron ball handling is the same level as birds. not very good.  jordan beats him in points. Larry beats him in rebounds. Magic beats him in assists.  lebron scores more than magic by 7 ppg and thats the only stat he does better except for maybe blocks lol.  larry only avgs 1 less assist and 3 points.  larry magic and jordan are all super clutch players which lebron is not.  you could say lebron is a better passer than jordan but jordan did not look to make plays. he passed at the right times when he needed too. and the season that jordan played pg he averaged 32 8 and 8 or something. so honestly lebron isnt a better passer.  lebron is not a better passer than bird or magic.  lebron is not the first or second best player of all time.",9년 전,0,
@jarretberenson1214,"+TupacolypseNow Just so u know, LeBron in his prime shot 57% and 40%. Bird was never this efficient. Like u said LeBron was a better scorer. He did average more assists, than Bird and did not usually bring the ball up. Mario and Wade did that more often. LeBron and Bird are both excellent passers, but I would say LeBron is better. Both are similar rebounders but Bird has the edge.  Defense goes to LeBron although Bird was a good defender. LeBron can guard anyone in the league and has more appearances on the all defense team (Bird never made they first team). So this gives Passing (call it a tie because we disagree) to no one, and rebounding to Bird. However LeBron is better at scoring and defense making him better. As for clutch was, the most recent NBA finals showed LeBron had plenty, although Bird gets the edge. However, Rebounding and clutch mess are not nearly as important as defense and scoring. So LeBron is the overall winner.",9년 전,0,
@jarretberenson1214,"+TupacolypseNow As for Magic, there is no doubt that he is the better passer.. However, LeBron wins at scoring, rebounding, and defense. Don't forget about Tragic Johnson, so the amount of clutch is comparable for both of these players. Surprisingly, James is actually a better 3 point shooter than Johnson. Although Johnson was slightly more efficient on field goals which makes sense because he took less shots. This one is more lopsided than Bird. LeBron wins again.",9년 전,0,
@jarretberenson1214,"+TupacolypseNow Although I must admit, that u finally made a good argument using valid evidence, so I have to respect that.

@TupacolypseNow,"Jarret Berenson​ I really appreciate your manner of discussing with me.  I agree that in lebrons prime his fg% was excellent.   If we disregard career stats and take the players primes I have to give it to Larry.   Because Larry was shooting like 52% which is less than LeBron but still good. But at the same time bird was shooting over 90% from the ft whereas LeBron ft% is a sub-optimal sub 80%, like 75%. And scoring is relatively close with a few points in lebrons favor.  And I wouldn't say LeBron is a better rebounder than magic because magic avg 7 rbpg.  Lebrons only real advantage over Larry and magic is a few ppg the way I see it. I think those two are better assets to have than a hybrid type player like LeBron.",9년 전,0,
@jarretberenson1214,"+TupacolypseNow I feel like you are undervaluing defense. In my view, it is just as important as offense. That is the main reason that I put James per Bird. If James tried his hardest (I acknowledge that he only does this in the Finals) on defense, I think that he would win defensive player of the year. I also don't value free throw percentage as much as you. To me, a 5% difference in field goal percentage is far more substantial than a 15% increase in field goal percentage (this was the case if u compare James and Bird during their best seasons). You may feel differently tho. I was also wrong about James being a better rebounder than Johnson. I just made an assumption without checking the numbers. They are equals at that aspect. I appreciate your reasoning too. I feel like we are both making arguments based on statistics and sound reasoning.",9년 전,0,
@TupacolypseNow,Jarret Berenson I agree. U may have a point about fg% and LeBron being a defensive monster.  I guess I take some credit away from LeBron because I rarely see him try his best.  Whereas it seemed like those guys put their heart out on the court every night.  I kno there were times when I liked LeBron and gave him full credit when I felt like he was going all out. And because I don't see that often I don't want to say he's as good as I think he would be if he had more passion.  Either way when it's all said and done LeBron will go down as one of the best to do it.,9년 전,0,

Green was becoming Mr Loudmouth. His good games are as numerous as his bad playoff time. Who is the one crying. Last Thompson who disappear in game 7, claim GSW better than Showtime Lakers ?   73-9 is nothing without a ring. Leading 3-1 and losing it is a meltdown. Seriously, even if they won it how many times GSW lost by double digits. Not 10 points but 20-30 points. 95 96 Bulls had one in New York by 30 that was it.",9년 전,268,

@Newyorksmostwanted1,"CURRY HAS BEEN EXPOSED!  Now I don't want to hear that Curry was injured. HE WAS EXPOSED! Remember how last year their championship run was very smooth. Big part of it was that Curry didn't face any point guards that year that could make him work on both ends of the floor.  Last years guards:   Jrue Holiday - Injured but played in 3 of the 4 games, was not a factor. He had to deal with Norris cole  Mike Conley - Injury, Gave them a little scare but wasn't 100%  Patrick Beverly - Defensive minded but not really a defensive player. Just very physical.  This years guards:  Patrick Beverly -  ^^ Irrelevant   Damian Lillard - Was torching in the regular season and was doing it on the offensive end in the playoffs when he came back from injury. We all know what Dame Dolla can do.  Russell Westbrook - Man oh man. Should I have to explain what kind of monster he is? We're talking about the most explosive player in the league and you know thats another reason why curry had trouble with this team because he was exposing him. We know Russell tends to be out of control and takes bad shots or turns the ball over but The thunder were giving them a run for their money.  Kyrie Irving: Simply outplayed curry this whole series if you tend to watch all of the finals. you'd know. But anywas check this out - 9:11  Now if you want to blame it on injuries we can say that about last year when they cavs had no where to go but lebron LeBron LEBRON.

And once they won game 5 & then 6 especially the way they won it, holding off the late warrior change and Lebron with the epic block/shit talking to steph, I was legit on board with the notion they'd pull off that historic comeback, and thank the gods they didn't let me down...

Finishing the regular season with a historic NBA record of 73-9 in amazing. Lebron is the best player in the NBA in the past 10 years but I somehow don't see him winning 6 titles back to back like Jordan did because I see that as something that we won't ever see again.

He just got caught into shooting threes and relied on perimeter work and headfakes when thats not his game.  there was times in game 7 where without love, the team doesnt get some of the DEFENSIVE rebounds, he was that aggresive on the boards. He set a tone in the first quarter by being aggresive on the boards . When Kevin love plays well, cavaliers are almost impossible to beat cause it sets tone for everybody else,",9년 전,0,
@PowerGPUpcs,wow really K love had amazing D in this game and had 15 rebounds. they had 15 second chance points. think about that if he would have only gotten half that they would have lost. he is a superstar. everybody here saying klove should be traded has a low bball IQ.,9년 전,0,

Wilt is the best defending big man in the history of the game, Kareem and Russell have both said that. If you have a guy who on the offensive side of things who demands a double team at least at all times but still scores at will, opens up shots for the whole team, and grabs a ridiculous amount of offensive rebounds, and then on the defensive side of things stops basically any scoring in the paint and shuts down the opposing center and stops nearly all offensive boards...

Shaq shut down Jordan and the Bulls in the 95 playoffs when he was still on the Orlando Magic when the Bulls were in beast mode! I'm sorry but, that's something Wilt and the 72 lakers could never do. And, Wilt was only 275 lbs. not ""well over 300lbs."" Shaq on the other hand, was. He was 325 lbs. Shaq would break the glass dunking on Wilt.",9년 전,0,
@Larry_Suave,"16kings You're a fucking idiot, and an insult to the nba community. Wilt was 275 lbs when he was on the sixers, on the lakers he weighed 310 lbs of muscle. He benched 465 lbs in front of a crowd when he was fucking 60 years old. In other words he was far stronger than shaq. He also ran a sub 11 second 100 meter dash, which makes him faster than lebron james. A 7'1, 300 lb big man of pure muscle with the speed and agility of a track star the strength of an olympic weightlifter and the will to win of a champion. Sorry kid, but any fantasies you have of wilt and other players in the 60's being inferior are pure bullshit.",9년 전,0,
@16kings,"+TheBrother171 Look here crack head. 465 is not even anywhere near ""Olympic"" caliber weightlifting. Shaq routinely benched 450 2x10 as part of his training regimen in LA. He could absolutely bench 500+. And Lebron was clocked running 20mph sprints on sports science, which translates to an 11.1 second 100 meter dash. And, if you want to talk about the will of a champion, I guess Shaq willed himself to twice as many rings. The players in the 60s were 100% inferior. You can tell that much just by LOOKING at them. They had absolutely no fluidity, they were stiff as a board. Like their legs were made out of wood. Telegraphing every shot, pass, or movement. They didn't get proper training, or nutrition. And it showed. Your entire argument is invalid.",9년 전,0,

He would be pretty much exactly like elgin baylor, who was great but not as good as wilt.  If wilt was in the current nba the absolute least he would average is 35 and 15. What center is gonna stop him from grabbing every rebound?  He lost in the finals because the celtics had the most loaded roster in the history of basketball.

I'll take LARRY THE LEGEND,9년 전,0,

He fills so many categories on the statsheet, like Lebron likes to do. Curry's threat of offense opens up so many options and allows the team to work. The Warriors just lost a few crucial pieces along the way at different times during the finals and it culminated and exposed them in game 7.   They got beat on the boards all series. Bogut getting hurt didn't help. Their interior defense suffered, they lost second chance points off tapbacks, they lost their best passing big man. Kerr had to cycle between Festus and Varejao and they were mostly terrible.  Barnes was just horrible. He had to step up on the rebounding and defense with Bogut gone but was mostly a non-factor there and a liability on offense.  Draymond hit Lebron in the balls and got suspended for game 5, the same game where Bogut got hurt.
