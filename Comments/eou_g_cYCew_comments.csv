Setting an alphanumeric code or fingerprint to prevent the device from being turned off when locked. 2. With your Mi Account, using the Find My Device feature (similar to Apple’s Find My iPhone) to locate, lock, or erase your phone if it’s lost or stolen. 3. Leveraging offline finding, which uses a Bluetooth-based peer-to-peer network so nearby Xiaomi devices can detect your phone and securely send its location to Xiaomi servers, helping track devices even with no signal. 4. Registering family members’ Xiaomi devices in your Mi Account to safely track their locations (and vice versa) while online or offline, while keeping the information encrypted and visible only to authorized users. 5. Adding an extra layer of security with ""Google Lock"" and ""Find my device"" feature which protects your device, Google account and services.",3주 전(수정됨),0,

I use an iPhone, and one thing about iPhone users is they don’t give a f- about android phones, while android fans are OBSESSED with iPhones. The only reason I’ve come to this comment section is because I was watching a video about xiaomi suing their customers for negative feedback online. Buyers of their cars and phones. Tons of quality issues and lack of support for these issues. Instead of taking the feedback and improving their products, they sue their customers. People claim that apple hates their customers, but they at least take the criticism on the chin and make improvements.

Would it not do away with any upsides the product might have? This is a terrible example of a product from a country where copyright does not exist and Apple is more interested in gaining access to that small percentage making money than pressing charges against a company in what is clearly a lost cause.

@PopFamilyTTV,"Hi community, Hi Marq. I know this video I`m talking about is a 2 years old video, but is related to this video and many others of yours , where I have a completely different opinion and i strongly disagree with conclusion you got there. You said in the past "" power user features, as much as we love`em, don`t sell phones"" also you said "" We figured this our many times when LG, Sony, Asus Zenphone try to bring in this features are not selling."" My opinion is that features in this case are not a contributory factor to NOT selling the phones, nor the efforts to create something different. The problem is THE NAME of this brands, and is not even the brands fault, is the consumer. We live in a time where we are surrounded by consumerism, sheep effect, mass media control and all of that, and what I am trying to say with this is , if a big amount of people are buying Samsung and Iphone, because of the sheep effect (majority not thinking for themselves and not willing to be original and take their own choices/decisions in term of what represents them, they will just go for what the others do, which is Samsung and Iphone, and that is how in present that became the TREND , the majority. Basically all the other brands are surviving on minority which is day by day smaller, and like I said, majority of people are switching for Samsung / Iphone, but the same people don't have a clue why they buy this brands/phones. They just do because the next door did the same, and so on. Are a lot of brands and phones out there, which may fulfil the needs of a lot of people, better than samsung / iphone for the price. People which need stronger battery and good camera good overall specs, but for less money, which obviously Iphone cant offer. People which need better camera but they would like something more unique in the same time and not that pricy , which obviously Samsung cant offer, but the other brands you mentioned are slowly dying, because of lack of originality. Again, majority will chose to get  Iphone or Samsung regardless, only because of thinking "" what if my work colleague see I bought an Oneplus, some people dont even know Oneplus makes phones, they all have iphones"" , and etc. That is the real reason why this brands are dying, because majority become day by day fake, trend, sheep controlled.

I hate the xiaomi stock UI so much and there's so much bloatware garbage installed by default, but other than that I think it's really raised my standards for what a phone should be able to do. The phone is still working absolutely fine 4 years on, the only sign of age is the battery depletes extremely fast in cold weather (or at least says it does, I know it's a common thing for phones to misrepresent the battery remaining when it's cold just by how they work normally) but in comfortable temperatures it's still faster and lasts longer than my pixel. The rest of the hardware is great too, plastic back but I'll always have a case on it. Still has an aux port and expandable storage too. Camera doesn't hold a candle to the pixel but still far far outclasses the Motorola I used before the xiaomi and is generally good enough for everything I want it to do. Oh and this wasn't even their flagship model, this was all in a low-mid range model that cost the same new as the refurbished 2 gen old pro model pixel I got. Oh and as a bonus, the charger that came with it for free is better than the official pixel charger which you have to buy separately.",4주 전,0,

@clwx_gusion,"why buy a crappy android when u have the real deal? androids always out-specs iphones on paper because thats quite literally their only attraction. Like it or not Ios provides a unique, compact, elegant design compared to androids. Trust me, i've used the s23 ultra in the past. Android nerds say ""oh its more customizable"" yeah sure but it's so weird or maybe its just my ocd but when i downloaded widgets it just fit so weird and the spacing between apps and the widget is just so odd, the worst part is i cant change that - i can only increase the number of apps on each page. Theres just so many well-thought out details in the ios that provides the ""luxurious"" feeling to apple compared to other android phones when really they are of the same pricing, sometimes android being even more expensive (s25 ultra). The convenience of swiping to exit something in most social media apps is just great. Don't get me wrong though, high end androids are still amazing but like they share the same software system as those low end crappy phones so no matter how good, say for example, samsung is, i just feel like the android thing just throws it off. I wish more companies created their own software, just like how apple has done. I feel like i would like samsung more if they had a S25 ultra that is of the size of iphone and is not a literal square block that is big and bulky to carry around.",4주 전,0,

@easycompzeelandold2521,"Assumption: the primary 6-ish″ LTPO AMOLED is the main power sink (more pixels, higher peak brightness, higher touch/refresh ceilings). In that case, offloading “quick tasks” to the rear display makes sense: fewer active pixels and lower nits generally mean less panel power. For gaming it depends: you only get real savings if the game actually renders at the rear display’s native resolution/refresh. If it’s a straight mirror of the main UI, the GPU/SoC workload (fill rate, compositing) is similar, so battery benefit will be limited. Practical use-cases where the back screen should shine: camera preview/shutter, turn-by-turn glances, music/podcast controls, authenticator codes, payments, and always-on widgets. Curious if Xiaomi exposes per-app targeting for the rear panel on the 17 Pro.",4주 전,0,

@ofermaor,"I'm a little surprised, Marques, that you fall into the ""Android spec"" superiority as an advantage. Yes, iPhone 17 Pro Max has ""only"" 5000mah battery while the Xiaomi Pro Max has 7500! A whopping 50% improvement. Only real world tests show that they perform on par - i.e. they both maintain the same amount of battery over the same amount of effort - simply because iPhone is FAR more efficient - A19 is more efficient than snapdragon elite, and overall the iOS optimization is. Should I continue? The new snapdragon may finally have benchmarks that are keeping up with Apple, but the actual performance you would get in an android ecosystem will be somewhat lower (albeit still fast enough - all new chips are fast enough :)). Cameras may be 50mp vs 48mp (who cares) but are they really better? iPhone 17 pro max scored the highest DxO score outside of the ""scary"" camera-unbalanaced phones (the pura 80 and the oppo x8, though the latter is only a point better).   Bottom line - this tells the whole story - an Android needs a MUCH better spec list, to offer similar performance to an iPhone, and even then it's still an Android.... the Xiaomi 17 Pro Max seems like a totally great Android phone, if you don't mind the chinese connection, but to call it better than iPhone 17 Pro Max?

For example the slide may say “The fastest phone in the world” in large text taking up most of the space next to an image.

I think the United States intentionally wants to be in the stone age and when we get out of our bubble and see what other countries are doing you realize in some cases that people may think the United States is so ahead of the world in things and what we're brainwashed to think that everyone else is behind. I was wanting a iPhone that just had a hole punch for the camera and yet Xiaomi has shown that it could be done. I actually prefer the finger better than the face ID.

@sebastianvazquez9015,"I see a ton of positive comments about this device, but even MKBHD fails to mention the most crucial point: It’s still NOT an iPhone. None of the features exclusive to IOS that their users want are on this device. So why would this phone sell well in the US? What’s the threat here? It’s basically just another android phone.   If anything, this is a device that other android manufacturers in the US should be afraid of. It’s more likely to snag a substantial amount of Android market share than iPhone users. Isn’t it obvious?   iMessage? FaceTime? Airdrop? iCloud? Eco-system devices like Apple Watch, AirPods, etc. iPhone users simply don’t care about specs and that’s a fact. This device is no threat to Apple. It’s definitely more of a threat to other Android makers for sure, but you can’t replicate the iPhone experience. You can argue all you want and you can match their specs, but ultimately that’s not why people purchase the iPhone. What they want, others don’t have. Plain and simple.",1개월 전,1,

@steventai2482,"It’s great to see comparison videos like this, but as someone who switched from 20 years of Samsung to Xiaomi earlier this year, I can say with experience the long-term experience isn’t quite as good as it’s made out to be.  I bought the Xiaomi Mix Flip in January in Hong Kong after feeling a bit disillusioned by Samsung’s lack of innovation lately. The sales staff told me it came with a global warranty (including the UK), which helped seal the deal. They also mentioned that the inner display had a screen protector, while the outer display was tough enough not to need one.  Four months later, the outer screen cracked after a short drop — indoors, while I was sitting down, and with a case on.  When I contacted the UK team, they initially denied having any warranty at all. Only after I sent a screenshot from Xiaomi’s official site did they acknowledge it — though of course, since the damage was accidental, it wasn’t covered.  Now that I’m back in Hong Kong, I went to their office in person just to share my experience. The staff were fairly dismissive — they told me to buy a protector elsewhere (since there’s no official one) and said, essentially, that “these things happen.” They did offer to fix it, for a charge, but it feels misleading that they don’t sell outer screen protectors while their sales staff emphasize the screen’s toughness and offer no meaningful warranty on it.  Another major reason I chose this phone was the Leica camera, since photography is part of my work. Unfortunately, the camera frequently overheats and shuts down after about 15 minutes of use. The customer service rep told me this was “normal.”  It’s disappointing to see a brand that positions itself as innovative yet lacks the support and reliability expected from a premium experience. I just wanted to share this perspective, since these longer-term realities often don’t come through in quick online reviews.",1개월 전(수정됨),0,

I tried to talk them out of it. I earn well and i told them i can afford an iphone and i use it for my work too. I never realised this is such a big deal.

There are plenty of demos online showcasing this in action.  Also, Xiaomi has a vast ecosystem of IoT devices, including smart appliances like kitchen electronics, TVs, security cameras, smart lights, ACs/purifiers, power switches, smart locks, weighing scales, bicycles/scooters, pet feeders, and even Xiaomi EV cars. All of these devices can be connected and controlled through your smartphone or smart hub.

And as for the supposedly “large battery capacity of Chinese batteries of more than 6000, 7000 mAh”, these are nothing more than fake numbers, since this is Si-C technology and they lose autonomy for some reason even to classic Li-ion 4685 mAh, such as in the older iPhone 16 Pro Max!  If someone thinks, “how is this possible” and you think that Apple is specifically such “losers” and is not able to make a battery of the same size? No, they are laughing at them, specifically showing by optimization that at lower rates they have better performance!  And as for super-fast 100 W charging, this is dangerous due to the issue of heat dissipation. And considering such a large battery capacity, which is only “on paper”, there is a margin for degradation.  This super-fast charging is also not implemented by the same Google and, it would seem, no less lovers of hype and big numbers — Samsung, which has a maximum of only 45 W! 🙂 And as for the camera, everything is already clear. The skin tones in the photo are more correct, the clarity and dynamic range are better on all cameras and, most importantly, the smoothness of the video is still better on the iPhone 17 Pro Max.",1개월 전,0,

I was using Xiaomi phones when I was studying in China in 2013 - that's 12 years ago - just around the time when Xiaomi first got famous in China. They are a huge tech company by now. For a lot of people iPhone has always been the standard for the best but from here on out it doesn't matter anymore what phone brand you buy, Apple, Xiaomi, Samsung - you're covered. Also phones are now so good the average user is maxxed out. I have an iPhone 17 Pro Max but I mostly use my 16 Plus. If I needed to switch to Xiaomi tomorrow it wouldn't be a problem. Yes, surveillance is still an issue. So I will stick with Apple for now but it's no secret Xiaomi gives better value. Just look at the price.",1개월 전,0,

Been using an iPhone for 3+ years and no slowness yet. This is what is good about iPhones which many people care about. When it comes to lesser price or attention seeking features or better battery then Xiaomi does do a better work.

However, I can recognize the good use of this rear screen and I think there's not much discussion about how useful/advantageous it will be for doing IRL (in real life) live streams on social media platforms in general (TikTok, Instagram, etc.). This is because it combines the quality of a rear camera recording with the ability of the person streaming to see themselves and react to the chat simultaneously. And no other smartphone can offer this combination.  Therefore, those who are calling this rear screen useless, in my opinion, are simply failing to visualize broader situations where it is truly very useful. Because it's undeniable that this type of live stream has become increasingly popular among social media users, And this phone is set to be the best by far for this type of content production.",1개월 전,0,

So yeah, Xiaomi lasts pretty long, even on their budget phones bro Before talking about anything you do not know, please make sure you know it XD cause yeah Xiaomi is actually reliable and very good quality. Again, I'm not sponsored or sold by Xiaomi lmao, I just know what I want and that paying over 2000 bucks for a 1tb luxury phone while I can happily pay almost half of the price with the Xiaomi 15 Ultra and have way better cameras and perfs, yeah sorry but I'll prefer to take the Xiaomi one.  Y'all Iphone users are damn obsessed with iphones that you don't even see the truth lol, the truth is that many brands are being way better than the mainstream one (including iphone and Samsung) for cheaper, with equal support or even better sometimes so yeah ..  And finally, I'd add that even tho I've been and still am a Xiaomi user/fan, I might go for another brand later depending on how the market is evolving, I'm searching for the best phone while not wasting money, it was one plus then Xiaomi 14 ultra  and now 15 Ultra (I still prefer it from the 17 pro max  not a bug fan of the idea but that's because I'm not the target, never been a fan of apple interface (that's another opinion tho))",1개월 전,0,

I currently own a Xiaomi 15 and the most annoying thing is the tooltip that appears in the bottom of the screen that stays there for at least 10-15 seconds. And there is no way to get rid of it, you just have to wait. To test it, start a few applications, then click on the button to display all running application and then click on the X button to close them all. This is one way. Have they fixed this ? Because it is a very good reason to look for something else, at least for me. And the battery on my phone after 6 months, is like non existent. I hope Xiaomi will fix these issue in the new versions.

And of course hijacking a bit of the internet search term. Type in 17 pro max and you accidentally stumble upon xiaomi phone with the same name.... something like that. They're aiming for these ""accidents"".  Doesnt matter if theyre branded as a clone. The important thing is people know they exist. Then some will be curious enough to learn about them. Notice they're better then by word of mouth (or reviews) spread it even further.  Once they have the brand recognition they will start to differentiate from Apple again.

But I particularly believe that this display on the back is not a tool that will bring changes to the market. Apart from the selfie part, which for me is the best use of this display, it kind of loses its meaning for everything else because we are already very used to using the front part. When we take it out of our pocket, when we put it on the table, etc., etc. Of course, it's a super novelty, but in everyone's daily life, it won't make much difference. Not to take selfies with the rear camera, but because of the technological carriage, the front cameras will soon have the same quality as a rear one, which, in my opinion, will make this innovation not so useful.",1개월 전,0,

@NickFje,Xiaomi could have been the best but they have so many software issues it is ridiculous. I had the Xiaomi 15 Ultra for almost 4 months and even the most basic features had issues.  Playback in the background would automatically pause all of the time. I tested this with multiple devices and the issue persisted.  Apps can have wrong scaling and will display things like the on screen keyboard outside the borders of the display so it was impossible to log in to some apps.  There is a bug in the os that thinks you have typed in the wrong password to the wifi network you use even though you are logged in and it works. I tested this on 3 different networks and the issue is always present.  This means the phone sends notifications several times every hour for as long as it is logged in to wifi.  Some apps would crash everytime the phone tried to autofill my information so I had to manually fill in all my info when logging in.  I had the official Photography kit that Xiaomi sells and the phone would refuse to charge via the usb c port on the kit so both had to be charged separately.  I tested this with 3 different charging stations I have which support almost every protocol and with the official and third party cables and only one third part cable managed to charge it if I changed the charging station to low current mode.  It was the Anker 250W gan station that managed to charge both at the same time.  I changed to the iPhone 17 Pro and I do not experience any of these issues anymore.  The good thing about Xiaomi is all of these issues are software related and not hardware defects so they can be fixed but I do not have big hopes for that. Many of these features have been considered basic features by other manufacturers for a decade at this point in time.,1개월 전(수정됨),2,

But how am I supposed to see myself in the frame while filming or read text like a teleprompter? Why should a company like SmallRig have to make a separate accessory just so users can see themselves? Everyone, users and accessory makers noticed this issue, but the phone manufacturers either didn’t understand or just didn’t care.

@AndreiIleanu,"Marques, I have ALWAYS held you in the HIGHEST regards when it comes to tech reviews. You are ALWAYS my number one example when talking about tech-tubers. Your laid back attitude, production value, unbiased opinions and overall video quality puts you on top of everyone else in a league of your own. It’s not even fair or not even close, you are THE tech YouTuber, and everyone just follows. Even though I KNOW you didn’t do this on purpose, and you are reviewing this device from a CONSUMER’s perspective, I really think that the lack of context in this video really draws your audience to the WRONG conclusion. Okay, I may or may not be an iPhone user, that doesn’t really matter, it’s not about Apple here, but about Chinese companies. You can’t really review such a chinese product without mentioning that ALL AND ANY copywright laws applied to the civilised world DO NOT apply to China. That is my #1 problem with this video. You are building that product so much, talking about it in the highest regards, yet ackowledge the fact that it’s called 17 Pro Max and move on. Should China be a modern and civilized country, it wouldn’t have been possible for a company in China to straight out copy to such an extent 😳. That is a MAJOR problem for western companies which manufacture any sort of product. ANYONE from China can rip off their design, functionality, etc, produce it at a fraction of the cost (because…CHINA) and sell it for the fraction of the price. That is called THEFT in any language and gives chinese companies HIGHLY unfair advantages! Yes, of course you can take the original and make it better, anyone can do that, objectively. That’s what Apple does every year, right? They improve the device from last year, but they pay for the R&D, for the best engineers in the world, they come up with all the ideas (and it’s not just Apple, but in this case it is copying an iPhone), just for Xiami to come in and say “thank you very much, I’ll have all of this for free” 😌. Reverse engineer it, then add some features on top of it and sell it UNDER THE SAME NAME!!! That’s SUCH smug thing to do! It’s like they’re laughing at us and saying “what are you going to do about it?”. It’s because of this reason I cannot take seriously ANY chinese product - especially tech gadgets not invented by them. You said it yourself: you can’t daily drive it. Of course, because someone stopped them from being even more unfair than they already are! That was such a good thing done by the US when they banned US companies from collaborating with Chinese companeis! So yea, I’ve been sitting here, watching your video like I always do, but every time you said “but better” it feld like someone was stabbing me. I don’t think you meant wrong with this narrative, but I really hope you will change your praise for China in future videos, especially when talking about a product that is BLATANTLY copying another product. That should be a MAJOR factor in establishing if something is worth our money or not - at least in the free, modern and civilised world. This is the FIRST EVER video of yours I have EVER disliked.

@AndreiIleanu," @rmcf1947  I don't agree. China is on a completely different level of copying. You might want to look into that. Stop making it such a ""small thing"" - exactly what Marques did and that's exactly the kind of mentality that SHOULDN'T be spread to masses. I bet you would hate to invest EVERYTHING into a company that would end up copied by a Chinese version product, which then takes over the market and puts you out of business. Because China does NOT compete, it shuts you down. You can't compete with China, bro, as they pay their workers 100 times less per hour - how are you going to do that in a 1st world country? That will put you out of business, which is COMPLETELY unfair and infuriating. If you're CHINA, do it on your own, flex your own shit, stop copying - but they don't care, because nobody's laws apply to them, and we enable them to sell their products in our civilized world.

@LordSaliss,"Just an FYI, the Xiaomi ""Pro Max"" version actrually has all US cell bands for LTE and 5G you need except the mmwave ones (cause China doesnt have mmwave) so you can daily it in the US as long as you have a physical sim card already active that you can put in the phone. Only the Prop Max has the US bands, the regular Pro is missing a couple key ones. The phone only supports Chinese and English language though (for the CHinese version of the phone that is out now), which shouldn't be a problem in the US but if for instance you wanted to have the phone in Spanish then you would be out of luck.",1개월 전(수정됨),0,

Apple always bragged by take reviewers about ecosystem. Apple felt confident by themselves that their ecosystem is unbeatable. Even that doesn’t work about 70% of the time. AirDrop is not up to the mark as it was back in those days not anymore it has become slower than before. I have iPad M2 Pro and iPhone and the transfer speed between them on AirDrop has dropped back when I came with “A bionic” chip it used to transfer files faster. It took less time, but now it takes more time then before not just that the data is not synced anymore before all the calls message were sync in both devices, but now calls are sync, but messages are not sync so I am fed up of this ecosystem, shit, which doesn’t even work anymore",1개월 전,0,

@davidelliott1594,"The interesting thing is despite the available of phones like these and Oppo and others in China, the I Phone 17 line still has very strong demand in China and is doing extremely well there in sales. So for those saying if these phones were available in the US, I phone would be done, it’s not necessarily accurate.   I think despite Xiaomi’s attempts to both emulate and outdo the IPhone in specs, there are certain things that cannot be so easily duplicated. Outside the obvious global brand recognition of Apple for being an early innovator in the smartphone world in general, there are other factors to consider.   One is the video quality. While no longer the absolute photography king, Iphones still reign supreme in video quality and is the favored tool of the majority of mobile creators on a global level, which is what many people, myself included, often purchase it for, is for its innovation in professional video features moreso than iterative spec bumps. One is hard pressed to find a mobile video creator anywhere who doesn’t have at least one IPhone. And while no longer the photo king, I phones are still in the royal family of mobile photograph while being king in videography.   And also the fact for content creators or heavy social media users, I phone photos and video are optimized for many of the biggest social media sites in the world, meaning that while the specs may not seem as impressive on paper, the photos and video actually look better on those sites than higher spec phones.   And second (possibly first) the ecosystem is still unparalleled and massively convenient. I literally take a photo or video with my phone and it automatically goes to my back up phone and my iPad and my Mac without my doing anything extra.   In the end, just because something isn’t a “cheap” knockoff and in someways improves upon the original formula doesn’t mean it is still not recognizable to many people as a knockoff.   Moreso than spec bumps, I like phenomenal all rounders. I like phenomenal video and photography and optimization and security. Moreso than hundreds of features I never use, I like some thing that focuses on the key features that are most important to me as an individual user.   I like seeing android phones continue to innovate, and my first phones were Note-line and S-series Samsungs and I still like them better in terms of multitude of features and customizations etc. But when it comes to “professional use,” resale value, long term endurance, and straight reliability and ecosystem and security and no-nonsense performance, I reach more for my IPhone.",1개월 전(수정됨),12,

A phone with a 3000 mAh battery and good CPU optimization can last longer than one with a larger battery but poorer CPU optimization. Sometimes, comparing only the numbers can be a bit misleading; for example, a 200 MP camera can be overall worse than a 24 MP one.  That said, the Xiaomi 17 Pro Max is amazing.

You either forget—or choose to ignore—something crucial: the back screen is genuinely useful in many everyday situations.  Think about it: most of us place our phones face-down on the table. With a back screen, you can check notifications, adjust settings, or interact with the device without picking it up. Yet you keep repeating that you don’t understand why this feature matters.  The back screen is important precisely because it allows for seamless interaction when the phone is flipped. It’s incredibly handy—especially when you're working, socializing, or simply don’t want to move the phone. You overlook this practical advantage entirely.",1개월 전,0,

The iPhone only started using a similar triple-lens bump layout this year. Also, “Pro” and “Pro Max” aren’t Apple’s inventions — almost every brand uses those names now.

This phone was made for the Chinese market so that it can avert Apple sales and reduce the hold Apple has over the Chinese phone market. All of the Chinese brands are having Apple-like features, software, etc just for this purpose alone. Also Nothing is not far behind them. All Chinese brands are owned and sponsored by the government in some way and they want to keep the foreign influence as low as possible. If this phone hits international waters it will sell close to the iPhone in price, which is not enough to avert global iPhone users.",1개월 전,0,

Also the CN version comes with Google pay and Basic Google Services. I don't really know what the difference is?  I found the CN version of the 17 pro with 512GB for $1,380 Kangaroos online so it's a steal compared to the Australian version which is $2,000 kangaroos.   I use lots of side loaded apps such as Revanced Manager for YouTube, YouTube Music, Spotify, Instagram, Discord, etc. Basically every app on my phone is third party that I use.   I'm unsure if the CN version will work with third party managers since it uses MicroG and GMSCore-Re. Can someone please help before I buy.",1개월 전(수정됨),1,

@zul.kar.nine9,"​ @DWAYNEGRAY  I’ve been an iPhone user since the original iPhone 2G, all the way up to the iPhone 13 Pro Max. But let’s be honest... Apple hasn’t truly innovated in years. Calling Xiaomi crap is downright laughable. I’m not even using a Xiaomi right now, but pretending it’s inferior to an iPhone just shows how deep some people are into Apple’s marketing illusion.  Xiaomi has been pushing boundaries long before Apple even considered stepping out of its comfort zone. People love to say Xiaomi copied the camera plateau ... funny how history proves otherwise. The Mi 11 Ultra featured that distinctive camera design well before Apple lazily slapped a similar plateau onto their phones and called it “new.”  So before you start worshipping a trillion-dollar company for reheating last year’s leftovers, maybe do some research. Blind loyalty doesn’t make you a tech enthusiast... it makes you a walking advertisement.",1개월 전,4,

@JamesMarshall13,"Recently, Antutu noticed that some users are comparing the scores of Antutu iOS version with the scores of Antutu Android version, which we think is unfair comparison.  First of all, since there are obvious differences in the kernel and the development language used by the iOS system and the Android system, the iOS version and the Android version of Antutu Benchmark are two different softwares and the test methods for the two versions are significantly different.  Second, Antutu iOS version and Antutu Android version use different APIs when running the GPU test. The iOS version uses Apple’s Metal API while the Android version uses OpenGL ES and vulkan API. Although the test scenarios used in the two versions are the same, the rendering mechanisms are different, neither does the stress requirement for the hardware.  All in all, the scoring mechanisms for the iOS version and the Android version of Antutu Benchmark are significantly different, and therefore the test results of the two versions are not directly comparable.  To put it simply, the test results of Antutu benchmark only support the comparison within the same system based on the same major version and not support cross-version or cross-platform comparison.  That’s said by Antutu Developers.",1개월 전,0,

One kid watch this one movie that he wanted to watch on one side the other kid on the other side.

Not just Chinese companies, but the American companies that you seem to think are worth standing up for. Regardless of how those companies are progressively f'ing the American masses more and more, regardless of how Chinese companies are making excellent goods and charging reasonable prices, all while pushing the boundaries and moving the market forward, you appear to still think that protecting American trillion dollar corporations is somehow the right mentality to have.

I could maybe start to see it as something more than that if they had taken the opportunity to ditch the front cam altogether, or at most kept it as an under-display one solely for face unlock. Apart from that, the SW will almost certainly be the same old nonsense (to put it politely). They just changed the name — it’s still the “good” old untrustworthy MIUI.  So, the only way I’d even consider it is if, like I said, it had no front cam — though I could live with that — and definitely if 3rd-party SW (custom ROMs) ever became available for it. And since that’s rarely the case for phones that are “thought through” out of the box, I don’t have much hope that it’ll ever be an option for this one...  Btw, thanks Google — that won’t be possible for much longer, thanks to your “pussy moves” in the name of “security.” I mean, you could’ve killed it in one go, but instead you've chosen to do it in a “we didn’t kill it, ppl just lost interest” bunch of ""pussy moves"" Grow a pair!

As someone born and raised in the US, you most likely don’t look into HOW things can be priced that cheap. Min wage in China ranges by region from $2.50-3.90/hour. Then factor in the lack of human rights laws in place. People are forced to work insane hours to the point netting is put around the buildings to prevent people from trying to kill themselves. And we haven’t even touched on R&D and how China just steals everyone’s IP, thus no need to throw that cost into their pricing, since another company did all the leg work.

@jrussellmoore,"All of that is surface-wise though, once one really looks into it things aren't so great as they appear to be. Software differences between the Chinese version of HyperOS (but it happened with MIUI just the same) and the international one are abysmal; and it's been like that for at least a decade already!! I have experienced both and it's night and day, there is plenty of stuff announced on new updates for OS that doesn't make it to the international version; they have different stores, different themes selections, etc.  Stock apps, all filled with ""recommendations"" (read, ads) in the international version of the OS; off the top of my head: the Downloads app, Music, Video (and this one is insane! One can only disable ads temporarily for up to a month, then they get re-enabled!), the browser, the themes app, ...  Never ending selection of sponsored apps pre-installed with the phone, inability to disable some of the apps unless through ADB (I am not even asking to uninstall them, disabling is fine). Really, pretty good hardware (depending on the model), software not up to par. Firmware upgrades are market dependent, if you're lucky to be in a large region and your model is popular, you may get more or less regular updates for a while, otherwise updates may stop flowing maybe even half a year before they're declared EOL (declared, but clearly they were already). My only hope is that things change now with the EU mandating some things to happen and pushing vendors for longer support windows.  Obviously anything remotely related to custom builds is out of the question. To think that Xiaomi had such a large following of tech people and look at what they've become 😔 They even wanted Google to implement something to prevent users from extracting the APKs out of the phone back in 2022, just the installer mind you, nothing hidden or esoteric; luckily it went nowhere.",1개월 전,0,

Most people would say Xiaomi in less than a second but let's not forget that Xiaomi announced its 17 pro just one week after the iPhone, with a fully functional model, it was complete, ready to ship, something that we all know it's impossible to do in the tech field, you can't just design, order the pieces with your suppliers chain and build a copy ready to sell and ship in just a week. So the real question here is: which project came first: apple's or xiaomi's, and that we probably will never know for sure but I'd guess Xiaomi's project came first due its complexity and suppliers chain but they are okay with letting Apple announcing it first because they wanted all the buzz and marketing after it.",1개월 전,0,

The Vivo X200 pro (global) vs the X200 Ultra (China only)  Both use the same 6000mAh, both use 2K screen 120hz. Yet the X200 Pro got 12 hours sot (2 hour more) while the X200 Ultra only got 10 hours of SOT. My reference is technick (can't gives link nowadays). Using china only phones to go against US phones to test its battery life using the US software Enviroment (Google) is like testing Iphone 17 pro max from the us by using chinese apps (although since ios is owned by apple themselves, the difference wouldn't be as big as android phones) bruhhh",1개월 전,1,

We all saw the video where this Xiaomi model beats the iPhone by a couple of minutes — it has 2000 mAh more, for Christ’s sake, and a next-gen battery.  The real accomplishment is what Apple did with the iPhone battery and CPU. Comparing any iPhone to any Android flagship is like comparing a gasoline car to a diesel one — they both have pros and cons and, in many cases, are incomparable, mostly because iOS is more stable and better optimized than Android (and what they use in Xiaomi devices).

The 17 pro has battery life that lasts ages, the screen is great, iMessage, airdrop, AirTags, seamless integration with my laptop, iCloud, I don’t really care to give up these things for even better battery life or faster file transfer speeds, but then again, it’s all personal preference :)  If you don’t own any Apple devices, sure it probably makes sense, but again, I wouldn’t be buying a phone that looks like an iPhone, I’d be buying something Apple doesn’t make, like a folding phone or something cool like that, actually take advantage of the benefits of android instead of just looking like you got a Temu iPhone 😂",1개월 전,0,

@TakuMawoneke,"I've been using Xiaomi phones for a while. Like 4 yrs now. I used Samsung and other brands. Every phone has a weakness. Just make sure the weakness isn't what you prioritize. People say that xiaomi's software is junk but they lie. Back in the days xiaomi devices were super cheap because you would actually pay for that phone through advertisement on the phone itself, in the form of recommendations and news articles. But you had an option to turn it off completely. People didn't like it so Xiaomi ditched it. Now the phones are a little bit pricey. Not to Apple and Samsung extent though. So no more ads on the phone. But because people are people they still say the software is junk and they dont actually use the phone. It's a shame you know. Always make sure you get what you want. Nothing should stop you. Just to let you know, xiaomi really excels in photography and videography. It's like having a mirrorless camera with a screen that functions as a phone. It's usually the fastest phone when comparing against apple, pixel, samsung, vivo, oppo and huawei. It has fast charging and a large capacity battery. You can customize it however you like. It's the only company with the most broad ecosystem in the world. They have cars, scooters, laptops, tv, fridges, watches, cookers etc which you can control with the Xiaomi devices.",1개월 전,2,

Not only to met each country regulation, they also have to optimize their unit/phones to the global software (google). Remember, in china there's no google. Real example of this? Look up vivo x200 pro (global) vs x200 ultra (china only). Both have the same battery capacity, both have the same display, etc etc. Yet, the vivo X200 Pro last 2 hour longer (12 hours which is also few hour longer than the s25 Ultra).

Vivo x200 pro (global) vs x200 ultra (china only) look at technick battery comparison. Both of these phones have the same battery,screen, etc. Yet the global x200 pro can last 2 hours longer.

Until they are forecfully dissolved, or destroyed.  I'm not putting my money into a regime which is currently causing Xinjiang and Tibetan cultural erasure. Nor will I be helping to fund an invasion into an independent sovereign and democratic nation, Taiwan.  There are many other things the CCP do which I don't want to support.  Same with OnePlus phones, which I bought  before I learned of this stuff about the CCP.   But even this phone, I had to disable roughly 110 apps which were preinstalled, and didn't do much, aside from hide from android settings, only through ADB related apps which can list installed system apps, and disable some of them, and others sat almost inactive, except when sending random bits of data I couldn't identify the source of, to Chinese IP addresses associated with data centers, or at least what I could find from their limited and conreolled information out of their authoritarian almost a dictatorship type police state.  I just can't support this brand, I'm sure there are many lovely people who have worked on this, and deserve the support. But unfortunately, the regime they live under will leech on their efforts, and manipulate it in anyway which supports themselves.  This is hard to explain on a YouTube comment that I'm hardly proof reading, but I hope my point is clear  There's many reasons I don't want this phone.

Its reputation with consumers outside is not that good; that is why Samsung is a go-to brand when it comes to Android because of its reputation. And don't forget the majority of people outside of China bought the phone because of trade-in value. Because every 1 to 2 years they trade in their phone and buy a new one, and Xiaomi phones' trade-in value is very low compared to Samsung and iPhone. It's a big sacrifice for consumers to buy a phone that after a year you cannot trade in or sell at a high price. That is why it will not sell well outside of China.",1개월 전,0,
