Fantastic place to shop for IT gear and unbelievable repair resources. From data recovery to finding a faulty chip in my Dell laptop and replacing it on the spot for RMB50 (AUD10). There is another 7 storey building where they do the repairs.  Even if you cannot speak Chinese, they are perfect doctors! They find the problem and fix it.  If you do not know your way around just go to a small PC centre and let them build it for you. The IT district is ok for pros and techno-savvy people who know what they want.

Here’s a quick test: Have you ever lied, stolen, or used God’s name in vain? Jesus said, “Whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” If you have done these things, God sees you as a lying, thieving, blasphemous, adulterer at heart, and the Bible warns that one day God will punish you in a terrible place called Hell. But God is not willing that any should perish. Sinners broke God’s Law and Jesus paid their fine. This means that God can legally dismiss their case: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” Then Jesus rose from the dead, defeating death. Today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will give you eternal life as a free gift. Then read the Bible daily and obey it. God will never fail you.",4년 전,0,

(with exceptions)  going off of that logic, lower end products (i3, i5, 1660) tend to be cheaper retail in China, while higher end tend to meet the US market.

If they're selling at same price like online shopping, business will go bankrupt 100%. 2nd, buying online is a risk, much easier getting scam compared to direct shopping. I would go to shop directly instead of line, besides i don't need to wait for products to arrive and i can immediately on the spot.

@zeyuzhang2017,"Almost every Chinese cities have similar places like Huaqiangbei, commonly called “Diannaocheng”(computer city), where all electronics sellers gather. These places have a bad reputation in locals, they just deceive buyers who don’t know a thing about PCs, and sell them low-end PCs for a relatively  high price, one of my friends bought one lenovo laptop in 2018 for about 1000 US dollars equivalent, end up getting a laptop with core i5 processor, 8G RAM, AMD RX530 and a HDD. That’s a specially customized configuration for stores like these, and these special models suffers from inferior hardwares and lack of BIOS updates. He finally sold that for a low price and purchased a much better much cheaper one from online store, for these stores always try hard thwarting clients return  these machines. Fortunately nowadays their businesses are significantly undermined by online stores.",5년 전,0,

First of all, it DEFINITELY does not have the best medical system ever, you can literally be charged different things depending on which hospital you go to, plus there are an absurd number of regulations that doctors need to follow, meaning that in hospitals about half of the workers aren't medically trained.  Then you said America has the best economy, which is wrong by almost every measure. In actual fact, the economy being ""good"" or ""bad"" depends equally on employment rate (the US is 22nd). It doesn't even have the highest nominal GDP, it's 7-9th depending on your source. If also doesn't have the highest in ANY MEASURE of GDP, according to the world Bank (for those wondering, that title belongs to Luxembourg, followed by Qatar). It also doesn't have the highest GDP PPP (gross domestic product by party purchasing power), which is probably the most important thing, because it adjusts for the price of living. If you're in America, everything is say 1.5x the price, so even if you have the most money, you can buy less. All of my sources from this have come from the World Bank",5년 전,2,

@evilpajamas8192,"@Angel Murchison i lived in Shanghai for 18 years and 9 years in US, and its really apparant, I can give you a few examples. Back in Shanghai at 2008, we have pirated DVD everywhere even in shops at popular areas, really high quality and cost only a few quarters, even come with bluerays. they are illegal and by law punishable by jail time. Although time to time cracked down but most of the time they just get a warning with at most a small fine and they restart their business in a while, meanwhile in US this is a felony and the taint follows you for the rest of your life. Traffic is another example, China have similar road rules to US, but back then it is sooo much easier than US to get away with speeding, cutting, or other variety of road violation; even if you are caught, most of the time police just give you a warning and let you go. In US road rules are super strict and if you speed in residential area you are done for. Once I had a roadtrip with a singaporean friend whom i studied with in shanghai he got fined for speeding ~20 over limit and got pulled over by cops with a fine, which is incredulous back then for us who are used to Shanghai traffic rules. Smaller ones like firecracker, or burning paper money to your ancestor on the road is illegal too, but people do it anyways despite the rules. However i hear that Shanghai had really started to enforce their intellectual property rules, road rules, and cracked down on firecrackers over the last decade but from what i hear in second/third rate cities things are still the same. Law enforcement in China is really about consensus, and as long you dont politicize and advocate your wrongdoings theres alot of loops you can jump and law enforcers look another way.",5년 전,2,
@angelmurchison1731,"Evil Pajamas yeah I still disagree. Since we’re drawing out our stereotypes, if you’re Chinese I imagine you were in a pretty affluent neighborhood. That may explain why you never interacted with a bootlegger, or walked into a flea market filled with obviously counterfeit merchandise, or heard fireworks in a residential area, or fucking gunshots for that matter.  I speed to and from work every day, but traffic cops are different in every county to be fair.   How many times do you hear gunshots in an average year in Shanghai? Or even see a gun held by a non-official? I’ll bet zero. You’ll have to do a lot better if you want to say that the Chinese don’t care so much about rules.",5년 전,2,
@evilpajamas8192,"@Angel Murchison I am a Canadian Taiwanese. I think its kinda a misunderstanding, what started my conversation is that a lot of people are surprised in this comment section that chinese are able to access youtube, and thought living in China is equivalent of living in a oppressive regime like North Korea where you can get severely punished for violating this type of petty laws. What I was trying to say is that China have ALOT of those petty laws but you usually aren’t severely punished for violating those. In the US ofcourse people violate laws too, but I think the high incarceration rate there reflected on how serious each country take their laws.",5년 전,2,

@swiftoooo,"Guys, Not all Westerners are bigots. The people commenting hate against the Chinese people are the rarest of beasts out here in America; we call them ""assholes."" I personally don't have anything against China; I've been there twice, and I find a lot about the country highly questionable. Conversely, the country itself is also quite nice when you get away from the cities. If you find a racist asshat in the comments, please, do us a favor and go out of your way to make their day miserable. There's those who think they are ""educated,"" those fat men who sit behind a $200 chromebook munching cheetos for lunch.  I worked my ass off for 14 years out in Montana before I moved out to a decent university in New England; my alma mater is Boston College. My father is kind of like the guys in the comments. Put bluntly, he's stupid. There's one key difference here: he's a hard working American farmer, supporting the homeland and lands around the world, and he's got the balls to admit that he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer. He's served in a war, travelled all 50 states, and he's taught me very well, so it seems. Those who dare to call themselves ""Americans,"" rethink who you are. A sexually frustrated 15-year-old gamer trying to take out his anger on an entire ethnic group with a 5000-year history. I've been there. An unemployed college graduate, eating 30-cent noodles, brooding over their unemployed status, trashtalking a minority to fullfill their useless selves. I've been there. We can't be like this, we've got work to do. We complain that ""auh no china steal r tech"" when in reality we're too lazy to get off our asses and work, and too arrogant to learn from others we consider ""inferior"" because of our superpower status. Finally, I ask that you think about this logically. If you comment that the ""chinese people hate others ruthlessly,"" yet spread hate yourself, then in what way are you in a position to comment on the Chinese people's hate? The fact that all Chinese people are racist is a bizzare generalization that can seldom be applied, let alone represent an ethnic group accurately. If you call America the land of freedom where everyone is treated equally, yet you deem China a land of prejudice, how is America then a land of equality? You yourself just proved that we only apply equality ostensibly. Try it yourself.   Now, I realize that there's no way to really effectively curb or dissuade a professed asshole, but what you can do as an individual is to refrain from having a reaction provoked out of you. An asshat's goal is to provoke reactions, and if you deny them that, then they'll hopefully retreat into their abysmal mental state to rot away.",6년 전,0,

@bobjones7908,"For a first trip to China, Linus did right by getting someone who helped. Would have been better to bring a bilingual native with him and have them help, not another foreigner - unless that foreigner can say (for example) laptop in Chinese. My recommendation [that worked very well with me] is to learn Chinese (including how to say SSD or memory stick, etc. in Chinese), and then develop a good relationship with one (back-of-the-mall) vendor. Foreigners earn more money than locals in China, and helping the local economy is actually a good thing. I would negotiate a 50rmb price down to 20rmb but still pay the vendor 50rmb anyway - and tell her or him to pocket the extra. I would also bring other mono-lingual Americans to the same vendor for their computing needs, and that went a long way to develop a trust relationship. After a year, my vendor would go out of their way for me to do right: Telling me things like, that is fake or that is too expensive or that is a good price. If my vendor didn't have it, they would find it from others that did, and not disappear for a half hour, but actually bring me along. That relationship with one vendor was key, and that is what Linus or his friend didn't have.",6년 전,36,

On the other hand on western online markets you usually only get expensive gadgetary and never ever rare cheap components. When I tried to buy 2,5mm ribbon crimped cables in the west it was like ""50 cent per cable, minimum 100 cables"" - i ordered 400 cables for €7 from a well known chinese site. Same for USB cables to connect a mainboard to a backbracket - none at all in the west, 20 pieces did cost €10 in china, same for slightly special drive bays, replacement fans for my 1070... seriously, i only invest like 2min to search in the west because in the east I can get everything faster, with more choice and a lot cheaper.",6년 전,0,

And i would have to say 80% of the product there are fake, because large manufacturer have or had factories in China and most of these factory will just do small ""underground"" business with other factories for extra benefits(money) to give out tech or non too essential secret about a product and let the other smaller factory to make a duplicate of the product to sell. Since they cannot sell it on a big market cause their product will get found out, so they go straight to places like this to sell.

You are right about that the bracelet beeing against static buildup, but none in their right mind with any actualy knowledge lets their PC sit even 1 minute before cleaning. Letting it sit for an hour would make absolutely no difference to the capacitors charge, since there is nothing consuming load. let me explain it to you :  This also has nothing to do with static buildup, but it is about the capacitors who were actively charged by your PSU. To simply fully uncharge the capacitors, simply press the power-button of your PC. It might flare up for a moment, after this all the capacitors in your pc are fully uncharged.",6년 전,0,

@megatrix500,"JEEZ worst comment section EVER. Have any of you ever been to a Chinese tech mall for a whole day? Me neither, that's why I have no idea how stressful it can be, SPECIALLY without speaking Chinese. Y'all are probably just a couple lifeless fucks who think themselves omnipotent and omniscient because strange parts and the internet in general make everything look easier and more familiar. Like, you don't have a PhD in applied quantum physics for watching MinutePhysics or SixtySymbols or anything else. So just because you watch Strange Parts videos doesn't mean you are a purebred chinese negotiator. And for those who are, or for those who really could survive in a Chinese tech mall keeping their sanity somewhat intact, not everyone has to be like you, and probably there is nobody exactly like you, and you're not the protagonist of the world.   I mean, there are some people who are from china or at least know what they're doing who will tell you to avoid going to the mall. Why? Does it have a force field which surfaces your true self, specially if you're a dick? No, it's just a stressful place where you get ripped off, SPECIALLY if you have no idea how to speak Chinese. Y'all should probably unsub and go follow happier, safer, less harsh content, maybe go to the king of random, where EVERYTHING is scripted so the few moments of genuine personality you get are all fun and laughs. You won't even have to worry about swear words. Maybe, idk, go watch some Game Theory (but not GT Live, that stuff is people basically being themselves, so steer clear). Or TechQuickie, without going any further, if you can handle such rough content of course.   Good day random reader. Enjoy your happy, easy, emotionless life.",6년 전,0,

I end up selling everything I bought for half the price and starting to do research on my own. I guess that's how I learn about almost everything. Get ripped off then learn. So the best way is to buy online from reliable site.  About the store buying stuff from other places that showed in the video. It's kind of common in these stores, especially computer mall. They have a big warehouse and they store things in it.  By storing I mean there's a upper seller who provides lots of merchandise. And the store you buy from take the merchandise from upper seller.

I really don't need that hassle and I have not been there in years. Instead I am buying everything on Taobao now. You can literary find EVERYTHING there at cut throat prices. Amazingly even imported electronic parts are often cheaper to buy on Taobao then in a store in Hong Kong. The only reason still to go to Huaqiangbei is to buy fake stuff - which I don't need. As even old people figure out to get their shopping done online - a lot of traditional retail business is closing down in China including these electronic markets.

I went up floor by floor, then got bored by floor 5. I then realized there was not a way down until you get to the next floor, then found out the escelator was out of order on that floor. By the time I got out of there, I was exhausted, and overwhelmed and completely dissatisfied with shopping. I've never been more grateful to be an American consumer than when I was there; knowing I could go back to the ship (US NAVY)  and order all the parts I wanted at reasonable prices online, lol. The mall that we had visited was soon nicknamed the 8 stories of consumer electronics hell. We we're lucky to have gotten out. Rumor has it some poor souls are still there wandering.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

So imagine loving to travel, do you really wanna spend weeks of your life trying to learn the basics of the language for being in a country for 1-2 weeks?

There’s a difference between saying that two buildings (or sections) looking similar and saying that an entire race of people looking similar.

@ColourlessAmiba," @bobzter434  I have to admit that I made a mistake in my earlier message, I said that going out of your way to conflate two buildings looking similar to an entire race looking similar proves that you are somewhat racist. I am wrong about that, conflating an entire race into a general depiction is stereotypical, not racist, but my point of you trying to play race into the equation when there is no race to be involved makes you a race baiter, not an actual racist. Sorry for calling you a racist, close, but not actually one.  I'm not a troll, I'm someone who is trying to tell you that the definition of racism is not conflating two buildings looking similar to the entire Asian race looking similar.   The definition of racism once again is any unreasonable hatred towards a single race for meaningless differences in genetics, intelligence, or physical capability, or any sense of racial superiority upon those grounds.   The definition of stereotyping is claiming that an entire race looks similar due to your inexperience in detecting differences in facial features, most of the time solely due to your lack of integration with that race. Or claiming that all Asians have small dicks. An over generalization of an entire group or race due to either a poorly understood fact, or misinformation. For example, the stereotype for Canadians which I am one claims that we live in igloos, ride moose to school, and are always polite. One of these stereotypes in this video was clearly broken by Linus, not completely, but he was very distasteful at some points (i.e: Expecting a country that is primarily Mandarin to be able to speak English).  Definition of race baiting is to utilize race, or to conflate race into a subject that has nothing to do with race solely to generate an argument about race. Using race as the bait to drive a conversation that's separated from that into a conversation engulfed by that.   Get your definitions straight before calling me a troll, because I have done nothing, that I can see, where I try to elicit an unwarranted reaction by giving an out there statement.  Being a racism apologist and someone who argues that the definition of racism has been so construed that the actual term is useless now is completely different, so please get that straight too.",6년 전,1,
@bobzter434," @ColourlessAmiba  You admit he was stereotyping people; you admit he was very distasteful to the people he was stereotyping. These combined traits make for the definition of racism. You got all the pieces right, all that's missing is to put 'em together so to avoid not one but many mistakes. As long as you do and pin them onto others you'll be exposing a troll.",6년 전,0,

And sure enough there was a mandarin-speaker and no english, so we did the transaction in mandarin.  But yeah, it's apples and oranges -- english is the international language... you think non-native-english speaking europeans in china ask 'does anyone speak german/french/italian'?  No, they ask the same, if anyone speaks english.  Difference i've found is, those europeans often actually get angry and frustrated with the low-level of english here.  I'm guessing because in europe most young people at least have pretty stellar english, and there's freer travel between countries so it's used much more often.  Linus had the subtitle/caption ""western entitlement"" at that part, but frankly i've found africans and arabs in china to behave way more entitled than the 'westerners' i've known.

Then after a couple years in country i'd say i've become 'moderately fluent'. Guess it depends what your standards are for (bare) fluency.  Sure, it's much harder than say spanish or german, but it's really just not as difficult as people usually think.    Also the things that people usually point to as the main difficulties (tones and writing system) aren't the major hurdles, it's the complete lack of cognates with english.  Over half the words in spanish or german, and even a pretty good share of vocab in slavic languages has a correlate with some english word.

@haifantian6043,"I lived in that city for 14 years before coming to the states. Had been to this mega-supermarket for electronics more than 100 times. Some tips: 1. It's impossible to buy stuff with a cheaper price in China due to the high taxes (only getting higher with the tariffs) UNLESS: You buy a-billion-hand used hardware from a Bitcoin mine or some server rigs. Some lowest end products with weird naming that are supposedly for internet cafes or pre-built machines. Stuff that is already broken but can't be told from light inspections. DSLRs with fake shutter counts.........saw a shelf of D4s with wears from the Syrian War and shutter counts of 10,000s..... 2. Don't use the ""foreigner"" badge........ Price goes up anywhere from 1.5x to 10x the moment you say ""I am an American"". Try to find your Chinese friend that ACTUALLY KNOWS THE PLACE to go with you and let him do all the talking. DO NOT trust your friends' friends. I had a friend that got scammed by his own BROTHER IN LAW FFS. 3. If you think you are scammed horribly, contact the police......The police treat foreigners much better than they do for locals.......... 4. This market can be a good place for weird customized stuff and some second-hand goods. You don't really want to buy new products for anything major here. The customer service is non-existent as many shops move from place to place due to the rent. 5. Don't ever buy any accessories such as SD cards, cables or anything cheap. They are 99% fake and you can never tell the difference with some high-end fakes. I saw a fake Magic Mouse once with half the price and the EXACT look and feel. The only difference is the weight. 6. This place is going through a downfall. There were way too many scams. Now people simply buy stuff online, where the price is sometimes even lower. The major incomes currently are OEM factories that use the place as a source market, a small number of geeks like me, old people and women who know nothing about the place.",7년 전,494,

You can see example of these in the video and even in the end you can see it with GPU that they purchase.  2)These stores are not organized. As seen in the video they sell random stuff.  3)Language Barrier. Linus clearly doesn't know mandarin, and most of the products shown here are in Chinese. This mean that Linus doesn't know if the product his buying is trustworthy or not. Also the added pressure that he doesn't understand any of the conversation or haggling that going on off-screen.  4)These sellers are persistent. Just imagine the female clerk in a brand store that keeps following you when you are shopping. These people are 10x more persistent. I'm sure there's a lot of off-screen nagging that can piss even Mother Theressa.   5)It's a cramped place, Loud, and like a maze. It's 3x Stress.  6)He's never been to this kind of store before. First time is always nerve wrecking.  7)He doesn't have a lot of cash.  8)This video is totally unplanned. And it's not just Linus fault, but Scotty's fault too.",7년 전,0,

He screamed and moaned, etc. etc., but after I pointed out that I was already wet and could not get much wetter, he could take or leave my price as there were many other vendors and someone would take it.  He did and I got my umbrella....now for the rest of the story my wife is from Hong Kong and speaks fluent Cantonese and Mandarin she was standing a few feet away trying to pretend she did not know me, as I walked away with my umbrella she heard the wife scream at her husband ""how dare you let a tourist (actually it was a racial slur) get the better of you!"".

@sparrow40k,"After spending close to 25 minutes watching this video, I do have to ask... What was the point of all this? Randomly deciding to purchase and build a PC within trading hours expecting it to be cheaper with no plan other than to aimlessly walk around looking at parts and getting very vocal about how stressed and annoyed you are that you've said yourself this task. I mean at one point you straight up said that there was a better deal at the other store but you just didn't care... This do not believe this is an accurate representation of either unique brands or lower pricing as you just didn't try. I mean, if Mr Parts didn't looked confused enough about the whole situation, he has even put as a comment on this video that the computer is essentially useless to him so he is just going to use it for a giveaway. I am sure he is extremely grateful but nothing of this video had any logic or reason to it. When you asked him what does he edit on and you misunderstood you for what application he used, you didn't bother to correct him by what you were asking because you didn't actually care about the answer as you already has your mind set on the idea regardless of what he already had.  This entire video feels like nothing more than a last minute university assignment. The night before it was due you decide to work on it 110% but because time is so limited, any and all inconveniences annoy and/or stress you. The closer the deadline came, the more stressed you got but by some miracle you got it done but naturally you got a shit mark. You didn't even act surprised because you know inside that you didn't even try.  Of cause at the end of the day it is your channel and your company but it isn't often I'd watch a 25 minute long video from a reputable name of more than 6.8 million viewers and question ""why does this exist? What was the intent or purpose of this video?"". I don't even know why you were stressing when no one asked you to build this PC.  Lastly, I get it's probably not fun to look back at your ""assignment"" and see it get negative reviews by myself and many others in the comments so to leave on a positive note and make things less critical, I will say' very cool screw driver.",7년 전,259,

If he does not speak your language, being a dick won't solve that issue. It would make it worse probably because anybody can tell if you're being a dick no matter the language. Now THAT's universal.   I understand your point though, but you speak like of what I expect from the stereotype of people living in the US/Other similar cultures that speaks natively english.

And when that expectation is not met, you act like 'wth? you were supposed to be able to understand me because I am from the states. Murica #1'. Whatever dude.

@chrisfan836,"Generally, you picked a wrong place to buy the stuff you need.  Dude, you went to a Chinese PC mall to get individual parts? Even we natives dont do that now.   But it's understandable that you want the experience there.  To get the right parts in China is a lot different than your shopping experience back home where retailers are actually RETAILERS.  Most of the shops don't depend on random customers for their profits, a lot of their business is B2B in nature. If you go in a store and say "" hey, I want this"", natives or not, they WILL TRY to get smart on emptying your pocket.   If you want to go there and get what you want with a decent price, you need to have friends on the inside, we are not proud of it, but that's how it works.  Keep in mind that PC BUILDING is not a popular concept in CHINA, because most of our PCs are built by our vendors, even custom ones. Most of the stores you go in, they know most likely less than you.  Buy the components you need online, that's where most of us do nowdays, because our experience at the mall is no easier than yours.",7년 전,24,

Linus builds on ""western model"" where sturdy, flashy, higher priced stuff is touted as best. While Scotty is amazed by hacker culture where you have to assemble stuff from little parts and actually build say a low end motherboard cutting cost is the best part because no-one got the bucks especially working free hacker culture. True you have to buy a sturdy computer (PC) and shouldn't mess with most functional parts. So both are in their mode, but Linus is acting like he's living in a colonial era.

One guy straight up tells the OP to not ""go out in public and ruin everyone else’s day"", which I don't even know how you would do by crying.

If a person with depression got these replies, they'd be in serious danger of committing suicide.  I wanna fucking vomit, that's how appalled I am.

@lostreclue4788, @Denisowator  no buddyl you're the one calling people names and everything else... You are the only one in the wrong here you and you yourself alone. going to get help isn't a bad thing and I did not say it as a bad thing I myself have anxiety also but I took the initiative to go and try  to help myself along.. But obviously you missed that part where I told him I had anxiety also... and life improved dramatically so no it is only you wanting to be offended by everything.... And play Captain Save the World. Talking nonsense that you don't know what you're talkin about medications do help.. I don't mean narcotics but certain antidepressants can go a long ways so no like I said the only one in the wrong here is you..,7년 전(수정됨),0,
@Denisowator,"I honestly think you may have some more issues other than anxiety. Some mental issues if you know what I mean (and I mean that in a non-disrespectful way).  First off, anyone looking at these replies will easily see there's 2 people (myself not included) that are in the wrong. Secondly, I don't call people names at any point. The ""Bitch!"" is in the style of ""bitch please!"".  Thirdly, medication cannot FIX anxiety, as I clearly said before. I never said anything about it not being able to help somewhat. Also wtf is ""play Captain Save the World"" supposed to even mean? I'm just stating my opinion on youtube comment replies.  I really suggest you re-read my reply, because you definitely are the one who doesn't know what they're talking about. I was genuinely confused about why you just said most of the stuff you said. I understand your anger when I said medication can't fix anxiety as you have anxiety, but what's with saying stuff like ""it is only you wanting to be offended by everything.... And play Captain Save the World.""? Uncalled for. Are you telling me you have no issues with someone insulting people with anxiety, and encouraging them to not go out in public (possibly worsening their anxiety)?",7년 전(수정됨),1,
@lostreclue4788," @Denisowator  no I don't have any mental issue. I'm not the one jumping down random people on the internet through because I see post that are ( in your defense) rude, I understand that there are assholes in the world and it is the internet and it's never going to stop people are going to be dicks in life especially on the internet because they don't have to deal with real-world repercussions. And no medication doesn't fix anxiety but can help to manage it so you can live a day-to-day life and so can Lifestyle Changes . I no longer take medication but for a long time it did help me while I was changing different aspects of my life to where I could manage it on my own it is a chemical imbalance in the brain and if you can learn to deal with things in a different manner life can change dramatically and that can be said for anybody. Playing Captain Save the world I mean that it's the internet man you've got to realize that it's the internet and no matter what you do people are going to be rude and defensive on the internet mostly the kids which are probably kids in high school or even Middle School talkin stupid crap calling people pussies and everything else and you commenting isn't going to change it granted it may be beneficial to you and maybe you feel morally obligated but you and I both know the truth that it's not going to change. we can correct them but until they realize that they are wrong and something happens in their life they are not going to change..  What I mean is it's kind of childish to say I hope people report them just as I have.. I mean reporting what they did isn't going to do anything besides the guy that called him a pussy because that is wrong but the other comments know it's not going to do anything even on the liberal platform of YouTube. so whether I agree with them or not which I don't is irrelevant to the situation.. you just got to stop being offended for everyone bro I mean it's the internet and the modern day equivalent to the Wild West vocally people are going to do whatever the hell they want.. however I applaud you for standing up for the guy but the real question is would you do in real life face-to-face with these people",7년 전(수정됨),0,

I myself HATE being rushed, like when I really want to finish something, but people are constantly telling me to hurry up and that we're late for something (which I also really want to go to), etc.  Little story time: I very well remember a younger self trying to get ready as my family was going somewhere, them telling me to hurry up and put my shoes on and that we're late (when we weren't really). I really wanted to finish doing stuff that caused me to make more time (like brushing my teeth, finding my phone, cleaning my glasses, etc.), but at the same time I wanted to arrive on time. The stress they were putting on me was constantly building up with every word. I remember getting very shaky and panicked sometimes, and I legit cried.

China recently has gotten more expensive than the states when it comes to PCs. a macbook pro is actually more expensive than buying it in the states. same with iphones. You're really only going to see cheaper parts when it's from a wholly Chinese manufacturer. And since most Video cards and processors (at least good ones) are from foreign companies then you'll not be getting cheap components, and the cheap components you could be getting you won't want (Linus's tubing as an example). China isn't the land of amazingly cheap and shitty components it once was. And the shopping experience sucks here too. They'll almost never leave you alone while you are browsing in a store.

@20cnVision,You know you're supposed to haggle the price down in those kind of stores ? They usually start at something like 500-1000% of the actual price. When we were in China one seller wanted about 200€ for one of those laser pointers and we got it for 10€ in the end.  Of course it's more stressful but you're just not supposed to pay all the initial prices.,7년 전,0,

@BenjaminVestergaard,"Your enemy in this video is your time pressure. I got a very decent flight simulator joystick set in Guangzhou at a third of the price anything similar would cost here in Denmark. It took a while, and we had to wait for someone to drive it in to the mall on a moped, from the suburbs which is where things are made or stored. When you start saying ""whatever, I'll just buy this"" is where you do wrong... I don't mind paying sticker-price in China, but then it better be EXACTLY what I ask the shop-keeper for, otherwise I'll walk away.  Edit: even after they had it brought in, I could have just walked away, I had not promised to buy at that time. That's just the service you get in China, they also unbox stuff for you to see it before you buy it. Exactly because there's been problems with fraud. Also don't just hand over cash, 'at least', look like you're inspecting your own 100 rmb bills before handing them over, otherwise you risk that a not so honest shop will run them through the machine, switch some of the bills around and give you counterfeits while telling you that they are not genuine... in this case you were lucky to find, to the bottom, honest shop keepers.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

And if customs stops me then it would have sucked. But those generic electronic stuffs and smartphones sure cost much less (don't buy an android from China unless you know how to install google apps into it).

I think Linus was a bit nervous during the trip as you have language barrier with the Chinese, less familiar with eastern culture that's a lot different in terms of language contextual environment, and the chattering backpack guy was giving pressure to the speechless Linus. If you're planning to be back to this kind of electronic fair again, you'd better seek for some tutorials or make a full preperation of what you're about to purchase, where is that stall located, or any language troubleshooter. There're officially authorized products like Panasonic cameras or some gpu cards but there're also fake products, pirates, electronic garbage or anything else like what you've seen at the 1st floor. In summary familiarizing the unfamiliar environment in a diverse culture is vital for anyone planning to that kinda place. Greeting from a sophomore in Canton!",7년 전(수정됨),0,

Second if any of you remember the original Despicable Me, you Know there is a scene when Vector kidnaps the three girls and shoots a series of heat-seeking misses at Gru, he then dodge them all. According to the speed of an average ballistic missile (1900 mph) and the size of the missile according to his ankle size, Gru can perceive and move at such a speed that the missiles only move 9.5 miles per hour, 0.5% of their original speed. Plus after this Gru punches a shark and it is paralyzed meaning its spine is probably shattered, to remind you it would require a force greater than 3,000 newtons to fracture the spine. That’s equal to the impact created by a 500-pound car crashing into a wall at 30 miles per hour. I rest my case.""",7년 전,0,

By the way, people in China generally shop online. The online price is usually lower and there are more discount opportunities. Companies such as Taobao, JD and Amazon can provide free shipping within three days in most cities in China. You pay higher prices for your laziness, lack of knowledge, and poor preparation. There is nothing to complain about. Provide better video for your audience instead of pushing your own problems into this market or even the country.   Your video is suspected of inducing people to misunderstand China. At the same time, you did not submit an application to use VPN in China. This allegedly violated Chinese laws.

So we never warry about where we are, although most Chinese were living in places thousands and hundreds miles away from Guangdong province, they can buy what they want as easily as cantonese.",7년 전,6,
@dfreeuns,"Re-read my previous comment again, Chang.    You were claiming that 淘寶 (taobao - chinese ""amazon"") price is cheaper than 華強北 (huaqiangbei - biggest electronics market in the world) one by 10-20% and _reliable_. I call you on it, because it is simply not true. Well first thing with online shopping is: unless you going for the 官網 (official) shops, there's always a risk of getting a fake product, or a second-hand product, or whatever you don't want to get when you buying your stuff. Sure most of the shops have 7-15 days return/exchange policy, but most of the customers can't tell the difference between fixed from the parts iPhone or Samsung S9 or whatever is hot on the market (yes, those MIX2 by xiaomi are getting made out from the spare parts in the yannan road slummy buildings as we speak), fake batteries, fake displays, etc etc.  The point I was trying to make is that if you know what you looking for and if you know the price, which I stated in my previous comment is lower than taobao/jd/whatever other 平臺 price. It's moving online yes, but if you buy small amount (i.e. 1 motherboard instead of 1k units) you still would get better price in the office of the trading company or factory stall. It also more reliable as you can see with whom your transaction is, and you can check the actual parts in your hand before the transaction.  As for the 快遞 (courier companies), yes they are convenient and cheap. But have nothing to do with the point I was trying to make in my original (1st) comment. HQB cheaper than taobao. To be frank there are HQB shopping boards online, but most of the time for the first transaction people just come in person. Then business over Tencent's WeChat.  And for the most Chinese who lives outside of canton, I feel sorry :p Just kidding. Hence the original message ""depends where in china you are"" and ""lucky enough to be in Guandong"" parts. And trust me it's not as easy as stated, of course you can build up a PC in 三號路 of Shenyang city and fix your phone screen in Sanya, heck you can do it almost anywhere in China, but for the specialization... I doubt you can (sic!) easily buy most of the components makers use on daily basis in Beijing's 中關村 (Tech mecca in capital of people republic of China)  for the same price and availability you have comparing to SZ HQB.  Overall don't get my message in the wrong way. I get what you saying, and most of it is on point and true. With exception that online shopping prices are 10-20% lower  than HQB.",7년 전,2,
@changbig7316,"Derek Freeborn 10%-20% lower price is based on the suppose that the consumer visiting real shop is a noob, the price for a same stuff is variable to different consumers, merchants are always smarter than comsumers.  As for the fake and double hand stuffs, what i know is most of them selling oneline are make by HQB, taobao and jd used to sell fake and double hand stuffs, but it is about 3 years ago, nowadays if you get a fake or double hand stuffs online you have the right to gain a 3-10 times compensation, beside of it, the merchants will lose the right to open a shop in they whole life. so merchants oneline are afraid to sell fake nowadays. I am living in Shenzhen, it is just 30 mins from my home to HQB, what i know is no one of my friends nearby want to buy electric product at HQB,because there are too many fake with the normal price there.",7년 전,1,
@dfreeuns,"Okay, I am seriously urging you to re-read my first comment. ""if not total 菜鳥"" part (for other readers here, 菜鳥 means ""noob"" in this context).  Yes you are absolutely right, if you can prove that your product is fake or second hand (二手 in english, not double 雙手) you can close up the shop and get something something for the compensation. But we not talking about ""beats by dre"" or some ""adidas knockoff"", mobile market is quite huge, people buying 港貨 美貨 日貨 等 phones all the time, you realize you cannot prove those are straight from the official shops (most of them are not), that batteries, displays, cases, etc weren't changed. And its just on little side of it. HQB is an electronics market, say you want to buy a battery how can you tell authentic or not, straight out of factory or just another disassembled phone for parts? You make it sound like it's already done, no fakes, bright future, but reality is different, especially if you are in the tech hardware industry, it is ongoing battle.  As for living 30 minutes from HQB, nice. Do you live in nanshan or in outer city? :)  As for your friends circle, well, not everyone is suited for bargaining (its exhausting), not everyone connected with merchants or trading companies or factories reps, it's perfectly fine. I just go on the limb here and call 'em 菜鳥s based on your statement there. Nothing wrong with that, I do have similar people in my circle, yet not all of them are like that. Literally everyone in makers community in my circle would prefer to go to HQB instead of online shopping. There are other types of people who would choose HQB over taobao, ESPECIALLY the ones who once worked in HQB before (starting from stall clerks going all the way up).  On the side note, close to off-topic, HQB is much MUCH bigger than just those small stalls downstairs ;)",7년 전,3,
@dfreeuns,"They also don't pay rent for storage?

@QuotableMediaGroup,"Hope you enjoyed slumming it in China, Linus, looks like you went to one of the more expensive (and better quality places) for computer parts. When I landed in Changsha, the first computer place I found had sawdust over half the glass kiosks, piles of old motherboards ontop of each other reaching up higher than the counters and video cards stacked on each other from the counters to nearly the ceiling.

Foreigner 400% 'discount' plus + 100% extra for some very bad Chinese and inability to be specific about what you're looking for.  Funny thing, is this is my first experience with stranger parts and now I feel like I'd rather watch him. I hope Linus learns that even half the first price is too much if you want to bargain in China before he comes back. Of course the prices are almost the same as buying in America. They can look online and find out the price a 外国人 expects just as easily as you. The Chinese can internet in English or Chinese, but only Stranger Parts seems like he'd know how to enter pinyin into TaoBao or JD.com",7년 전,1,
@dfreeuns,"Well even though I call Stranger Parts a clueless gwailo hobbyist, I actually quite like him and subscribed to his channel, mostly for entertaining purposes, although it carry educational ones as well for those who have no idea how stuff is made, how markets are, etc. I'd shake his hand for sure, if bump into him in HQB or SZ :D  I do recommend subscribing to Stranger Parts channel ;)  As for the video, yes, you're on point. The major mistake there not even ""bad Chinese"" (although it really really helps to speak the language, especially when it comes down to money), I'd say ""inability to be specific about what you're looking for"" is the biggest no-no, when you go to electronics market, especially HQB one.",7년 전,1,
@QuotableMediaGroup,"Well in Tier 1 cities like Shanghai, Shenzhen, Beijing, you can get by with this level of Chinese and not expect too many ripoffs. At the end of my 4 years in China, I got to see how much I'd been ripped off the for first two years. Made me happy I was mostly buying keyboards and monitors and cheap stuff you can' get ripped off on too much. Then end of my 4 years, I had assembled a full Hackintosh with SSD, dual raid 0 SSHDs, 16 GB ram and a bunch of accessories including a 200cm projector. Probably about half the price of building a moderately good computer in Canada if I only count the final parts in it. Maybe about the same if I count the first two cases, the first two power supplies and the first 8gb of ram. Half of which ended up in a PC I gave to a friend on my return.  So for maybe about the same cost as a computer in Canada, I built a Hackintosh that's still running nicely with 1GB of VRAM and 16GB of ram a server for my friend with 8gbs. Buy the tiny stuff especially anything USB from online sellers unless it's flash memory and that helps ALOT. Wifi cards, standard accessories, spindle drives. Always buy flash memory and power supplies from a local place with a receipt to return it. Buy cases wherever you find the style you like, but make sure you know the size of PSU that will fit in it.

I guess people at that time find it very easy to learn a foreign language especially when they were having a weapon pointing to their head if they don’t speak the mother tongue language of the colony ruler. That is why that particular language is way more common and easy to understand nowadays in your own country.  Fortunately, Chinese culture and language can make it through the modern age but Chinese would never have to take up the white man’s burden mindset: “Everyone should speak Chinese”.

@NanashiHaku,"English is pretty much the world's lingua franca, a universal language countries expects each other to speak by default. A Chinese person and a Korean person would most often find themselves conversing in English. Though of course there are the cases where one actually spent the time learning the other's language, but by default and by public education standards, when they meet, they would most often not know each other's language and would end up conversing in English.  Singapore and Malaysia have so many different languages inside their country that one of the lingua franca IS Chinese, so no, Chinese isn't impossible or not logical to learn, if the history is there, people would, and can learn it. However, the two countries also have another Lingua Franca: English, something used to communicate with countries without Chinese history. From a linguistics point of view, Chinese IS harder to learn than English.  English just happens to be the language used in the U.S, Canada, Australia, and Europe and it just happens to be their mother tongue, you can't mark them for being entitled for that. A day's shopping trip in China shouldn't grant them the hatred of ""if you're visiting our country, you should learn our language."" A 6 month or a 1 year trip? Then yes, you HAVE to learn the language and the culture, but a day? Hell no.  I'm Chinese and I watched this video and found nothing out of the ordinary about his attitude besides the fact that he's foreign and clearly rushing so his attempts at haggling usually ends him up without much legitimacy or a large enough discount. Though I don't think people will up the price just to fok with him since he's got a camera pointing the entire time.   tbh I was quite surprised by the animosity in the comment section. I was more annoyed at the fact that a Chinese retailer working at ""China's hardware Silicon Valley"" doesn't know the word ""laptop."" Regardless of how  less you learned in mandatory schooling, English is indeed the go to universal lingua franca and China, in contrast to common misconceptions, houses a load of foreigners, and even more if you count tourists like him. I wouldn't expect it from the older generation, but it was more surprising that a youngster like that fat glasses guy was incapable of speaking basic English.  After saying that though, to be fair, I do understand the sentiment against Linus here. He's just a typical entitled white tourist that's witnessing a different ""normal"" than he's used to. He's just interacting with cultural differences through a lens of the west (comparing everything with how things are back home). However, this is normal for everyone, it's just how humans are built, you look at new things and try to analyze and understand them based on prior knowledge.   In the United States, my parents wouldn't stop biching about how the food is trash, unbalaced, and even the Chinese food is not Chinese enough. When they came to visit me in Japan, they wouldn't stop fangirling over how clean the streets are (compared to both the US and China) or how convenient the public transport is (you can literally take a public local train from Kumamoto, Kyushu, the most southwestern island in Japan, to Sapporo, Hokkaido in the most north eastern island in Japan, albeit with many transfers). Point is, people will see what they want to see, and what's on the surface, and always compare it with how things are back home. Linus was rushing, which enhanced his irritability, which magnified his dickishness. Despite that though, I don't think he deserves all this hate since it's just normal human nature and all of us have done something similar or will when traveling.",7년 전(수정됨),1,

@eParrotorg,"Is this a case study of ""what NOT to do""?  This was entertaining because of the 'OMG - the stores are closing... QUICK! Let's spend some money!' Yes, we have no plan or experience, we only have borrowed cash, what could possibly go wrong?  Next time, don't buy anything except food on the first day at the electronics market. And having only two or three days does not do justice to the shopping experience. The place is simply too big. It is actually far, far bigger than you think. Lacking a plan of what you want and rushing at the last possible moment to ""buy something"" is silly. And then to compare prices is just wrong. You already did every possible thing wrong and paid full retail at a wholesale market.  I'm American and live a few subway stops from the HuaQiangBei electronics market. I prefer to shop online at Taobao.com (it's a bit like Chinese Amazon). Tons easier to find what you want than trying to locate it at the market, prices are more competitive since the vendors are all trying to offer the lowest price to get the sale, and shipping is crazy quick and cheap - sometimes delivery is the very same day. Plus, the Taobao community is quite vocal about the products' quality and the service of the vendor. Going to ANY large market without a well thought out plan should only ever happen if you plan to buy Nothing.  And if the item does not display a price, you are a foreigner, and don't speak the language...  well, grab the Vaseline and bend over. Why do you think they don't put price tags on their stuff? Its because there is still some Vaseline left in the jar.   You took, what to most people would be a once in a lifetime experience, and rushed through it like a virgin on prom night.

Move on to the next booth. If they do however say a price lower than their best price, you are in for a haggle. Go up 10-20 on your haggle price of 250. They will probably stay firm at the price they just said. Go up 10-20 more. If they still go no lower, attempt to leave. If they don't stop you or lower their price, move on. This is the haggle game, it isn't easy but it's one way to get a fair deal in a market of overpriced, sometimes knockoff, stuff.

@shawnstamback6351,This is how silicon valley used to be.  I remember as a kid we would go and buy cheap computer parts and build gaming computers for a little of nothing.  You didn't need to fly to china for this we did it right here in America.  I have to admit though the Chinese do it on a much larger scale and more centralized.  I think its great you can go to a mall and all the PC stuff is under one roof.  Cant wait to travel to china and see this.  Thumbs up to china for one upping us.  To me this would be heaven strolling around in there for hours on end.  Just think you could walk out with your dream PC without waiting for shipping.,7년 전,0,

The reason with prices being high may because the price is just that high(I checked the prices in JD.com, Kingsdom fury 8GB is 659rmb), partly because this crypto mining thing going on, partly because taxes and tariffs are really high here.   And that market have fake products for sure, although most people buying fake stuff knows what they are getting, they just want the cheaper ones, and the law is loose when it comes to fake products. so you need to know what you're doing, and check what you're getting. Of course you can also go to decent shops or online to buy legit products without too much worry.  And I'm sure you can build a cheap PC less than 1000 dollar, but you have to plan first and get a translation guy who knows that market. this is just what happens when you jump straight into a unknown massive foreign market without preparation.",7년 전,0,

He will not send you ( out of respect ) to the highest dirtiest floor in the building ( where you always should go first to get closest to the rear of everything ), but to the shiny first floor with all the boring brands shown. So next time starting at the 5th or higher floors: go with a Chinese speaking computer knowledgable guy, who can transfer your objective ( question to ask: I want to make a PC with no name ( no famous brand ) components ), do you think that is possible and can you help me / us? ). Approach first PC repair shops, 2nd hand components shops. There the people have the widest knowledge and they are not limited in selling only their stuff particularly.

To find the parts you need, you'd go from one shop to the other, fetching pricing lists which would be readily and handy supplied in front or right outside each shop, and then go from there .. compare price lists and so on.  Buy a hard drive, a new DVD drive, some more RAM and maybe upgrade your power supply to prepare for a newer, faster graphics card? Go to Schillerstraße and see what you can get!

@FrederickZh,"I'm afraid this is not the proper way to shop in Chinese electronic malls. Typically before you even pop up at the mall, you should've got a clear goal -- even better a list -- of the stuff that you'd like to buy. Then instead of purchasing them separately from different booths, you can simply ask one booth to provide a quote of all the components. Usually they've got the pipes with other booths so they can bring down the overall price. If the price is inappropriate, simply move on to another booth. Cos all of them actually gather the items here and there, the quote would be stabilised after visiting 3 or 4 booths (and you'd find even many booths that you haven't visited may know what you want -- because of the ""pipes""!).

My comments were unusually harsh by my standards I am very careful about what I post and this time I let go. There has to be a reason for it and I think I know why.   I saw myself in this video. Linus tried to manage the anxiety of travel and work and it was too much. I've been ""there"" under far less stressful circumstances and when overwhelmed I had the option of taking a day off to chill.  I could have been Linus here (the anxiety not the talent)  and that truth makes me uncomfortable.   The other aspect to my visceral reaction to the video was due to how interested I was with the content.  That place was like a wonderland for me... crazy bits of electronics, cheap gadgets and components that you just wouldn't see anywhere.  I could have gotten happily lost in that market in China for days. When Linus didn't connect with the experience I thought he totally missed the point and in a way his disinterest and disappointment alienated me.. Watching Scotty trying  to manage Linus' diminishing expectations was hard to take.   That was the cognitive dissonance that I felt before posting my comments. On one hand Linus' stress was relatable even if I would prefer to deny it and at the same time his dissapointment with the market was completely unrelateable based on my personal interest.    At any rate, Linus is amazing.  I have huge respect for his talent.  I can relate a little more to his humanity -  even the less than attractive bits.  I just wish he could have made a bit more of the opportunity that he presented with this video. I was hooked.",7년 전(수정됨),3,

@ilducedimas,I do not particularly like Linus but I have to defend him a little bit here. I can relate to the frustration. I used to go to Pantip Plaza in Bangkok which is a similar place (but of course smaller). You do get overwhelmed and excited at first but then you quickly become so disappointed by the prices and the overall shopping experience and hard access to what you actually look for. Don't forget also that being jetlagged and disoriented while having to browse thru these mazes of stores is really an experience that would bring out the worst of anybody... Not to mention the fact of having this ominous feeling of being overcharged. It takes time to adjust to the asian experience.,7년 전(수정됨),199,

Sometime, ignoring that I was getting 1-2 shitty games (like when I got Superman 64. yup...)  All those sellers offering ""cheap official"" Nike or Adidas clothes... where the logo was reversed or clearly wrong.

@desxse,"I guess not. There are a lot of black merchant who 'helps' people to build shit PCs in China. You could pay thousand dollars for a PC that with GTX 650, 750 or 950 if you don't really know the price for graphic card and cpu. It's not like a smartphone. People usually can't build their own smartphone, but it's really easy to build own PC. Or I can say all the pc is build by even private or some company that sell the whole  PC, because all the parts on the computer are products which is not like the accessories in the Phones! Mobile phone manufacturers don't sell accessories. So, the only way to save the money for building a cheaper PC is to buy a ES(Engineer Sample) CPU, it's much more easy to buy it in China then American. For cheap graph card? I have no idea. And best way to buy parts for PC is go to https://www.jd.com/. It's the best Shopping site in china.  For my experience, I think it's cheaper to buy a DIY PC in America then in China.

@Lilithe,"20:42 @ Everyone seems to be freaking out in the comments about this ribbing and yeah it might seem harsh, but this level of ribbing seems normal to me between friends. I'm assuming Linus was trying to engage in friendly banter here.  It's definitely a bit harsh but I think the bigger problem here was the expectation and stress level. It's also what makes this the PERFECT VIDEO to illustrate the experience of going into a foreign market unprepared and expecting to get things done.  If you go into a market in a place where the primary language is one you don't speak at all, or only know a little, with customs you don't keep or understand, you're going to have a harder time.  Take it slow. If you want to build a PC maybe work on one component per day and just go to the market each day scoping prices. Take someone who knows what they're doing. Take your time and try to not stress. Enjoy the local food!  I bet if I had more than a week in Taipei I could have found a much better deal on computer parts than when I had only 1 or 2 opportunities to see the market and understood no Chinese. (Taipei tends to be better for that though.)  I see below that someone responded in Chinese with a pretty similar take. I don't know how much better of a deal you can get, and probably not much. I think at this point these markets are very tight on margins. But it could probably be a lot more fun. :)",7년 전,0,

When they say $100 for 8GB ram, you don't look so offended / surprised, but bargain - politely reply that prices have come down and I offer you $20, which is a great deal. He'll say buy 2 x 8GB for $60 or something and you just bargain on and on. It's the culture.",7년 전,0,

@MisterTotallyNotVain,"To be fair to Linus, these kinds of places are VERY exhausting and frustrating to explore, especially when it's your first time and you have absolutely no idea where to find exactly what you're looking for. We have these exact same kinds of markets in my country too (as in, also filled with Chinese-run businesses and SEVERAL identical-looking malls full of booths), and even someone like me can get really frustrated trying to navigate around these places. My first time going to one took me an entire day (very early morning to late afternoon) to find what I needed, and that was after doing research beforehand.  I think this was also briefly mentioned in the video, but the culture in these markets is different from what someone like Linus is probably used to. People in these places actually expect you to haggle, and they'll most likely overcharge you if they realize that you have no idea what you're doing, especially if you're a foreigner. As a buyer, it's actually a very legitimate tactic in these places to tell a merchant that you'll ""check out other stores first before deciding"" to get a discount. The merchant will almost always mark down whatever you were interested in just so they can get your business. (In the video, this happens in 5:19)   I can't begin to imagine how stressful/overwhelming all of this would be for someone who also has difficulty communicating with the people around the place (I know he had a translator, but that doesn't really make it any less stressful). Linus definitely could've been a little more calm here, but I don't blame him.",7년 전,2,

@ViktorLox,"This is not correct. Apple didn't have the right components to fix his iMac as it's a reasonably new device, if they had, they'd probably fix it. Sure, it still isn't good practice from Apple's side to release a product without having a decent repair structure in place but it's not like they didn't want to fix it.",7년 전,0,
@Tecra-md3by,"Vikkie Lolo Yes, it is correct. A company as huge as Apple simply can not act this unprofessionally. They released a product that they surely expected to be sold in for several thousand people, did they really not expect it that people would accidentally break it? Especially for a thing that they call ""Pro"", meaning that it would be used by people who would actually work on it, do things that would make it sweat, or would be used in offices where more than one ppl could access it one way or another, imagine the cleaning lady accidentally knocking it over or something. Apple simply released a product that they expected to be sold in huge numbers and therefore would get damaged in huge numbers, and they simply didn't prepare for that, they didn't give a shit about it. And again, okay, a simple, average person buys it, breaks it and they refuse to fix it, what do they lose? That that person will not buy more things from them, it is like that you lose 5 cents, you don't even notice it, but companies would buy it in huge numbers, if they refuse to repair their machines, they lose a lot of profit possibly. Imagine that in that video Linus was talking about how Apple had the best customer service ever, how many potential customers Apple could've gained, and with that, profit? Probably a few hundred or thousand more than what they would've lost by repairing that iMac, even for free. But Apple can be such an asshole of a company to do this, since what the hell most of their customers are just buying their products because it is cool. Even if the product is a garbage, it was expensive so it makes them cool...",7년 전,2,

In western countries we use to be wait for the seller discount deals, bargain price will only happened in used item deals. In asia, they do all the times even brand new item. Seller want the maximum profit while buyer want to get minimum out of their pocket, bargain price for the fair price to make both side happy.

But if you bargain try to make the seller think this buyer is not rich and  not dumb to fool with they may  keep lower down the price.

When Louis Rossman talked about you after you went to his store, he said that you were probably a good guy, I also thought you were a cool guy who knows a lot, but now I think we're both wrong. You're just an idiot who spends money on technology, or advertises products that nobody really needs. I feel that that smile of yours is just a grimace that you put in front of the camera.

@skychaos87,"He was bad mouthing the products in front of the store managers, although they didn't understand him but it doesn't change the fact that he was being rude in the way he speaks. Also, he is showing his frustrations throughout the whole video, messing up the mood. The thing is, that his frustrations are not legit. He did not understand the shopping culture, and he did no homework on the operating hours of the mall or the layout of the shops. He has no one but himself to blame, yet again, he kept showing his frustration as if people owed him. The worst part is when he made snide remarks on his partner at 20:42, yes you may think its a joke but its a terrible one given the lousy mood he setup. Also, the way he handled the parts is horrible, being very rough and unwilling. For him to be assembling the parts in open public seems to me that he just wanted to get it over and done with. It comes across to me as thou he is insincere about the whole thing.   You need to know that other countries, those in Asia like to sell their products above MSRP or market price. Its their culture for buyers to bargain for a good price, not just computer parts, it happens even in wet markets when they buy groceries. In China, this has been a culture since ancient times. Linus simply did not understand the buying culture and was stressing himself out because he was running out of time. I don't know about you, but in my country, it cost more than $100 for a basic 8GB ram. I'd never make the mistake of expecting the same pricing when buying in other countries.  Lastly, this video is poorly done. Chances are Linus could have bought those parts at a cheaper price had he went there earlier and tried to bargain. He would have more or better products to choose from had he done the homework on the places they were at and the local products. This video doesn't really reflect on the shopping experience in China, and the information aren't exactly accurate either.",7년 전,1,
@hawkeyemihawkgettingmoneylord,Unity The future is lol idk know if you notice this but this a video exploring Chinese market so of course when he sees something retarded of foreign to him he’s gonna share his views to the people watching he’s not gonna stay quiet who would watch a video like that   Then your bitching about him trying to rush making the pc first of all he didn’t even want to build it there but the guy said it was okay  if they take their sweet ass time it’s gonna became night half way through the damn build Linus is a damn professional who’s made hundreds of PCs he knows what he’s doing. Your basically saying he’s rude because he didn’t do enough research but that’s A retarded requirement because nobody who’s visiting a Country will know 100% of the culture plus unlike most people he has multiple guides to translate for him and tell him how things work he’s already knew about the markets here that’s why you see him trying to negotiate. Then you say he should have came earlier like how the hell do you know he wasn’t doing something of importance? That’s why he couldn’t go right when the mall opened he’s obviously there for business and that probably the explanation.And by your explanation the sellers in China are damn crooks I know the sellers will ask for more they paid for the item they’re selling but a basic has 8g memory for 100$  I bet the speed of that is not even 2400hz they just market up the price by 50% I bet he only charged that much because he’s not from China. Any one who would sell ram for 100$ is A crook and plus that guy fucked him over with the gpu   20:42 the guy made a reference to gang bang what the he’ll Else is he supposed to do but make a joke out of it you want Linus to say hell yea that’s gang bang this wtf dude your just find reasons to complain at this point.,7년 전,1,

@skychaos87,"""when he sees something retarded of foreign to him he’s gonna share his views"" What exactly is retarded? All i see is different culture and Linus keep making rude remarks simply because things are foreign to him.  ""Your basically saying he’s rude because he didn’t do enough research"" No dude, i'm saying he is rude because he IS rude. You don't go up to people's store and criticize their products. No one is forcing you to buy, your lack of understanding on other's culture does not justify the frustration. He is not going there on a holiday, he is going there with a mission to make a video to show how people can buy computer parts at a cheaper rate. For him to conclude the buying price to be the same as his own country is inaccurate and lack of effort when he did no homework at all. All he is showing is the situation of a clueless guy going into a place trying to buy stuffs without being able to communicate properly with the shops and yet expects the same shopping experience at home. This is a video lousily done, nothing professional, more like his own personal travel blog.  ""you say he should have came earlier like how the hell do you know he wasn’t doing something of importance?"" How is that supposed to be an excuse? If he can't spare time to do this he shouldn't do this at all, it tarnishes his professionalism. Just look at the sentiments people get from watching this video. He should have rename the video as his own travel blog and people wouldn't care that much.  ""And by your explanation the sellers in China are damn crooks I know the sellers will ask for more they paid for the item"" That is an arrogant and self centered statement. MSRP is manufacturer suggested retailer price, it is not absolute that vendors or shops must sell it at fixed prices. Different countries have different pricing, like i said, in my country http://www.fuwell.com.sg/uploads/misc/20180504234726.pdf this is the kind of prices(in SGD) we usually pay for computer parts. You would be an idiot if you come to my place asking for the same pricing as your own. More so, i've explained to you that it is their culture to jack up prices and its your right to make a bargain. There is nothing wrong here except that you keep insisting your own ways to be the standard there.  ""the guy made a reference to gang bang what the he’ll Else is he supposed to do"" Just laugh it off dude, Strange-Parts did not make any derogatory remarks. Why does Linus feel the need to make snide remarks in return? It doesn't make sense at all there, Linus is not even being funny there.  Sure the experience is understandably unpleasant for Linus, but make no mistake, most of which is his own fault and that he could have avoided had he done his research. It just doesn't justify the poor energy and mood he keeps throwing on others.",7년 전,0,

@hawkeyemihawkgettingmoneylord,Unity The future is so because you didn’t like the video he shouldn’t have done it lol yea right I enjoyed this video and I’m glad he showed me this market   I already understand how the Chinese market works I already know most of the things their is not gonna cost the exact same has America but if you payed attention to the video most of the stuff was actually in fact comparable to American prices infact some stuff were cheaper. But your not mentioning how some vendors were legitimately trying to rip off the foreigner and most of them were selling knock off items with insane prices for example the psu was obviously a knock off Linus pointed it out it was way to light for 750 watt suply I and again you not gonna sit there and tell me that ram stick is just the Chinese pricing I’m not that gullible and Linus wasn’t either the Chinese was trying to rip him off simple as that   Second the mission was not to build a pc I’m really starting to wonder if you watched this whole video they were there just to buy some random gadgets half way through they decided to build a pc for fun   And basically because Linus didn’t laugh at the joke he’s being rude that makes perfect sense dude,7년 전,1,
@skychaos87,"""because you didn’t like the video he shouldn’t have done it lol yea right "" Nice try but that is not what i said, I've been as objective as possible pointing out Linus rudeness in his behavior. Sure you can have no problem with it but it doesn't change the fact that he was rude and he hasn't done his homework before going there, which led to an unprofessional video, a misinformed one.  ""if you payed attention to the video most of the stuff was actually in fact comparable to American prices infact some stuff were cheaper."" Yes that is true, but it still does not justify the broad assumption of thinking all products in China should cost cheaper. There were periods before where RAM yields were low and the price went up due to lack of supply. You don't even know if the stores were low on stocks thus the pricing. Heck, you don't even know the market price of RAMs in China are.  ""But your not mentioning how some vendors were legitimately trying to rip off the foreigner and most of them were selling knock off items"" Yes some are, like the OEM GPU that definitely wasn't legit. The power supply model is 1800W but is rated at 1600W, so the store keeper wasn't lying. Linus simply had a different standard of judgement. Regardless, his attitude was generally bad and uncool throughout the whole video not just targeted at a few stores and THAT is the problem here.  ""basically because Linus didn’t laugh at the joke he’s being rude that makes perfect sense dude"" Again, nice try at twisting my words. I specifically said Strange-Part's joke wasn't a derogatory one, even if it was a bad joke Linus should not have responded with a snide one. Its Linus's joke that is rude, not because he didn't laugh.",7년 전,0,

His joke was a rude one, be it funny or not is up you the individual but still, its a rude joke. Just look at all the comments around here, i'm not the one having such sentiments. I'm being objective here, you are the one that is trying to rationalize his poor behavior by twisting my words.  ""plus ram prices are bad in America as well but that was a Extreme price rate they were able to find so ram for cheaper so really your trying you best to defend a scam artist"" You are making an assumption when you say they are scam artist without evidence. I already told you, RAMs in my country are legitimately more expensive than even the price quoted in this video. How in the hell do you know what are the actual market price of RAM in China? Also, quoting a price is not a scam, you have the option to bargain or choose not to buy. Its you that is nonsensical to expect your own standard of pricing to be the standard of China, and worst, you expect the shopping experience to be the same too.",7년 전,0,
@BihgShiddyWok,Unity The future is speak like an adult. Lol look at the life moderator over here. Just made a rude remark to my remark by being the butthurt one. Good try though. And the vendors in chinese stores like these are known to be crooks. Thats why they try so high from the start. To rip off unsuspectings. Then if you know its off theyre quick to drop the price substantially. I said you dont know linus. And you dont know strange parts. Therefor you do not know thier relationship. Youre trying a little too hard to be the cool kid of this comment thread. When you speak of arrogance. I stated what these vendors are known to be. You stated your THOUGHTS on how someone talks and acts. You speak of nothing but speculation. I was right by you not knowing them therefore you do not know how they joke together. Linus said nothing out of line and you're still blowing it out of proportion. Youre the kind who is scared of the people who speak thier true mind at all times. Youre making rude comments and assumptions about linus' personality.  So grow up a little then i will have an adult conversation with  YOU. Grow your mind a little. And make sure not to be a hypocrite next comment.,7년 전,0,
@skychaos87,"William corely ""And the vendors in chinese stores like these are known to be crooks."" And people like you are known to make groundless accusations. You are the hypocrite here telling people not to make assumptions when you don't prove what you say. Do you even know the market price of those products? Did Linus do his homework(obviously he didn't) to know if those prices were unjust?(well then again, Linus only complaint about prices being expensive, its you who make the baseless claim that they are crooks and scams). Do you know computer parts in my country are legitimately higher than what is quoted in this video? It would be idiotic to come to my place and behave like how Linus did. Likewise, if a person goes to Canada and start criticizing the stores because they get computer parts cheaper in their own country. To how i see, you expect a cheaper price because its China and throws tantrum by calling them crook when you don't get what you want.  ""I said you dont know linus. And you dont know strange parts. Therefor you do not know thier relationship."" I don't but that still doesn't change the fact that Linus made a rude joke on Strange-Parts. You may like the joke and i don't, still doesn't change the fact that its a rude joke and that people don't feel comfortable with it.  ""I stated what these vendors are known to be."" What you think to be is not what are known to be, your opinions does not justify your slander. Much less justify Linus's rudeness there. Try showing evidence and proofs that the vendors Linus visited was trying to cheat him and then we'll talk, if not you are just trying to slander the vendors in a very poor attempt to defend Linus.  ""You stated your THOUGHTS on how someone talks and acts. You speak of nothing but speculation."" LOL, pot calling the kettle black? You are the one that is making baseless accusations all these time. Linus IS rude to be criticizing the products in front of the store, them not understanding English doesn't mean its okay. Linus's joke is based on rudeness and that is a fact, you enjoying or accepting the joke doesn't mean its not rude one.  ""I was right by you not knowing them therefore you do not know how they joke together."" What has that to do with the argument at all? Even if they are friendly it doesn't mean everyone else have to accept the joke. People have their own views, you like the joke that's fine, and so its fine too for the mass out here to not liking his joke.  ""Youre making rude comments and assumptions about linus' personality."" LOL, how have i been rude to Linus, care to point that out? I'm not making assumptions, i am making observations and doing so objectively. You are the one that is letting your feelings and emotion get in the way rationalizing Linus rudeness.  ""Grow your mind a little. And make sure not to be a hypocrite next comment."" If you haven't realize already, your way of argument is hardly objective. You keep painting a picture assuming that i am being opinionated with my argument and refuse to argue on point. You can keep lying to yourself making these kind of self-gratification comments all you want, it won't make the conversation any more meaningful.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

The fact that there is so much stuff with no particular structure on how to go about it is part of the problem, then the prices, and also language barrier problems.

Altho it dint seem clear, it looked like Linus had only 1 day with Scotty to complete this, but im sure if Linus had the idea of a rendering machine pretty early on, Scotty or his chinese friends would have found the best shops to find Chinese branded hardware.  For anyone looking into shopping there, be prepared. If I go back to Shenzhen, ill buy the book: ""The Essential Guide to Electronics in Shenzhen"" by Bunnie Huang. and/or find atleast a Tech oriented friend that can do Chinese very well, and knows the place. staying for more than a week ill probably use Taobao aswell (very succesfull experiance buying my laptop, Xbox360 devkit and a FPGA board from taoboa :D )",7년 전,0,

@zukaro,"This makes me really want to visit China. ;o;'' We don't really have markets like this in Canada at all (only place I can think of being remotely like this is Pacific Mall, but as far as I recall not in terms of electronics).  Something about the Chinese markets (and being able to haggle on every price) is just really nice. And just how everything is there, and how it's just regular people selling these things rather than large companies. It's just more genuine feeling I guess? I know of course, it means you're also more likely to pay a massively different price than someone else for the same thing of course, but still.  Also I like Strange Parts; first video of his I saw was the building the phone thing--it was really cool and interesting (haven't been keeping up though so if he's posted anything else I'll have to take a look soon). Always makes me wanna visit these markets. :P Just the fact he was even able to build his own phone by going out to the shops was awesome to me.   As for Linus' struggling, I think that kinda place is one where you really have to take your time, and haggle the prices a lot more. Obviously it'll be stressful if you're rushed, as nothing is organized; but I think that's part of the charm, and I wish we had more of that in Canada. Of course, I order everything online anyway (cuz I barely leave the house :p) but still. 'w';; Would be fun to go with my friends to such a place.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

After that it was fully virtual. Basically the medic put in the system a PDF with your prescription under your a section of your medical record and that section is shared by all of the para/pharmacies in your state. You go there with your INPS card (tessera sanitaria) and they give you the drug prescripted to you. If you want the file you have to bring your own memory stick/usb flash since they a) cant send that file on/from any email b) cant print that file. So it actually have sense for a pharmacy to sell memory flash/usb drive. Especially overpriced since the pdf get removed/became unaccessible as soon as you pay for the drug so you dont actually have the time to go back at home to bring your own usb/flash.",3년 전,0,

This video clearly doesn't have enough preparation before shooting and Linus just shows how ignorant and biased when he's in an environment with a totally different culture. As a DIYer (not enthusiast) and a Chinese, I know that before you go to such a place in China, you need to get prepared, not just wandering around and buying random stuff. I mean, my man, at least you could have googled it before you came to China. You even own a forum, I'm sure you'll find someone there who can tell you some ABCs about buying stuff in Huaqiangbei.

@agent_ethan,"Dominic, Chinese products are getting even more expensive than some local stores. In Europe you can find lots of chinese stores and to conquer the places, they offered excellent prices. People got used to them and they year by year they increased all of the prices. Today its pretty common to find similar prices on chinese stores compared to other places like home depot, leroy merlin, etc... Now they are doing the same tactic with eBay and other places but they will lose if they keep that tactic because other stores (non chinese) are not only offering ""cheap low quality"" products on par with high quality products, but also offer warranty for those products that sometimes are even cheaper on their stores. I find myself buying less stuff on eBay because of the prices. I remember ordering stuff that cost 2 dolars a year ago and the same thing cost today 5 dollars. More than double. Banggood for example, does so many fake discounts that I no longer trust them either. The same goes to Gearbest for example... :(",7년 전,0,

I would bet he doesn't know the fact that 50% of the PC market still uses old Core 2 Duos and i3 and Xeons on old boards to play games. He doesn't know how big a deal AliExpress is. Nothing against him though. In the US and Canada, its all about form over functionality and budget when it comes to gaming PCs and stuff. He does what he does best, that is, do some quirky stuff, find about new tech(which incidentally most come from China where he is now) and review stuff. One more thing, Linus, do you know that a 9 year old 40$ Xeon X5675 OC'd to 4.5 GHz performs the same as an 8700K at half its price for the whole platform. Just random food for thought and stuff which could actually make smart and serious enthusiasts watch your videos other than 12 year olds. EDIT- I know the tone seems harsh but trust me buddy it ain't. You are from a place where online is the way to go. China and India, now here the fun lies in going about and buying your stuff, haggling for the lowest you can get and coming back home to an awesome dinner after all that hard work.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

I have currently 27 inch monitor with full hd resolution and it is already too small for me. I was thinking about same size or bigger with 4K resolution. I mainly do programming stuff and sometimes play games but my GTX 970 and i5 8600k won't handle high/ultra settings in 4K but for sure will handle downscaled to 1080p. I am just afraid of losing sharpness. What do you think about it? Thank you in adavance for any response!,7년 전,0,

@momo-g2e6w,"Chinese fan here! So I'm gonna try and explain things a little bit here. First about component price, Comparing China and the US, the things u can get cheaper in China are:  CPUs: In this video Linus bought a OFFICIAL CPU with stock cooler, however, a local Chinese who know his ways would be choosing something different for CPU. Shop in China actually sell CPUs that we call“散片”, which are CPUs that got produced in China but DIDN'T pass the quality test and therefore should have been thrown away, but we the ""tricky"" Chinese would pick from those imperfections and sell those still in fine but not great shape. Those ""散片"" CPU would end up 0.1 or 0.2 GHz lower in performance and have less stable overclocking abilities, but still it would fit for daily use. Typical thing with these ""散片"" are that they don't come with a box and stock cooler, but they are usually 100 Yuan(20 USD) cheaper.           Also  it is also a performance-per-dollar choice to purchase SERVER CPU and motherboard combo like intel xeon E3 or G4560(of course it is not entirely legal for individuals to purchase these, so isn't ""散片"" deals, but that is the ""grey"" area for the current law.) Cases: Unlike other components, computer cases do not require any high-tech to build, so here you can see many small brands selling all kind of bizarre cases, that are cheaper and, probably, use cheaper and lower-quality materials. About the mall, 华强北 in Shenzhen:     Even though I live in Beijing, the great name of 华强北 is still famous to anyone interested in computer DIY. I think it's fair to say that it is the largest of its kind in all of China. And as you can see in the video, people there have things beyond imaginations in stock, and I'm pretty sure there are even more wired and less or more illegal products hidden in the back of their store. You can dig up pretty much anything in your wildest dreams, literally.  As one last reminder, I suggest STRONGLY that Strange Parts find a more stable power supply by a bigger brand. Because the best expert on computer DIY  in China can save money in every way for better preformance, but NONE of us ever dare to save money on power supply. Because those cheap products from tiny brands don't have very strict quality test and you don't know what key components they've replaced. In short the cheap power supply is VERY LIKELY to go KABOOM(I mean it) in the future. Let's try not to risk that, like seriously.",7년 전,2.1천,

His problem is that he is a Westerner TOTALLY ignorant of the Chinese culture who, like Alice in Wonderland,wanders around expecting China to capitulate to his foregone expectations.  And Westerners are not looked upon like they are stupid - in fact, the Chinese are rather enamored with Westerners - especially Americans who they largely respect.  And fuck your ignorant racist projections about the ""Chinese mentality"". The only one racist here are asshats like yourself who pretend to understand something about which they are totally ignorant. The closest you got to being correct is with regards to the language, for if he understood the language he would also, in the process, have learned a bit more about how the Chinese approach situations.

@momo-g2e6w,"well if we are looking at the cheapest we can get in two countries I would say about 200 yuan(40 bucks)? but that is when the gpu price are ""regular"", and as we all know the current situation is not exactly""regular"". But if you are trying to take a more ""dangerous"" path, used cards like 690 or 780 would be a better choice, which has a bigger but more risky market (think of cars on craigslist). these older models can still perform very well as long as you don't run into messed up (in many ways) ones.",7년 전,5,

@wet4242,"Chengcheng Ding  I'll give you a thumbs up! Your definition of “散片”AKA “bulk CPU” is not quite right.   Sellers who sells bulk CPUs has shop-warranty ,if something wrong to the CPU,seller will change a new one for you,which is actually more convenient than the lntel Warranty. ""Bulk CPU"" actually only for Intel CPU, the outflow method is given priority to with OEM, does not have a defective products or to use short of calibration frequency, and the differences between Boxed-CPU are only the , packing box, original cooler  , and intel warranty. Note that the bulk CPU is not ES or QS. The advantage of huaqiangbei is that it is abundant and suntle, but it is not a good choice to assemble PC. In China,PC fans usually choose the two Chinese e-commerce platforms, jingdong and taobao to buy parts. Also try not to choose the accessories of tiny  brand, mainboard,Graphicard  and power supply  is more stable if U choose famous brand like ASUS ASROCK  MSI  GIGABYTE  GALAXY  or  cooler master etc. I wish I were ShenZhen at that moment.

They've always matched prices or like 20 yuan more expensive when I did that. They will definitely try to rip you off if you don't. for example, one shop tried to sell me Corsair's cheap CS550 PSU ( non modular, ugly cables, 80+ bronze) for 700元  (they're 300 shipped at most on taobao) ended up with a Corsair RM650x ( fully modular, all black cables, 80+ gold) for just 100元 more from that same shop (paid same price as if I bought on taobao).",7년 전,0,

@DeathBringer769,"Every society has their own bullshit. It seems like a Catch-22 to expect you to buy it just because you try it, because how do you know if you truly want to buy it before you try it? Same goes for asking about price. I think Western culture not considering this as rude is actually the better, more rational case here. Though even over here in the West, at certain stores, I have had employees or managers get visibly frustrated at not landing a sale at the end of a customer/consumer interaction, but hey, that's just the nature of retail business for you... it's not the consumer's fault if they are acting within reason and not using up more of the store's/employee's time than is necessary (hanging around all day, trying tons of stuff, with no intention to buy anything, is a dick move, I will agree on that one. But just trying out something or asking for a price, then leaving, should be considered differently though if you ask me. That's ""within reason"" as I see it. The customer shouldn't be societally pressured to buy just because they wanted to try it. Trying it shouldn't be considered as you ""signing up"" for buying it before you've even gotten to try it to truly see IF you actually wanted to buy it at all.)  But hey, I understand these are just societal/cultural differences and me arguing with them isn't going to change anything. I'm just saying ;)",7년 전,2,

Just let them know you know LTT standard CPU+MB comparison and they will shut up and listen to your order items.

@michaeljarcher,"1st. Buying computers in China is for Chinese people only. 2nd. Every western person with a  brain goes to Hong Kong to the computer market(s) with prices which match or are cheaper than USA / Canada.  Just go check price.com.hk (they have an App also) for the best way to find and price match. (google translate will help) 3rd. We learn nothing on this video.except after several visits to China Linus doesn't know the currency is called  RMB, or yuan. Typical tourist, not even to learn one word like thank you would show some intelligence. Linus comes back and I'll take you to HK markets where you can get all the quality brands with a competitive price, and also Chinese brands at a lower price.  4th. Facts, domestic Chinese market products are often exported, where the factories claim back an export tax from the government, so, therefore, if they are properly registered as VAT can make money back. If not properly registered then you can buy invoices to make up the costs and still claim back money, maybe 5% on export. 5th Many products including phones are often smuggled across the HK border after being exported from China and re-sold in the local market.  This does not go just for computer parts but everything you can possibly imagine.  6p's. Proper planning prevents piss poor performance. (edited from original)",7년 전(수정됨),26,

@bassereric,"Look, as a Chinese, I do appreciate whenever foreigners come to my country and respect the local custom and culture and not bitchy about anything that's unusual to them. But at the end of the day, if you subscribed to LTT you know what his style is. And I can guarantee you, that no vendors feeling were hurt and I am sure Scotty had seen white people act like that in Huaqiangbei before. China is overwhelming for westerners and Chinese people don't like to judge people, especially when there is a language barrier. You have to play by the local rules doesn't mean you can't have personality. Trust me, if you think that's bitchy, you ain't see nothing yet, come to China and I will show you how Chinese middle age women bargain.",7년 전,5,
@bassereric,"Pay attention to the detail of this video, I am sure if Linus was out of line somewhere, Scotty will not hesitate to correct him, he's been doing that the whole video, the Yen and Yuan mispronunciation, the explanation about how vendors get parts. I mean, even as a Chinese, I feel a bit insecure when vendors do things behind the scene, I don't like it when they have to get it from the ""warehouse"" as well, it feels a bit dodgy. So I think it's perfectly okay for Linus to complain a bit as long as he didn't say anything disrespectful.",7년 전,3,

@aoelp,"+Clive Targaryen Another uninformed individual thinking Windows 7 (which is just Vista reloaded, whereas Windows 8 introduced a new kernel which just feels snappier on most machines) would never force restart any pc and does lack telemetry. The only thing new with Windows 10 is the extend of telemetry and spying whilst making it harder for the uninformed user to stop updates, which you totally can do by stopping the services. Also Windows 7 was the only operating system ever struggeling to detect funtioning drives for me which even an unpatched Windows Vista had no problems with, which actually works pretty well and stable for me since SP1 on an old laptop which had this problem. And yes, I used all official and some unofficial builds of it, but the problem persisted, even when using official drivers during setup. Even Windows ME on some machine I could not get to bluescreen, which is easy on Windows 7. However, I do not mean to badmouth Windows 7, but the ""cult"" around it is what I do not understand.

I do not rub in anyone's face that I use Windows 10 if I use Windows, just for best support with latest hardware and software. I personally use GNU/Linux way to little, partially because I haven't yet settled on a distro. I had my experiences with Ubuntu as a novice for obvious reasons, but am not really sure if it would suit me now since I am now advanced in using GNU/Linux, but still no software developer or something like that.

I also switched to windows 10 when it came out. compared to 7 it's basically: +: +DX12 support +snapping windows to screen corners instead of halfs only +use compressed .zip files like normal folders with integrated support for .zip inside the explorer +reduced boot time +windows apps like whatsapp +night mode -: -search function totally messed up -control panel is gradually being replaced with a imo more complicated menu -more SSD space -spyware(?) -worse legacy support for older games and hardware drivers -windows might randomly decide to use 90%+ of your internet bandwith for preloading updates in the background (independent from planned update times) making any online game unplayable with high ping for the update duration.",7년 전(수정됨),2,

@facebooker212,"You really should come to Mexico one day there is a place called ""Plaza de la computacion"" where you also need to haggle prices and it doesn't look so much different from that place in China, it is a nightmare to walk around but you usually find cheaper prices than retailers and stuff. Honestly after watching the video again I just realized how similar it is to here. They show you things and look for stock in other boths. The difference it is that you might get scammed here if you don't really know what you're buying, I've seen update combos for computers with I3 and GT 210 going for 186 USD dollars. To get you an idea of how is the situation here, they sell ilegal pirate software on CD's outside the building for really cheap prices.

I grew up in China and knowing how most products are manufactured and the quality there (although they have many methods to make it seems it's better than it is) you can negotiate for those good for less than half of the price more often than not. (The main reason for this is because many Chinese manufacturers ship good quality product overseas and leave behind poorer product in domestic market in China since they won't meet the standers to the Western consumers).

I'm sure Scotty and Eric kept the tensions low, being an English grounding point and knowing at least a teensy bit of Chinese.  It's a damn shame (and a real surprise!) that you wound up spending slightly more than you would have buying online. I wondered while watching Scotty's videos of making the iPhone, how much it wound up costing him? There is no doubt it was worth it, I mean, the guy's still alive, and that unit is S.I.C.K.

@EriIaz,"Yeah, shopping in China is an interesting experience. But that’s really fun if you like to discuss the price and know Chinese well. When I was studying in Shanghai, my general rule of thumb for electronics shopping was to not stress out, instead I was doing a little bit of research first, checking actual prices for what are you looking for, both global on EBay and local ones using Taobao, then to do a “recon” at these plazas, noticing who is where, sales what and how much that is, and then you need to either buy all of the components separately from different sellers, or to go for the big ones, get your entire list and discuss total price for the “bundle”.  That works wonders, and if pay a little bit of time, you certainly going to get your ROI. In three visits I actually bought a good set of photography gear, and of computer components that works in the same way. Not going to say that I got the best deal on Earth, but that tactic saved me approximately 5000RMB, which translates to 800 dollars, or 50000 actual Russian roubles at that time, not your fake Canadian ones.",7년 전(수정됨),1,

China allows companies to do this, but it requires they seek permission first. Also, Mining and trading in cryptocurrency is illegal in China, but it's unenforcable and not many people end up convicted for it. Why you ask? Because of money laundering and corruption, it's why there's no much money in Crypto, because Chinese wealthy businessmen and politicians put their money into it and buy back in USD and then convert to RMB to wash their cash.",7년 전,1,

For Guangzhou, Ive gone to a place called ""Bainaohui"" (Pretty sure they have an translated name of ""Buynow"" but no one would recognize it) and I would say there isnt as much stuff in Guangzhou as there is in Shenzhen  I would really recommend finding a translator or someone whos familiar with shopping in those markets to go with you because some merchants tend to sell cheap and overpriced products to those buyers who are confused.

@thmalex,"Comments and recommendations from a Hong Kong audience. If you want to buy a PC with a better shopping experience I recommend you buy in Hong Kong instead of Shenzhen. The mall (or more accurate: market) you visited is mainly for wholesale or computer repair and most people there are doing business via Taobao (online shopping platform in China) instead of retail sales.  Some more comments: 1. Beware of Robbers. For me I never show cash on the street in mainland China. 2. Beware of counterfeit stuffs. Maybe the show the real stuff on shelf but in fact they give you a fake one. 3. Never trust the ""80 plus"" and the Power Rate label printed on the transformer package. Most likely they are fake and under rated. 3. Personally prefer purchasing stuffs from Taobao instead of visiting the mall if you really want to buy things from China. 4. Laughed at 3:07. TBH most people in mainland China dont understand English. Helping from Dennis or Brandon is recommended. From the video credits I saw Brandon is here. I guess Brandon can speak both Mandarin and even Cantonese that can really help quite a lot. 5. 5:25 Remember to do a bargain as most of the time they mark their price higher. 6. 16:00 Watch carefully when paying by cash. People may swap counterfeit cash with you. 7. 23:40 The sponsor advertisement really surprise me. I think I should try next time when travelling to Mainland China.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

While most Motherboard is made in China mainland, some high end are built in taiwan, and most componments on the PCB is from China and other Asia countries liks Japan or Korea. Most controller chips are from taiwan like PCH, Sound and Ethernet. Graphics card chip from Nvidia are made by TSMC in taiwan and most the card usually assembleed in mainland China.
