@Jadebones," @marcushughes3012  You want the simple answer? He likes it.  You want a better answer?  When you find a tool you're comfortable with and can manipulate it ways that replaces the need for MANY tools... You tend to prefer it.  Look at the many effects he can create with a SINGLE tool: Fine lines, heavy lines, shading, fine points, blobs, blotches.... He can do all of his processes at the same time: line art, shading, details... All without having to switch tools. That particular brand though? Usually people stick with what they KNOW is consistently reliable and are satisfied with the quality it provides in the way they use the product. ____________________________  I know your question was posted a year or more ago, but I didn't really see any response.

The reason that this guy can draw things so realistically is simply because of the fact of how much time he spends drawing. Think about it, if you were to draw 50 60 70 hours every week for the last 35 to 40 years, with the exception of the two years he was in the military, you're bound to get good at it, period. Yes, he does have a great natural talent for not only artistic ability but also for memorization, but he's probably drawn every element that you see in his drawings thousands and thousands and thousands of times to the points of where he can remember every angle, every line, every detail that he needs in order to make these things look realistic.

@Megaflare99,"I first discovered kim jung gi in my early college days and the way he drew blew my mind. What he could do without any erasing, construction lines etc, is absolutely incredible. I actually got to meet him when he visited my college a couple years later which is a memory I will cherish forever. I personally believe that Kim Jung Gi was the greatist modern living artist by far, no one can do what he could do. And not just from his pure drawing skills but in the way that he has inspired all of us. I could not believe what I was reading when I found out that he passed today, he was a hero for all of us who are studying art. Rest in peace to the king, the absolute legend and a spiritual teacher to us all",2년 전(수정됨),91,

Kim jung gi directly says that his ability on drawing in 3D comes from having a better visual memory from early childhood and that key to his style of work is in habit of memorising, observing and undestanding world around him. Drawing a lot is a given, its what every artist does yet commenters act like him drawing during an interview is direct proof that the only important step to get better at drawing is drawing every second.

@estelle_elith,"Kinda tired of all these comments telling me to ""just draw"". I like to compare drawing to doing sports. Yes, you learn a specific kind of sport mostly by doing it and practicing but you also need to understand HOW you need to do it in the first place. Otherwise you would hurt yourself and stagnate in progress. If you try to teach yourself how to bodybuild i.e. you will probably take the wrong position over and over again and it will become a habit which is very bad for both, your health and progress. Some people - especially beginners in art - also dont have a nice ""observation skill"" and start to just magically understand how they need to draw things or how to simplify a portrait. They need to learn theory first. Also, every person who is kind of new or mediocre at something they want to be good or perfect at needs to inform themselves on HOW to get better by reading, researching and taking lectures. Not just repeating the same mistakes until they become a habit.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

I would always make observations around me and ask “why does that work that way?” As I grew up, I slowly realized that what I was always to curious about was physics. I think his story is similar.

I've been drawing since the age of 2 but I've never had the guts to completely neglect my studies, even though I would fail most subjects, but was still way better at drawing than the rest of my classmates. I often wonder how I didn't get as good as him, because I'm 19 and I'm still not nearly as good as he was at 17 or probably at even 15 or 16. It might be because of the generational gap, and how we're surrounded by so many more technological distractions nowadays. If I heard him correctly, he either drew or played football in school (but drew 90% of the time). Most aspiring artists from this generation are going to have a very hard time getting to this level considering the number of distractions and other possibilities that exist today. It might not be impossible, but it's definitely going to be way more difficult for us to develop the capacity to focus on drawing long enough to get as proficient at it as he is.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@yeonlee279,"As a korean who can understand the captions and sentences he wrote, his drawings feels extremely misogynistic. The reason why he has been called misogynist is not because of the nudity or 'drawing genitalia'. The word next to the girls at 3:53 is calling them '기쁨조', which is name given for sex slavery victims in North Korea. Also, in a drawing that starts from 6:16, he's calling the girls 'pizza' and blaming his students for not 'heating up' his girl while enjoying his. Yet what is more degrading is what the man on the farthest to the right is saying. He's calling bunch of girls 'bulgogi(korean barbeque dish) pizza'. 'Bulgogi' is a korean slang made to humiliate korean women, which implies korean women have pussy that is so floppy and brown, as korean dish 'Bulgogi' does. These are but a few of drawings like such, and he has been notorious for such things that is blatantly offensive and insulting to women.",4년 전,1,

Also most of my drawings were copies of photos or other drawings others have done. My imagination is limited. Anyway by the time I reached 15yo I could draw realistic faces. It's just practice.

But I do remember these becoming popular during the early 90's causing some lame infomercials for ""quick & easy"" ways to improve memory... But there are exercises that help recall, many studies I've seen in the past noted you don't really lose memories, it just becomes harder to recall memories. A good metaphor is that Gi has an organized file cabinet of memories he uses daily, people like me have packed away in boxes in the attic... Still somewhat accessible but harder to get to and hard to find which box I put what memories in.  I need a filing cabinet 😆",4년 전,0,

I had only just heard of him and was enthralled and watching every piece of detail my eyes could swallow, so, of course I asked, lots of people have. I now own a bunch of them, surprise! I’m not at his level with or without them, but, they serve a purpose and if not for him, I wouldn’t have that medium in my basket so to speak, so, thanks to him and that manufacturer. Note to his people, start a drawing and painting channel on cable. I and others would watch for hours, we wouldn’t burden him with questions, I would pay. He would get to draw without hearing my questions; next hour Bob Ross paints, then back to Kim Jung Gi, throw in a couple of sculpters like Dr. Garuda. That’s a channel on cable that I would watch a lot of and DVR. There’s nothing I like better than to draw his drawings as he’s drawing. I know I can and do watch a lot of his drawings on line, but, make it easier for me and just put it on my dish network. “Alexa...turn on the P & D Channel (Painting and Drawing).

@callumscott5107,"I want to start by saying that I'm currently no expert, but I really do think there's a huge difference in the precise mentality he has to most artists that I feel I've caught wind of a little. When I hear artists talk about learning to draw, they talk about shapes and panels and studying anatomy, but it seems like these things are really secondary for him. We see in colour and luminance, not in shapes, and he just seems to just pay attention to the image that is his own vision as though it were a drawing in itself. He doesn't think in steps and algorithms, he's just aware of things as they are manifest. Of course he can break things down into steps, but the fact he doesn't need to I think betrays that he naturally doesn't think that way. How much better would we be at art if we had a natural curiosity for noticing exactly what we are actually observing?",5년 전,0,

@single_use_planet_,"As a kid I drew so much I missed all of my elementary school, I learned practically nothing for 6 years (in France and I had to repeat 2nd grade), in the end, my teacher told me I had to go on to the next school regardless because I was way too big and I guess it was just super weird for a kid to repeat 2 years in elementary or something... he also told me if my grades would stay low I'd have to go back.......  so I got my grades up and never repeated a school year after that, but even so, I still kept drawing, in the car, in the bathroom, at school, in my bed, etc. I spent so many years and so much time drawing but instead of looking at people and memorizing how they looked like,I tried doing that with all sorts of other people's art. So it's not just about drawing a lot, observing is also important but you need to observe the real things, because at the end of the day if you can draw every single pokemon from memory but can't even draw a damn flower cause you got no idea how the petals fall, can you really draw?

Both are important;  4 - No more ideas? Back to studies. Also draw what is in front of you, as long as you're drawing, you're progressing and improving other drawing skills.  There ya go. It won't work only for drawing but for other things like cooking, maths, etc. The more you the better you get.   Good luck guys👍👍👍👍",5년 전,1.1천,

A musician hearing noise or music around them & being able to hum or internally identify chords, emotions, rhythms, colors, melody, or free improvisation along to it.... sorta sounds similar?

He enjoys it, so that's why he can do all the hard things he does. it;s not making it less hard for him, it's giving him more willpower and motivation to endure, and that my friend, is why i admire him, and why everyone should, some would get bored, some wouldn't try so hard, some would lose the patience, or wouldn't see it as something worthy, yet he did, and that's why he's who he is today",4년 전,6,

By the fact that this guy can draw these complex drawings like a master cannot be solely be blamed for his talent,. Otherwise, human history in regard to art would have progressed much faster with all these talented mutants. For this reason, I believe that most of the skills he got are acquired from learning and practice, and his talent is rather minimal. Minimal meaning other talented artists would be able to achieve what he has achieved if they would also invest as much of their time wisely like how Kim has done with his life.

They were given words of encouragement as to why they should let him join since at the time it was a matter of him begin young and worst case is if he fucked up in it, he could still pursue schooling, but ultimately they objected to it.  Some time later they were shown one of the events and how much the prize pools were.  Needless to say they regretted their choices before.  Although he is doing fine in terms of a career, they realize he could've had much more AND enjoyed what he was doing.  In the same thread, I was also denied by my parents to pursue art.  They saw I could draw very well at a young age as I was always showing them my drawings, but when it came to joining a school , the response was more or less translated to them not wanting to spend the money for it.  So most of my earlier years were spent drawing as often as I could.  I have of course gotten better over the years, but I feel that if I was given that opportunity that things could've turned out bigger.  Right now I work with computers and it's something I enjoy greatly, but I often wonder how different things would've been if my mindset and career focus was on art than computers.",4년 전,1,

@terrorazeing,"This is actually what happens when a talented person with affinity to something gets attracted to the right stuff and managed to practice non-stop in order to be a master of his own craft.  It's basically the heavenly combination of innate talent + practice. It all leads to perfection.  It's wrong to say that innate talent does not exist, because it does. People get born with unique characteristics/personalities, and those qualities help them to learn much faster in certain skills that they are attracted to. Take Jung Gi for instance. He said even since he was a kid, he was already good at drawing 3-dimensional shapes/figures, compared to his peers who are still learning to draw 2D shapes. That alone is already an evidence that he most probably has a deeper understanding of spacial awareness which would help him to learn how 3-dimensional shapes work and how they look in various perspectives.  And he already had that when he was still a kid. And believe me, that certain characteristic alone CAN'T be taught early on, especially if no one from Jung Gi's family shows interest in drawing, which obviously meant that no one actually taught him about spacial awareness.  ...And that's how innate talent works. Sure, no one is born to be gifted in a particular skillset, that is very much true because it's merely impossible. But talented people were born to have such unique qualities that would certainly help them to learn a certain skillset at a much faster rate. That's why naturally talented artists would always be able to learn to draw and  become a master of their craft at a much faster rate compared to people who aren't talented at visual arts, or in drawing to be specific. And yes, any type of skill can be learned with time, but a person who aren't talented in any type of skill that he wishes to learn would certainly have to spend longer period of their time just to be able to catch up with a talented person.",4년 전,0,

@ioncekilledamanwithmyshoe," @TheGamingg33k  no, not exactly. You’re saying he became this good purely because he practiced his skills, which isn’t entirely true. Some people are just born able to develop certain skills much faster because of what they have “pre installed” inside of their brain.  If an average kid draws as frequently as Kim Jung Gi as well as taking lessons and progresses into adulthood,  they will definitely be very good, but most likely still will not be at the same level as Kim Jung Gi when matching up skill with age. He was born with a great photographic memory, he also was born with great spacial awareness and other things that you need to understand to make art. Of course, people can be taught many of these art fundamentals, but the fact that Kim Jung Gi was born with these already pretty much built into his brain means that these things come more naturally to him and he will most likely be several steps ahead of most artists.",3년 전,0,
@ioncekilledamanwithmyshoe," @forester-b9k  lol, what you said about adults never being able to learn art is completely inaccurate.

Admittedly it is the bread and butter, and many people want to ignore that, and look for what we might call a secret but what they really want is a *shortcut*.  Another thing to consider though is that self-knowledge is rarely, if ever, complete. That is, the idea that we are all rational thinking machine the fully understand why we do what we do isn't necessarily true. In fact, I levels of self-knowledge aren't even necessarily correlated with great skill and talent I think they can be, but they might not be. In other words, this guy could be a supremely talented artist and not really know why he is. Of course he understands the technical aspects of how to draw, and can explain his technique and so on, but the Deep almost metaphysical roots of his talent may very well be something that eludes him, it may be just as much a secret to him as it is to us.",5년 전,5,

@SewageSquid,I always get so annoyed when my family constantly tells me that I’m good at art because I was born with the talent. I was born with the interest and the brain to find it fascinating and wanting to pursue it. Anyone can become an artist. It’s just taking the time to keep drawing and wanting to learn and try new things. Taking the time to actually build the skill. I was a horrible drawer as I grew up and the only reason I ever got better was because I kept drawing. The more you draw the more your brain keeps the muscle memory. The more you draw from reference the more anatomically correct and realistic things look. This guy has insane TALENT because he worked for it. His memory is good because he practiced and worked hard for what he can do. He makes it look easy because he has the most experience under his belt. People think there’s always a hack and that the people with the most talent must just be born with some superior genes but in reality anyone can become anything if you work for it. People just don’t want to put in the effort.,5년 전,1,

@yamazakitasushiro9620,"I have search for this kind of memory for 3 years.   And what i found currently is that anyone can develop abstract visualization memory up to something called photographic memory.   You need just train to visualize abstractly something. It can be color, letters, Chinese letters, photo, and anything else.   You also need to try visualize it with real proportion. So you can't just close you ayes and just start visualize, it's wrong strategy.   To visualize with real proportion draw rectangle and try to visualize something in it with real proportion size like it is in front of you.  Rectangle is foundation that will help your brain. Don't close your ayes.   It will be difficult for anyone to just sit and try to visualize. Even if you try to visualize English letters it will be difficult for you because you will find that you don't really know how they are really looks like. Use any passable references for training. You goal should be is to go from abstract to details.  And remember you can't just sit and start to visualize with details it's not even passable because you haven't trained abstract visualization. It's like to try to kill 100 level boss in game when you are at 0 level.   This is how you can develop good visual memory. it can be years to train it to some intermediate level but if you do it. it will pay off to you.   This is how many artist done it before us. You can find prove yourself. I trying to do it and now i can memorize word or Chinese letter just by visualizing it once. More you train it more details you can visualize. In the end anyone will be able to visualize a photo in almost every details.   So you can build huge visual library inside your brain.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@kastaylor01,It seems this artist is more of a idiot-savant who has directed all his energies to drawing. But after viewing some of his work all I can say is it is a good thing he drew so much or he might have ended up in jail for his obsession with sexual deviancy. So yes I am glad he just drew what he wanted and was so busy drawing he was too busy to act on his artistic thoughts. I just don’t see this as art as much as it is an outlet for his obsessive sexualizing of women.  It is great that this is what makes him happy but I do not see the benefit of sitting and watching him draw on a 10 by 22 foot piece of paper and asking him questions. It is not artistic as it is just an exercise in what is on his mind. Instead of talking and expressing himself verbally he does this with a brush pen. A real life Korean idiot-savant. To each their own.  If you can learn from him great.  But I prefer to learn from a more well rounded balanced artist with some real life background in the arts not Porn magazines.  Maybe his tile should be Master-bater.,6년 전(수정됨),1,

Having talent doesn't mean that someone will instantly be a good artist but someone with no talent wont be able to just grind themselves into being the next kim jung gi.

@button9,"EnragedFliqpy limits challenge you. Yes, you can be creative with no limits but you’re also creative when given a limit. I could list or give many examples, but I’ll do one kind of close to the subject at hand. If you tell an artist “ok, draw 10 naked women in a group” of course you’re undoubtedly going to get a lot of boobs and whatnot, which is fine but say “ok but cover their boobs without clothing” , now the artist is challenged to use composition with arms and angles and legs or shadows or whatever else to make it interesting. Like sure, some people could just be boring, but a creative mind will take that challenge and make something interesting. That’s why you can often get better movies or shows from a limited budget compared to $200m budget movies - it challenges a director to be inventive. Sometimes less is more and sometimes no limits can make things boring. You could give someone no limits and they’d be stumped what to paint, but tell them they can only paint a foot and they’ll paint you the most interesting foot you’ve seen.",5년 전(수정됨),12,

He usually draws his paper and pen or brush in the foreground to show he was there in person. I remember the presentation classroom filled with so many art students and other students from other majors just to watch him. He showed us how he approached perspective, points of view and though it was late and I remember feeling a bit sleepy, I did not want to miss anything. The next day, he visited my illustration class and it was so amazing that we could all draw on the same paper as him. It was so fun working on the banner with him, I will never forget it! Love his work!",6년 전,69,

@VictorHernandez-vc5zo,"Ppl say its a product of hard work and perseverance. Thats an insult of his shear passion. Its not work, he didnt struggle to get to where he is today. He grabbed a pen and paper, and just went at it. Like he said, he made 3 mistakes. Did he ""persevere""? No. He just drew. He gets what is on his mind onto paper. Hes bored, so he fixes his boredom by detailing and just feeling art. Instead of sitting in place with a blank mind, he observes and lets his mind do what it wants. I can only relate to the drawing in class all the time. Even now in college, i still draw in class. But everything else he is capable of doing is beyond me. His mental eye is way too superior. I still have to think every little thing i do. Meanwhile this guy gets a whole portrait done in the amount of time it takes me to think. Truly an amazing inspiration. He is not gifted, he is the embodiment of passion. He doesnt aim for an art style that is superior, he aims for an art style of his liking.",6년 전,0,

@YThates,"He actually has photographic memory and has implied it in the past. I assume he or his agrnts/publicists if he has any atm told him not to or else he wont be as popular. But he said he used to draw movies from memory as a kid and even when he uses references he doesnt need to study them just glance and all the details are in his head. He has heavily implied numerous times in the past that he has photographic memory and I remember reading an article from many years ago where the writer claims to have learned he had photographic memory, which is when the way he talks about drawing from childhood and the way he uses references started to click for me. Yeah practice helps, but for him learning wasn't hard like it is for the average person when he doesnt have to spend as much time looking up, and studying resources from poses, objects, style, etc. Going to art school only made him better at putting the images in his head on paper with rapid speed. We cannot be KJI because he literally works from his head. You can only be him with a buttload of references it's not impossible because his art style is still common and started by Japanese mangakas and also used by Korean manga/manhwa artists.",6년 전,2,

I do not denigrate Mr. Kim, because he is a master, his medium is , perhaps, one of the ones least easily managed as it has but two dimensions: black and white.

I'm assuming he draws in his head the same way he would irl so when he draws he replicates what's in his head but I'd be interested in knowing more details about it, when he draws in his head does he see his hands holding the pen drawing on paper or is it more of like a cursor tracing lines on what he sees? does he only trace the lines of what he sees or does he imagine it from different perspectives and then compares it to reality? are there any sounds involved? etc.",6년 전,0,

Do you feel what you draw or are you relaxed and ""empty"" in your head? Do you stick to an internal image or do you change it while you draw and if so, how much and often? Do your drawings surprise you? Are you happy with them? Do you feel like a ""master"" (whatever it means to you)?.   And these questions are from the top of my head, without any long deep thoughts behind, I'll have twice as much in 5 minutes. The interviewer asked sooooo boring, uninteresting questions for the most part. I'm sorry but I don't care about his siblings and how happy they might be.

@justalostlocal,"You didn't ask me. But as an illustrator hopefully I can contribute sth. For me, first, it's when the image I created matches the pictures in my head about 90%. Because I'm not so skilled like Kim I often want to start over or return to a piece in the case of digital illustrations. Second, when adding more doesn't make the painting or drawing achieve the original purpose, I'll stop. For example when drawing background far away I won't keep adding details otherwise the sense of depth will be lost. Or when drawing a character I just  make sure the posture, colors, lines and textures harmonize and bring forward their personality and status. Ultimately 'when to stop' is an instinct. Some prefer highly detailed and some like loose styles.  What a lot of beginners don't realize is that 80% work is at the planning stage aka composting a drawing through shapes in perspective, lighting and color blocks. After that it's all rendering. If the base of such image is mediocre it's harder to stop adding later on, and even  harder to make it look good.",6년 전,4,

Also for the people who see practice as more of a chore the time they spent practising will feel longer so they will always feel like the ones who enjoy practising more have gotten skills from less work as in natural skills. people are confused with the people who have passion for art, i personally don't understand why people want to be great artists if they don't enjoy practising, if they would rather do other things then why not do them things instead.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@functio1,"I think that the approach by anyone making videos like these is wrong. I mean, calling him a 'master' is silly. It automatically sets him up against everyone else, which IMHO is the wrong attitude to have when viewing other people's creative output, and especially when presenting that output for others to see. Note that Kim Jung Gi is not churning out highly refined, highly polished images in the traditional sense - he's drawing for the sake of drawing. This is because he enjoys it but also - more importantly - he seems to not care what anyone else might think about his work before, during and probably after he's drawn something. He's doing his own thing, whereas many other people would always have a voice at the back of their mind sowing doubts. One thing that causes these doubts is to have the voice tell you that X person is a master, and therefore what you're doing is not as good in comparison, nor will it be, etc. Videos like this tend to idolise people who are only doing what they like to do, and are an artist like anyone else here who sees themselves as an artist too - or simply just likes to draw, paint, etc without attaching a label to themselves. Anyone else here could do the same thing in their own way and in their own style if they stopped worrying about what anyone else thinks. One way of killing off people's creative output is to call someone else a master - just say 'Hey, we think this artist does interesting work - let's watch them draw!' and leave it at that ;-)",6년 전,0,

You're experienced now, you're an engineer, so in your pursuit right now you'll be riding on the back of your experience and not stumble around as a naive child. But that would happen only if you actually do what you want to do and quit whining. Kinda like Kim Jung Gi. He did what he wanted to do and struggled with obstacles as a regular person until he was good enough to overcome those obstacles, so in a sense he acted like adult in school already.

@Nordic_Goon,"The question about political correctness couldn't be a more perfect question, especially since it's something that is so heavily pushed in our societies now days. Something I have noticed in my life is that art isn't politically correct. Which is ironic, because the the art scene in general has seemingly forgotten this. I may not be an art major, or even be able to consider myself an artist, but I can connect with art, I just can't connect with the art community of our present day. The entire purpose of art in my opinion is to generate a reaction or an emotion from it's audience positive.., or negative, it doesn't matter. Credibility and talent shouldn't be measured by how well an artist pleases their audience, but more about how much of a reaction in general they are able to achieve. It's a sad day for the art community who I have seen more commonly than not, supporting measures to tighten restrictions on political correctness in not only art itself, but in our daily lives as well.",6년 전,0,

You can have your opinion and I will have mine, that is fine but unless you have a body of work you have created that you can directly correlate to your opinions and then show me like I can to you I can't accept it. I have done exactly what I explained over and over in the field I work in. I have also worked with other creatives who also showcase and discuss the same topic. Talent isn't static and I am aware of how the reward system works. How is interest created by determination? A baby is interested in everything without determination.

@jackieenois,"Observation is key, as focus is key, I am not much of a drawer, but I was diagnosed with thd and there as a time I was focused in drawing, I was able to enter a kind of very strange flow that lead me to a state of hyper perception of reality, it felt like a super power after a long session 6. + Hours drawing nonstop the forms and lines and the shades suddenly appeared very clearly in front of me, I stopped to look at my window and I could really see everything, see for real the whole as and the very little nuances of shades and lines. Focus was the key . Unfortunately I didn't pursue that , I felt that I was going insane I stopped drawing I don't know, felt wrong. It was amazing, I truly believe that if did that every day since that time those amplified perceptions would evolve and maybe become permanent. And let me tell you the feeling of truly seeing is true power.",6년 전,0,

When you find a tool you're comfortable with and can manipulate it ways that replaces the need for MANY tools... You tend to prefer it.  Look at the many effects he can create with a SINGLE tool: Fine lines, heavy lines, shading, fine points, blobs, blotches.... He can do all of his processes at the same time: line art, shading, details... All without having to switch tools. That particular brand though? Usually people stick with what they KNOW is consistently reliable and are satisfied with the quality it provides in the way they use the product. ____________________________  I know your question was posted a year or more ago, but I didn't really see any response.

@ClockworkWyrm," @skat0rzZzz  Ask any professional artist how to improve and this will be their reply. Drawing every day and practice can make a HUGE difference in your work. That's not to say there isn't a biological component. I don't think everyone is wired to be a professional visual artist but I do think everyone has the capacity to create decent art with enough practice.   Also, there's no shame in using reference or creating build/guide lines. Every artist crafts differently and that's the part of the beauty of the work. We won't all be Kim Jung Gi but the good news is that we don't HAVE to be.   No need to be rude (not necessarily you Penngrove) when someone is trying to be positive and helpful.

@codyrogers6436,How to draw from imagination? #1 practice practice and practice don't worry about what it looks like. Imagination has no boundaries or rules except for what you set for yourself. #2 think of it as a movie or even TV the only difference is the pictures are in your mind and if you have to then use a reference and use that reference but don't just look at the reference study everything you can about that reference such as the small details that makes up that reference to give your work a little extra personality but don't try and draw every little minut aspect of that picture just enough to trick your eyes and your brain will fill in the rest automatically. #3 everything is comprised of shapes within a picture. Look the right way and you'll see shapes from the screen that is in front of your face to the room that you are sitting in at the time to everyday life. #3 turn off the TV and the internet turn on the radio or anything with music and practice as much or as little as you want. Like a muscle in your body it will only get bigger and stronger the more you work that muscle out. And last but not least don't be afraid to learn. Learn techniques. learn different tricks and study any and every subject possible of whatever it is you are into than put that to your Artistic Endeavors and use criticism as a learning tool  to better yourself and never give up  on yourself .😬👍,6년 전(수정됨),1,

My teacher, Ms.Davis, had us study still life, and exposed us to watercolor, crayons, colored pencils, markers. She asked to enter my still life drawing in a state art competition.

What I find WAY more impressive about this guy is the fact that hes drawing with ink and he doesnt sketch out anything before just going in. Anyone who draws with ink knows that overlapping becomes very difficult. If you plan on drawing someone reaching out in front of someones chest, you need to remember to leave that part of the chest blank to fit that arm... or draw that arm first.

@animeswitch,really? how much should you draw to stay safe?,6년 전,3,
@GiraffeCoco, @animeswitch  take regular breaks and don't hold the pen too tight or draw stiffly. You should try to draw standing as it can really affect your health and spine. I have aches in my hands and scoliosis and damaged nails that don't grow right anymore because of holding my pen too tight and I'm only young. Please don't make the same mistakes as me and take care of your body,6년 전,14,
@ysucae," @animeswitch  it should not hurt. stop when your body starts to be tired, take regular breaks, and never, ever draw if it hurts. get up and walk a bit. find out why you're hurting or tired (scoliosis, tendonitis, carpal tunnel, bad posture, etc), then correct it. if it involve changing your drawing habits (how you hold the pen, etc), be patient and do it correctly, because it may affect negatively your drawing at first and can be akward, but you get used to it pretty fast if you persist. if you have to stop drawing, STOP. learn to draw with your non dominant hand, or at least use your non dominant hand to do most chores. learn stretches and good posture. draw on inclined surfaces. I used to draw 12-14 hours straight for a day and was super high level, but then had to stop for years. now I draw 30-45 min at a time, maximum 4-5 hours a day. I'll never get back to where I was, but at least I can still draw. I know a couple of people who will never be able to draw again because of really, really bad tendonitis in the wrist, arm or even shoulder. drawing is risky because of repeated movement and strain on the body... I wish drawing was less about performance and more about the simple pleasure of it.",6년 전,9,
@alanaflynn8878,"​ @animeswitch  Seconding what Em said. I take a 2-10 minute break every 40-70 minutes. My only parameters for the breaks are I can't sit or have my arms at a 90 degree angle or less; my arms have to be at a different angle than when drawing. Usually, I walk laps around the house or stand and watch some videos then get back to drawing.",6년 전,2,

@migueldiaz3262," @seanwarren9357  Funny enough, from the experience I have going through art school. You're both right and wrong. A mistake with an ink pen is either: complete amateur mistake like bleeding the pen too much, or not waiting for the ink to settle on the bristles of your brush before setting defining or detail oriented  area; OR like in a pro's level, how to incorporate that mistake into your free flowing art style, a ""sploch"" of ink on a shirt your drawing becomes a dark transition on the shirt to represent bends, or a forceful valley that is struck by a secondary light source (flood light), maybe the a crease in a metal pin? Or blood stains on a white shirt. Etc. Yes, ink pen brush will teach you an understanding of capturing the world around you in sum the first time around, but there will be mistakes, and you should take the chance on these mistakes to explore and go wild on the paper. Understanding what you see will also accompany you with learning how the materials you are using and drawing upon, interact. Key word, understanding. It will take time, but if you have the talent, desire, and/or love for art, do it. You won't regret it, if you get good, you could even make money on the side.",6년 전,0,

Stamina, or the lack thereof, doesn't say much about his ability to draw realistically from imagination.

He has the finish-what-you start attitude because his encouragement is seeing how good it looks as it unfolds. He's also experienced in the sense that he's drawn many similar things before, which would be where more internalization of patterns comes from.

Of course he has to be professional in professional settings and calling his drawings misogynistic is more a point of view than being pc. The good thing is that he can make the erotic drawing he enjoys and publish them in a compilation, there is an audience for that, and he can also make his sfw work and also show it to the world. Its only a ""family friendly"" vs ""18+"" audience lol, its not pc.",6년 전,0,

@arianadourre," @grey-pilled5253  Yeah definitely. Just that most of the art is saturated with females in degrading positions.

@cynamonstudio,"@proko and @sinix. There is one thing that interests me about what Kim Jung Gi says. He quit the arts school to seek his own way. It happens , but I started thinking that maybe there is something lacking in so-called formal education. Drawing from imagination is just a tiny fraction of the time you that you spend while studying. I am not saying it is not valuable, quite opposite. But at some point there should be more effort put at developing visualization skills, drawing from memory because - lets be honest -  these days , the world needs only 'a few' well trained portrait makers. And this is something that is - in my humble opinion - almost completely ignored by most of the teachers. We are not encouraged to draw from memory, therefore we become skillful copyists. We are simply good at coping what we see. I sometimes think that some artists without formal education have more power and guts to discover something new. Let me know what you think. Best.",6년 전,40,

@MaryArts,"We did kinda both in art school. We had a model but since we had different techniques every time and only had like 4 minutes to draw them, we concentrate on what is most important for us to draw.

@TheFutureLooksGrimm,"It’s important to realize that college life is a whole package and the life experience, connections, friends, life lessons you take with you are worth even the insane tuition costs when considering the life experience and advantages you keep. I could make a never ending list of what one learns Vs being shelter.  It can mean the difference between walking around clueless of health conditions you may have, and having a roommate or college friend inform you that you have a serious skin condition, or some other health concerns. Their are various things people do wrong on a daily basis until they bump into finding out better ways to do something. I had to read my dishwasher manual when I got my first single bed apartment and I’m sure that their are betterways of securing shot glass and tiny bowls that stacking heaving mugs on them. In colege you meet so many people that the odds are in your favor to find projects and people to collaborate with. I’ve read tons of biographies to find out how artists become masters.  I found that many artists successfully in the same fields whether comics or music, that it was a huge advantage that they were in the same NY school where teachers helped them get connections, and even took ghem on road trips to help and watch do professional art jobs, professional studio recordings of known bands, and so on. If your parents support your dream and are willing to invest in you even just by cosigning the loans, don’t let the opportunity go by.  Give it all you got.   It’s been my dream for many years to go to full time college but could never secure all the loans. So instead I sunk thousands in new and used books, and got I’ve gone to school for automotive and it was the same thing. Not much left for actually hands on training. And you are lucky to get 1 really excellent teacher that you won’t ever forget.  But that was only a 1 year trade school. I’d love to go to a real college even part time while living in Boston. For now I’ll take classes and get the transferable credits cheaper at community college until I can figure out my best plan to try again for the 4th time.",6년 전,2,

@Captain_MonsterFart,"I lost my way somewhere. Being a grown up got in the way....throwing away my TV also (counter intuitively) made me draw far less. I used to spend hours as a couch potato watching Seinfeld or whatever while drawing non stop.  Once I got a social life and a ski pass, it all faded off. Then I went to animation school specifically for drawing lessons...but that led to a computer desk job and it was very hard to make myself sit a concentrate on drawing after sitting and concentrating for 10 hours at work. Now I'm a grown up with responsibilities and tasks to do. My skills are fading. But it's turning into excuses now.

@aircombatmaneuvers,Drawing more helps but you can play soccer 24x7 and you are not going to be as good as messi. This guy has quality and talent he has a LOT of practice he attended art school and has a visual memory developped from mind drawing. You can just sit and watch a thing and imagine you are mind drawing it that will make you see every detail then pick a paper and draw it again from memory and when you get stuck watch it again. Its a process of memory linked to drawing lines and doing a huge amount of sketches will bring that memory into mudcle memory and that other kind of memory like when you can type letters from keyboard without seeing them,6년 전,0,

@RD-lt3ht,"There's something about KJG that no one's commenting on here: he didn't FUCKING CARE as a lad, even if all other aspects of his learning abilities suffered because of his absolute devotion to drawing; I think even ""amount-of-time-spent-drawing"", which ostensibly is IDENTICAL to ""devotion"" is perhaps NOT identical. Hearing KJG talking of his lack of concern for academics makes me believe he wouldn't have been turned from his devotion even if teachers and family tried ""motivating"" him in the academic direction the old-fashioned way, namely coercive humiliation, which they probably did. I think a Jordan Peterson type would've considered school-aged KJG  a maladjusted boy, and his parents negligent. DON'T THINK TOO DAMNED MUCH ABOUT STUFF THAT DOESN'T MATTER TO YOU, YOU CAN'T BE GOOD AT EVERYTHING; especially don't listen to the ones (I wish I hadn't) who say, ""YOUR just good at useless DOODLING, I'M good at the ""three Rs"" so that means I'm gonna be somebody IMPORTANT, like a DOCTOR or LAWYER, so NNNYAAA!!!"". My point: KJG didn't care about achieving WORLDLY STATUS in the eyes of others, which left him as free to devote himself to drawing-purity as a monk to God or Buddha; however, this is a difficult state of mind to achieve in this bastard of a world, because Mammon bellows at you perpetually.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

His sedentary life style has likely led to his metabolism being considerably slower then most, so he likely eats less and uses the bathroom much less frequently then most English speakers.

@Cardinalbins,"They aspect is time.  The more talented you are and the earlier you begin, both shortens your road.  If you are untalented and you start drawing after your childhood maybe with 30. Maybe you would be a master at age 166. Unfortunately our lifespan is still too short.  This guy in the video he is talented, and he started as a young boy. He required 30 years to become a master.  But what about that average dude who wants to draw good and is already 25 and has a job. Propably not..",6년 전(수정됨),1,
@WhoIsJohnblack," @Cardinalbins  I think you misunderstand. Talent doesnt exist in my opinion. Its a cop out. I have heard many famous people say the same thing; do a thing with all your focus and time, immerse and dedicate yourself in the subject... And you will eventually become a master.  The theory of mastery is that 10,000 hours creates mastery of a subject. You can decrease that time by studying other masters, by imagining doing this action and focusing all your energy on it.  Dedication + Hardwork + Studying + Time + Many Failures = ""Talent""",6년 전,7,

@vitoscaletta3202," @TraceurArok  ​I agree with @TheAstrius here. Anyone who thinks they can achieve same mastery just like that is living in a deluded bubble world. Effort and training does play a part yes, but did you know something called genetics exist? This world isn't fair. Some people are born disabled, some people are born already doing algebra as a baby. No one is born the same and some are just born inferior to others.  Maybe study something about evolution. Genetics determines most of who you are, and how naturally you can be. Imagine if you're born without a leg. Sure you can compensate by working hard to master walking with one leg, but you will still never be as good as someone who can walk with two legs. Imagine if you're born shorter than others. You wanna play basketball competitively but you're worse off. What the hell can you do about it? TOO BAD.  The same goes here. Take it from an artist like me. I hardly draw at all ,yet 5 years later I go back and I can still draw an entire character. Coming from someone like you. with no proof, who doesn't draw... here's MY proof to you. It's called INNATE TALENT. For artists, most artists have this skill of being able to visualise things from the back of their mind and immediately translate it to paper. Others can't do it so they need more practice and lots of reference to draw from. Many other ordinary people can't even visualise the simple stuff so even if they draw from reference, they end up with stick figures.  Again, my point is you CAN get better by practice obviously, but some people don't need as much 'practice' to get to the same point you achieved by simply putting in 100x less effort. Too bad, the world isn't fair.",6년 전(수정됨),12,

@TheFutureLooksGrimm,"Shaun M People are using my fav comic artist the highly ambitious acomplished ToddMcFarlane,  as an example to backup their theory that many artists try but never become as skilled as Kim.  Todd could have gotten to that level if that was his only focus early on.   That theory depends on a faulty comparison. Kim draws with obsession, EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME!  He has to draw!  Where as so many comic artists, especially “good girl art” artists eventually stick to drawing the same type of stuff constantly.   I am a big fan of Kim, but people need to realize they aren’t going to be told exactly how his mastery was achieved.  It’s not all fun and excitement.  I doubt he is going to start divulging how for example it took obsession, ignoring/neglecting your family at the time, and making your entire life’s focus on yourself and drawing. Robert Crumb was obsessed with drawing as a kid and if he didn’t draw, his brother would give me Hell to pay. Going without drawing for a day makes him sick and depressed. But many old school artists won’t even admit getting frustrated! I literally stood up amazed when I found Crumb’s drawings of himself frustratedly tearing paper or stomping on disguarded sketches!  That was an extremely admission from an artist in general, but not from a candid artist like Crumb.  My obsession was to find an answer to how people learn to draw and master it. For the first time in my life over 10 years ago I learned to draw well!  With eyes open I learned that the sky is the limit and self-help books and psychology helped me understand why people around me, especially parrents, will doom their kids with disolution and negative critism.  Artists of the old school seem to feed these magical illusions and secrecy of skillbuilding. Where as newer artists tire of their hard work and sacrifice being overlooked.   My guitar heroes fed the false stories around how one becomes a master.  When the interviewers and cameraa are in your face, people have expectations of answers and magic. Even today some master musicians continue to brag on camera that they never took a lesson in their lives, or that they have never been able to read music notes!  I quit a year of lessons at 16yrs old upon hearing that. It was a mistake.   I believe their’s is big problem in the US where instead of admitting not knowing an answer to a question, we rather assume the answer.  I was like that half of my life and it’s a lack of quality education and likewise guardians that led be to be that way. Their’s a huge problem in the US with the need for immediate instant self-gratification and those who assume they know better, forcing their dooming advice on others.  Only until recently with the internet have artists of all types began to divulge the learning process. When I was younger, even my favorite guitar legends would play down the truth of what they knew by stating that they never took a lesson in their life and can’t read a note. Little did I know that this was partly inspired by reality tv, having a camera equipped interviewer in your face, forcing feelings of expectations. Even still, it bothers me that I allowed it to influence me and quit my lessons. Even today some artists continue to lie on camera. Nevermind that some had virtuoso pianists for parrents.",6년 전,4,

@TheFutureLooksGrimm,"pastadecoca that’s what it takes to be a master like Kim Jung Gi, it requires obsession.  Not just in this skill, but others as well. Master magicians will sit or stand in front of a mirror practicing performing the same slight-of-hand illusion for hours a day, sometimes they will practice palming a coin, shifting hands, making a coin disappear, doing it 1,000 times!  For whatever reason, old school artists, be they visual artists, guitar legends, or legendary illusionists, they will not reveal in depth how hard they worked, and the frustrations they endured. When I was a kid learning guitar, I unfortunately believed my guitar heroes bragging about never taking a lesson in their lives, not knowing how to read a single note, and they certainly didn’t mention that their parents were working musicians piano virtuosos. And when it was revealed that some took business classes to aid them in the music business, they denied it.   And that is just a part of the reason why it’s such a secret. Sometimes when something seems so unbelievable due to lacking the knowledge in that area, people resort to assuming an explanation such as being born with a drawing skill. Or illusionists having real magical powers. Something I believed as a kid. After I found how they were performed, I was amazed at how simple the trick really was, and that fooling the audience was largely due a skilled choreographed acting performance.   As for those who compared pro comic artists to Kim in order to prove that mastery depends on a born-with talent, I call false equivalency.  Most artists more or less draw the same subjects every day, only slightly deviating. Some of my fav copic marker artists draw nothing but girls and furry animals daily selling commissions.

Every person who truly wants to get really good will very naturally draw a lot, sometimes without even the slightest effort. So it should not be formulated like this. The true difficulty is to not let yourself be discouraged by a progression that does not immediately satisfies you.

@TheFutureLooksGrimm,"Ejio Aethius the moral of the story is, if you are a master artist working on your brand, part of the work is in putting out a certain persona and doing some acting.   If you want to become a master like Kim, develop an obsession for drawing everything and work at all costs to reach master level.  If you have kids, you can start working toward your mastery by living in your studio room and only allowing your family to see the pencil and back of your head.   Maybe try the rubber band pain trick sometimes recommended to stop nail biting.   Wear your wrist snapping rubber band. Every time you get distracted or find yourself having stopped drawing, snap the rubber band!  Convince yourself that not drawing is very painful!

@StormEngineer,"Talent does exist. When a kid in kindergarten draws in 3D perspective without ever having been taught how to do that, it is talent. And I've did that too BTW, so I know first hand what I'm talking about. Yes, people confuse learned skill with talent. Yes, it sucks when you work hard and people call you ""talented"" as a result (though often they actually mean ""skill"", they just use the wrong term). But talent still does exist. The important thing about it is however, that talent alone will not make you a great or successful artist. You still have to work hard, talent only gives you a starting advantage.  I like to say that talent is like being tall in basketball: It won't automatically make you a great player, and you doN't need to be tall to be a great player either, but it certainly does help if you are. Talent is the same, it does help but neither is required nor dues it guarantee success.",6년 전,66,

@knotwilg," @jasonwhyttes1679  If you like drawing, then draw. However, if you expect to make a living out of it, then you'd better be very good. And in order to be very good, you need both dedication and talent. Often dedication comes from motivation and motivation comes from positive feedback and postitive feedback comes from the fact that you reach a result higher than average with putting in similar effort. In short talent.  It's not impossible to become a master at something which your not talented for, but it's rare. I'm a mathematician. I wouldn't encourage someone intrinsically bad at math, because they're bad at abstraction, to become a professional mathematician, even if they're somehow motivated to become one.

@Sancosity," @StormEngineer  I don't know, I was also one of those ""talented"" kids, but I still say talent doesn't exist. The reason I think it's not talent is because I was simply interested in drawing at an early age. Something about it was mesmerising to me, so I would draw a lot and notice things that other people wouldn't, simply because I was so into it. I could also draw in 3d perspective when I was very young, but only because that's how I viewed my subjects, I loved to draw so would pay great attention to these things which other kids wouldn't.

@dynomax101," @jasonwhyttes1679   Talent can be gained. Ignoring talent is like ignoring a bear biting your head off. Talent does not guarantee success, nor does talent guarantee any particular person will work hard. There are untalented people. No use denying it. There are talented people. Also no use denying it.   There has to be a realization that one can learn.  There also should be a realization that the field of art is vast, with a rich, ancient to modern history.   Can anyone gain something suddenly that never appeared even over years and years of fruitless practice-practice-practice? Yes. Can I prove that assertion? Only with my own experiences as examples, which will mean nothing to anyone else.   I see a lot of comments on art uploads that show me opinions by very inexperienced people; often those who have read books on theory and have scarcely ever put pencil on paper or paint on canvas or chisel to stone or modeled clay or made 3D digital builds from scratch or whatever.   A lot of click bait vis-a-vis art ""tutorials"" on Youtube or whatever. Kim Jung Gi is marvelous at what he does. Way better than I can be...at what he does. But I don't do what he does, nor does he do what I do.

@Seamo57,"Well, to answer question as simply as possible, it's like ""muscle memory.""  There are people like the ""Human Calculator"" - who when tested, actually uses a different part of his brain, than mathematicians do (for the most part..... obviously there are exceptions)... they use parts that are more related to ""reflex actions"" & ""Muscle Memory"" ... Plus Kim Jung Gi has been drawing EVERYTHING for a long time... So yes, as amazing as it is... especially being an Artist myself, as well as a scientist, I'm still BLOWN AWAY by his ability to do no underdrawing/sketch. However, there are many things I do this way... Although I'd definitely not put myself anywhere near his caliber. MANY, MANY YEARS OF PRACTICE, REPETITION, MAKE YOU MORE FORMIDABLE... Well ANYTHING.

The easiest way to deal with writer's block is to find inspiration from other artists, and to totally ignore others' art like video games and anime is counter productive. Sure, obsessing over video games and anime is a bit much, but having everything in moderation, creates a backdrop in the brain for ideas and in some ways it's your prompt.

@JSheetzArtwork,Part where he says he remembers images for a long time. Thats the problem ive always had. I can study an object over and over for many hours before drawing or i can also look at an object to draw and the image dissapears from my memory within less than a second.    For example i can do a study drawing a face and after many hours of studying i can name the different bones and point out the different angles or shapes but the memory of the image in my head is gone and so does the information and details about the parts. Other than drawing everyday (been drawing for 23 years daily) what can i do to fix this?,6년 전,1,

@Cernunnnos, @JSheetzArtwork  I understand. I've got it too.  My memory seems to work by sound and motion. I paint by imagining the motion of an idea or scene and trying to capture that.

I just said it wont bring you the skills you see here. He has a special gift. No different in my mind than a high I.Q. You cannot study to raise your I.Q. You can study to learn more facts and how to apply those facts, but the I.Q. is inherent in the person. i.e. your born with it. Watch his videos, enjoy his abilities but dont kid yourself.  Your not going to do what he does with just practice. You need his special abilities WITH practice.",6년 전,0,

Studying a room full of people and things for an hour and then drawing it a day or two later once a week is one thing which I find doable. But doing it constantly would exhaust my brain. It's like closing his eyes and taking a deep breath is for him the mental refreshment equivalent of several good nights of sleep for me. The other thing is how stuff he's studied never seems to fade away. I find it hard to remember things I've studied months ago and moved on.

In the way I've heard it used, it's a reminder that you should be grateful to God for your talents and should not have pride in your accomplishments.  A very Christian sentiment.  BS.

Berserk by Kentaro Miura anyone? that poor girl casca gets run through the mill. But it was encapsulated into the plot and the character's motivations. Thematically and setting wise--it is poignant and meant to be uncomfortable and sad not titillating. sexually exploitative material is here in the US with game of thrones, video games, our music even. It's about CONTEXT: it is there for storytelling contexts that require the emotional trauma. Berserk shows the consequences to the victim, the perpetrators--all who are involved. It tells us about the world that lead to this.   We internalize our immoral behavior and do not act on it, it is expressed through scrutinizing or stulimulating means ( whether to arouse or make people uncomfortable or shocked) ethical implications of the depictions, can be executed correctly or incorrectly. The work shows the viewer what it can tell us about a patriarchal society with a demonstrably pervasive “rape culture.”",6년 전(수정됨),2,

@RandomIsMyLif3," @Yue4me  what media meets your approval? I think its important to be exposed to healthy examples of behavior in media just as much as the immoral and debauched--its apart of our history and I can't pretend i live in a utopia. people that enjoy berserk, even though they know of its use of horrible crime and  injustice exposure ( I'm sure there are some psycho's that enjoy the exploitation of women/prostitution/rape/gore/war/pedophilia and don't see past that point. ) see these scenes and are unhappy or uncomfortable because we know it's wrong and we want to see the characters improve and get through it: it is set in a world of trauma.   storytelling and most fiction have conflict such as these. arcs can't move foreward without that fall. I refer more closely to the amazing ink detail that the mangaka has and to erase his work because of its content seems a shame. that being said do I agree with direction that his work goes into? not always, but I am not going to put my foot in his path and stop him from drawing his PICTURES. people that can't separate fantasy/ drawings from real life and commit real time crime shouldn't use art or stories they see or hear as a scapegoat to their inability to hold themselves accountable and control their violent urges and cruelty towards their fellow human.  :)  I can say i like the manga: how it shows the deconstruction of a masculine man with a traumatice past, causing developement of coping traits that hinder his adult life, the struggle with emotional and physical closeness. And the griffiths acts are justified from a story perspective and has a huge dramatic impact.The Intention was not to eroticize rape, it might come across as done distastefully/titillation-- but I see it as emphasis to the theme of the dealings of shame and humiliation in the violation of someones self-worth/personhood: the emotional experience. Berserk is in no way perfect... hope we see a better treatment of Casca's character, her reverting to a childlike stage has left out the proper respect as a character or as a victim. It appears as cognitive dissonance in the way the rapes are expressed and irreverence to serious tragic moments  I understand though that people experience and read things differently, and I respect that you may take issues with scenes that I do not. I think it is still perfectly reasonable to criticize how some of his rape portrayals turn out--I just don't think he intends to eroticize rape.",6년 전(수정됨),1,

There are many varieties that effect the function of a brush, from flow, to elasticity, to stiffness... Its easy to get confused when you have little experience.

@Seamo57," @emranshaqif1908  Those are great, but they're shorter, I use those every day, I'm guessing he uses many, but the longer ones are possibly Kuretake of some kind.
