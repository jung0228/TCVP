@StevenC32,"LeBron elevated 11.5 feet to block that shot, his head was nearly at the rim.  This is the moment when LeBron passed Jordan in my eyes.  Being down 3 games to 1 and the determination that it took to come back, having back to back 40 point games and then in game 7 getting a triple double to go along with 3 blocked shots, one of which was of the super human variety.  This was not just any team to come from behind on, this was a record 73 game winning team.  Coming back from 3 games to 1 against 73 win defending champion team is like playing 3 straight championship games, because they faced elimination in 3 straight games.  That is the heart of a champion, most teams would have given up being down 3 games to 1.",13일 전,2,

Had he missed both free throws, putting Cleveland in a discomforting position, Curry could’ve come down and hit a three, tying the game and going into overtime, and the Warriors probably would’ve walked away from that finals with the win, but Bron knocked down one, giving Cleveland a 4-point lead with like 10 seconds left in the game.

@FJHYFHFYJUGJYG,我与一百多岁的岳母得法记 我从小就体弱多病，又经过几次大的磨难。出生十二天，我不吃不喝，用偏方才救活过来。小的时候从近三米高的地方头朝下摔下来了。十二岁我做了大手术，留下后遗症。我身体一直不好，可我总想有个好身体。 在中共的党文化的所谓教育下，我不相信有神佛存在，认为人死了就什么都不知道了，没有什么来世。人活着没有奔头，没有意义。可我从小爱听神仙故事，受过传统文化的教育。老辈人说：人要善良，做个好人。  也许自己本性没有完全埋没，有那么一点善根，在二零零六年有缘走進了大法修炼。  那时我照顾生病的妻子，家中又有老人和孙女需要照顾，看书学法少，炼功也不能炼全了，不知道修炼的内涵，不知怎么去修，心性提高的慢。尽管这样，师父给我净化了身体，大手术后遗症、眩晕、腰椎间盘突出、颈椎病和一些小毛病都好了。  在修炼中我的悟性不高，从一个满身业力和一个满脑子肮脏思想的常人，要想达到一个修炼人的标准，得加倍付出。拿炼功打坐来说吧，我以前从没盘过腿，开始时散盘都盘不了，腿疼的很厉害。慢慢可以单盘，腿还翘得很高。经过很长时间腿能双盘了，一扳上去疼得不行，腿、腰、头都一起疼，由开始一分钟，几分钟，突破半个小时，还是达不到炼功一个小时的标准。和同修交流自己的业力就得自己消，不承受怎么能行呢？忍着疼痛坚持着。我在常人中还是能吃苦的，可常人中的苦和修炼中的苦是不一样的。修炼人要把吃苦当成乐，吃苦才能消罪业，才能使自己得到提升。  二零一五年由于“诉江”，社区和派出所都找过我，小区物业也找到我，让我不要给他们找“麻烦”。我认为大法和修大法的学员是最正的，必须让物业和业主知道真相。我就主动和他们讲真相，大多数都做了“三退”（退出中共的党、团、队组织）。在疫情期间，明真相的门卫主动给来我家的同修开门。学法中我认识到做事不是修炼，在做事中的心态、心性符合法了才能做好资料，才能达到让人明白真相，达到救人的目的。  再说说我的岳母，她今年已一百零一周岁了，思维敏捷，生活自理。她这一代人饱经风霜，一生吃了不少苦，中华民族的优良传统在她身上体现出来了。她吃苦耐劳，不贪图享乐，珍惜世间的事物，善待他人。她和儿孙交谈中经常用自己的经历教导儿孙，她说：做人要善良，不要贪图享乐，做人要积极向上，想得到就得通过劳动，做人要真诚，做一个对得起自己良心的人。她没有文化，话很朴实。在我修大法后给我提供了提高心性的机会，是我的一面镜子。我们共同生活了四十多年，说话就随便，有时她说的话不符合我的观念时，我张口就来反驳她，有时怼她，过后我也知道不符合炼功人的标准，没有善心。我认识到善心是多年修炼基础才能自然出来的，不是强为想做到就能做到的。  岳母和大法结缘是在二零一一年，她突然摔了一跤，经医院检查是股骨头骨折，那时她已近九十高龄。由于摔的部位皮肤破了，不能手术，但很危险，下不来床，万一感染，心肺衰竭，人就不行了，好多老人都是这样走的。那时她还没有接触大法。我跟她讲：只有法轮大法能救你，听大法师父讲法吧！她说：行！回家后，我给她放师父讲法录像。她每天都在看、听师父讲法，就这样师父管她了。她慢慢的能下地了，用助行器行走，逐渐生活可以自理了。我们全家人都见证了大法的神奇。  我岳母没有文化，我们读书学法时她就听。现在她还跟着我们一起发正念。十多年了，师父一直看护着她，保护着她。这十多年中，她摔了五、六次跤，每一次都有惊无险。特别是去年三月二十二日早上，我正在炼功，她去了卫生间，就听“咣当”很大的一声，我跑过去发现她头撞在墙上了，倒在地上。我把她扶起来，回到床上，打开师父的讲法录音给她听。她十几天听师父讲法，就好了，不疼了。那么大岁数，真是太神奇了。  还有在二零二一年晚上，她两次血压升至二百多，又拉又吐。我儿子说：送医院吧！我说：又是晚上，一百多岁的人经不起折腾。我没害怕，还是让她听师父讲法，给她发正念，第二天就好了。经过这些事情，她更相信师父，相信大法。有亲朋好友看她，她还把大法护身符送给人家。  能幸福的生活在法轮大法的护佑中，这都是大法师父赐予她的福寿康宁。有邻居和认识的人问我：老太太怎么活那么大岁数的？我说：因为她相信大法，做一个善良人，才会有这样的福报。她的存在也是大法的真相。  (c) 1999-2025 明慧网版权所有,4개월 전,0,

Kyrie Irving hit the game winning shot. It put the Cavs up by 3. When James went to the line, the Cavs were up by the 3 points that Irving made. And James missed one of the 2 free throws proving skips point that LeBron is not a great free throw shooter. I guess now we are rewriting the rules of game winning shots to be who ever made the last point in a game, is the person who won the game? Unbelievable!

However, both fanbases had massive knots in their stomach, as we watched shot after shot missed by both sides.   Even after we were up by FOUR, I still wasn’t happy till it ran triple-Zs because Curry is so deadly from deep and I just knew that one of the Cavs was going to foul him as he threw up a triple-prayer.   I can honestly say, that if a Championship ever comes back to The Land, it would be incredibly hard to top how I felt about this one. Being down 3-1, against the regular-season-record-breaking, reigning champs - this Finals meant the world to me….   I remember watching the Cavs - 9 years prior in disbelief, as a 14-year-old, getting swept by the Spurs in the finals and sticking with this team no matter who came and who left.

@SPLASHEDITS-SUB,"Boy oh boy where do I even begin. LeBron... Happy 40th Birthday. Honey, my pookie bear, I have loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you. The way you drive into the paint and strike fear into your enemies eyes. Your silky smooth touch around the rim, and that gorgeous jumpshot. I would do anything for you. I wish it were possible to freeze time so l would never have to watch you retire. You had a rough childhood, but you never gave up hope. You are even amazing off the court, you're a great husband and father, sometimes | even call you dad. I forever dread and weep, thinking of the day you will one day retire. I would sacrifice my own life it were the only thing that could put a smile on your beautiful face. You have given me so much joy, and heartbreak over the years. I remember when you first left Cleveland and it's like my heart got broken into a million pieces. But a tear still fell from my right eye when I watched you win your first ring in miami, because deep down, my glorious king deserved it. I just wanted you to return home. Then allas, you did, my sweet baby boy came home, and I rejoiced. 2015 was a hard year for us, baby, but in 2016, you made history happen. You came back from 3-1, and I couldn't believe it. I was crying, bawling even, and I heard my glorious king exclaim these words, ""CLEVELAND, THIS IS FOR YOU!"" Not only have you changed the game of basketball and the world forever, but you've eternally changed my world. And now you're getting older, but still the goat, my goat. I love you pookie bear, my glorious king, LeBron James.❤️🐐",8개월 전,4,

@RichardVagner, @roytorr4303 ​​⁠the warriors would foul the Cavs down 1 and after FTs they would be down 3 (a one possession game). Warriors had a timeout to advance the ball and would have had 3-5 seconds to get a shot off which is plenty of time to tie especially with curry,7개월 전,2,

Jordan played against at least 10 Hall of famers during his 6 years in the finals(finals only). The most being on the aging lakers (Mj's 1st title). But the fact Lebron and the Cavs were down 3-1, playing against the greatest team in modern history winning 73 games that season, and against a prime Curry, Thompson, Green, and the great role players for golden state, this was Lebrons greatest test, greatest comeback, and one NBA finals series  that was much tougher than any one of MJ's finals series(considering the talent of GS). I have to give credit when credit is due. The fact that Lebron did it with Cleveland instead of stacking up like he did with the heat makes it all that much more special and impressive.  That block was pure determination and Jordan-esque. He earned my respect 1,000% with this one. This finals, he was the 👑. 👏 Bravo 👏",9개월 전(수정됨),1,

@EddieG-x2g,"Before 2016 the Cleveland cavaliers never won a championship in their entire history. And I think in my opinion, Kevin Durant wasn't even on the warriors and the warriors won a championship without him. The year before did the Cavs won. I think that the Cavs won a championship but in my opinion it was a fluke. Because after their championship they've never won again. The warriors are 4 and 1 against the Cavs. In the Cavs are 1 and 4 against the warriors not the best record. LeBron James got so fed up with losing he went to Los Angeles. In 2022 I believe the warriors won a championship and that was impressive with the guys they had. I was just amazed at the Cavs only won one championship. The warriors though they were up 3-1 in the series. Draymond Green got suspended I don't know what game that had a lot to do with the warriors losing the whole series. but like I said the Cavs never beat the warriors after that in my heart I believe it was a fluke.",10개월 전(수정됨),0,

STARTING AT 5:18   K LOVES DEFENSE ON STEPH IS SOME OF THE BEST YOU WILL EVER SEE. Truly an unsung hero in a widely unacknowledged moment.  Just think how many times we've seen defenders try and lock Curry Down and they end up getting embarrassed... Rudy Gobert ....

The way you drive into the paint and strike fear into your enemies eyes. Your silky smooth touch around the rim, and that gorgeous jumpshot. I would do anything for you. I wish it were possible to freeze time so I would never have to watch you retire. You had a rough childhood, but you never gave up hope. You are even amazing off the court, you're a great husband and father, sometimes I even call you dad. I forever dread and weep, thinking of the day you will one day retire. I would sacrifice my own life it were the only thing that could put a smile on your beautiful face. You have given me so much joy, and heartbreak over the years. I remember when you first left Cleveland and it's like my heart got broken into a million pieces. But a tear still fell from my right eye when I watched you win your first ring in miami, because deep down, my glorious king deserved it. I just wanted you to return home. Then allas, you did, my sweet baby boy came home, and I rejoiced. 2015 was a hard year for us, baby, but in 2016, you made history happen. You came back from 3-1, and I couldn't believe it. I was crying, bawling even, and I heard my glorious king exclaim these words, ""CLEVELAND, THIS IS FOR YOU!"" Not only have you changed the game of basketball and the world forever, but you've eternally changed my world. And now you're getting older, but still the goat, my goat. I love you pookie bear, my glorious king, LeBron James. ☺️❤️🫶🏽",1년 전,1,

The league wanted to extend the series and didn't want it to end so fast. It is pretty obvious that the series would end in 5 in oracle because the momentum is completely on Warriors after 3-1 lead. Imagine draymond didn't get suspended, lol. The cavs still need Lebron and Kyrie scored, combined 82 points to win. I also want to mention that suspended of Dramymond is definitely bs. It is laughful because the technical foul was added after the game. What a shame for the cavs. Lebron needed the help from the league to win a ring. If he lost 2016 finals, he might leave the cavs and Curry would be the face of the nba for the next few years. That suspension wholly saved Lebron.",1년 전,2,

@haydenperry1859,"In a city where hope seemed as dim as the fog, Lay a yearning for glory, through an underdog. Cleveland, a heart, beaten yet bold, Dreamt of a story, waiting to be told.  In two thousand sixteen, the stage was set, A battle of titans, in sweat and net. The Warriors, mighty, with records shattered, But in Cleveland's eyes, only one thing mattered.  LeBron, a son of Akron, returned with a vow, To lift his city from despair to the now. With Kyrie, Love, and warriors of their own, They fought for every inch, muscle, and bone.  Down three to one, the world said, ""It's done."" But Cleveland's heart beat differently, longing for that run. Game after game, they clawed back into the fight, A city's dream inching closer, into the light.  Then came Game Seven, a night etched in lore, A seesaw of emotions, the score tied once more. Kyrie's three-pointer, a dagger so deep, Turned dreams into reality, as grown men weep.  LeBron's block, a moment frozen in time, A symbol of hope, of that uphill climb. And when the buzzer echoed, the deed finally done, A city erupted, the impossible won.  The curse was lifted, fifty-two years in the making, Streets filled with joy, the ground beneath shaking. For Cleveland, this victory meant more than a game, A beacon of resilience, forever to proclaim.  In the heart of Ohio, a fire was lit, A testament to never giving up, never to quit. The 2016 NBA Championship, a tale of fate, For Cleveland, a reminder, that greatness can wait.",1년 전,2,

@Dognutt69,"God still to this day I can’t believe the Cavs won. I was born and raised in Cleveland Ohio and rooted for the Cavs before these finals and I root for them still till this day. This is one of those games that you remember exactly where you were at, I was at my grandmas house and my eyes were glued to the tv while I sat in front of it on the floor . I remember being so nervous and scared that the Cavs were going to lose again because when they lost in 2015 I was devastated so I knew this year we had to win. I and everyone else watching witnessed history live, but as someone who actually is from Cleveland and suffered the lost throughout the years, seeing them finally win our first championship in any sport since 1964 was amazing. I remember the block, the shot, Kevin Loves defense on Curry, LeBron’s free throw and the sound of the buzzer going off better than the back of my hand. When LeBron had that iconic block on Iguodala I screamed of joy and when Kyrie hit that game winning 3 I started to celebrate but I was still terrified, until we were up by 4 points with 10.6 seconds left of the game. The Warriors had the ball with 10.6 seconds left of the the game and Cleveland was up by 4 it was at that moment I knew the Cavs won their first ever NBA championship. The Cavs were the underdogs and they were going against a 73-9 team, no one though they could’ve came back from a 3-1 lead but as a Cavs fan I knew that the could do it and I believed in them. This game was more than just basketball. This game was history, the first team in NBA history to comeback from a 3-1 lead in the finals, the Cavs first ever NBA championship, Cleveland’s first championship in 52 years and it was the best night of my life. I remember when the clock ran out and the buzzer went off I started to celebrate and jump around, I poured water and beer on me just because how happy I was and I didn’t know what to do. I remember the day after I had to check my phone and see if the Cavs actually won and I was so happy that it wasn’t a dream. To me as a Cavs fan this made LeBron the Goat, he did something no one else ever did. He came back after 4 years and told Ohio that he was going to give us a championship and he sure did. This game made me respect LeBron as a player and person forever and he will always be the GOAT in my eyes. When LeBron left Cleveland in 2018 I wasn’t mad because he gave us a championship like he said he was going to do. In fact when LeBron left I was a big LeBron fan by then and I told my self wherever LeBron goes I go and rooted for him ever since despite he’s not on Cleveland anymore. When Kyrie left Cleveland in 2017 I wasn’t mad because I was great full for what he did for the Cavs and the city and state of Cleveland, Ohio. I also have too much respect for Kyrie and I root for him and his team to this day. Kevin Love is amazing and I will always support him as well. Also I have to thank the Warriors for choking and blowing a 3-1 lead, seriously I really appreciate that. And in wise words of LeBron James “CLEVELAND THIS IS FOR YOU!”",2년 전,13,

But this is why I'm just a spectator, because watching Bron and Kyrie fight their way back from a 3-1 hole against arguably one of the greatest regular season teams ever was such a sight to behold.",2년 전(수정됨),0,
@megahoodfigga,All these 15 second ads bruh come on ruining a historic videi,2년 전,3,
@dognutts,"God still to this day I can’t believe the Cavs won. I was born and raised in Cleveland Ohio and rooted for the Cavs before these finals and I root for them still till this day. This is one of those games that you remember exactly where you were at, I was at my grandmas house and my eyes were glued to the tv while I sat in front of it on the floor . I remember being so nervous and scared that the Cavs were going to lose again because when they lost in 2015 I was devastated so I knew this year we had to win. I and everyone else watching witnessed history live, but as someone who actually is from Cleveland and suffered the lost throughout the years, seeing them finally win our first championship in any sport since 1964 was amazing. I remember the block, the shot, Kevin Loves defense on Curry, LeBron’s free throw and the sound of the buzzer going off better than the back of my hand. When LeBron had that iconic block on Iguodala I screamed of joy and when Kyrie hit that game winning 3 I started to celebrate but I was still terrified, until we were up by 4 points with 10.6 seconds left of the game. The Warriors had the ball with 10.6 seconds left of the the game and Cleveland was up by 4 it was at that moment I knew the Cavs won their first ever NBA championship. The Cavs were the underdogs and they were going against a 73-9 team, no one though they could’ve came back from a 3-1 lead but as a Cavs fan I knew that the could do it and I believed in them. This game was more than just basketball. This game was history, the first team in NBA history to comeback from a 3-1 lead in the finals, the Cavs first ever NBA championship, Cleveland’s first championship in 52 years and it was the best night of my life. I remember when the clock ran out and the buzzer went off I started to celebrate and jump around, I poured water and beer on me just because how happy I was and I didn’t know what to do. I remember the day after I had to check my phone and see if the Cavs actually won and I was so happy that it wasn’t a dream. To me as a Cavs fan this made LeBron the Goat, he did something no one else ever did. He came back after 4 years and told Ohio that he was going to give us a championship and he sure did. This game made me respect LeBron as a player and person forever and he will always be the GOAT in my eyes. When LeBron left Cleveland in 2018 I wasn’t mad because he gave us a championship like he said he was going to do. In fact when LeBron left I was a big LeBron fan by then and I told my self wherever LeBron goes I go and rooted for him ever since despite he’s not on Cleveland anymore. When Kyrie left Cleveland in 2017 I wasn’t mad because I was great full for what he did for the Cavs and the city and state of Cleveland, Ohio. I also have too much respect for Kyrie and I root for him and his team to this day. Kevin Love is amazing and I will always support him as well. Also I have to thank the Warriors for choking and blowing a 3-1 lead, seriously I really appreciate that. And in wise words of LeBron James “CLEVELAND THIS IS FOR YOU!”",2년 전,3,

@BSmittty6,Literally came here after that,2년 전,1,
@Someone-hi1nt,"do you know what ""goat"" stands for? greatest of all time... its not greatest of this generation, people will always compare with past legends, especially if theres someone that went 6-0 in the finals, won 5 mvps, a dpoy, made 9 all defensive first teams, had the best overall advanced stats in nba history, and impacted the game on a global level far more than anyone else has",2년 전,1,
@Zion122," @Someone-hi1nt  The point he's making is that basketball, like other sports, evolves. The game changes, the players become better in both skill and athleticism, and the talent pool gets richer as the game becomes more accessible. As accomplished as the players of yesteryear were, they would not have had the careers they did if they played today. Therefore, there's no point in comparing the greatest players of the past to the greatest players of the present, i.e., LeBron James.",2년 전(수정됨),0,
@Someone-hi1nt," @Zion122  and the point im making is no matter how good you are, there will always be comparisons made between legends of different eras... ""goat"" stands for ""greatest"" of all time... being great doesnt just mean being the most talented, it also means who was able to accomplish the most, who was able to dominate their era the most, and who had the most impact on their sport",2년 전(수정됨),0,
@Zion122," @Someone-hi1nt  Who you believe is the GOAT is a matter of opinion, so there are no set criteria for it. For example, many people, including me, would beg to differ that impact is a GOAT criterion. I also don't evaluate individual players based on team accomplishments. My definition of greatness is how good a person is at doing something (by the way, talent factors into this definition in the context of basketball because basketball is a sport, so athleticism and other physical gifts are directly correlated with success). Fields of endeavor not only evolve, but people become better at doing things over time, making it intrinsically more competitive and difficult to be successful. For example, in 2021, Michael Jordan said that he would not have had the career he had if he had played in the modern era (2001-present). The better you are at something, the greater you are at it, and the players of today are greater than the players of yesterday, so it's not fair to compare the players of yesterday to the players of today.",2년 전(수정됨),1,

In 1998 Jordan missed a shot went down the court stole the ball from Karl Malone went back down the court not down the game-winning shot where he held his pose.

The 2nd greatest player on the planet at the time, to beat the Cavs 2 more times. LeBron James would have at least 5 championships if the Warriors didn't cry on Kevin Durants' doorstep after this game 7. LeBron James is the greatest player I've ever seen. Highly doubt we'll ever see another guy that's 6'8 260, can outrun anyone, can out jump anyone, and dribble and pass like a point guard.

@dognutts,"God still to this day I can’t believe the Cavs won. I was born and raised in Cleveland Ohio and rooted for the Cavs before these finals and I root for them still till this day. This is one of those games that you remember exactly where you were at, I was at my grandmas house and my eyes were glued to the tv while I sat in front of it on the floor . I remember being so nervous and scared that the Cavs were going to lose again because when they lost in 2015 I was devastated so I knew this year we had to win. I and everyone else watching witnessed history live, but as someone who actually is from Cleveland and suffered the lost throughout the years, seeing them finally win our first championship in any sport since 1964 was amazing. I remember the block, the shot, Kevin Loves defense on Curry, LeBron’s free throw and the sound of the buzzer going off better than the back of my hand. When LeBron had that iconic block on Iguodala I screamed of joy and when Kyrie hit that game winning 3 I started to celebrate but I was still terrified, until we were up by 4 points with 10.6 seconds left of the game. The Warriors had the ball with 10.6 seconds left of the the game and Cleveland was up by 4 it was at that moment I knew the Cavs won their first ever NBA championship. The Cavs were the underdogs and they were going against a 73-9 team, no one though they could’ve came back from a 3-1 lead but as a Cavs fan I knew that the could do it and I believed in them. This game was more than just basketball. This game was history, the first team in NBA history to comeback from a 3-1 lead in the finals, the Cavs first ever NBA championship, Cleveland’s first championship in 52 years and it was the best night of my life. I remember when the clock ran out and the buzzer went off I started to celebrate and jump around, I poured water and beer on me just because how happy I was and I didn’t know what to do. I remember the day after I had to check my phone and see if the Cavs actually won and I was so happy that it wasn’t a dream. To me as a Cavs fan this made LeBron the Goat, he did something no one else ever did. He came back after 4 years and told Ohio that he was going to give us a championship and he sure did. This game made me respect LeBron as a player and person forever and he will always be the GOAT in my eyes. When LeBron left Cleveland in 2018 I wasn’t mad because he gave us a championship like he said he was going to do. In fact when LeBron left I was a big LeBron fan by then and I told my self wherever LeBron goes I go and rooted for him ever since despite he’s not on Cleveland anymore. When Kyrie left Cleveland in 2017 I wasn’t mad because I was great full for what he did for the Cavs and the city and state of Cleveland, Ohio. I also have too much respect for Kyrie and I root for him and his team to this day. Kevin Love is amazing and I will always support him as well. Also I have to thank the Warriors for choking and blowing a 3-1 lead, seriously I really appreciate that. And in wise words of LeBron James “CLEVELAND THIS IS FOR YOU!”",2년 전,12,

@Daniel-ii6rq,Kevin love locked up Curry he’s so underrated,2년 전,1,
@ElSombraRegio7,"SO MUCH had to go right but also alot of big and little plays in that last minute for Cleveland won that title. I know alot of people praise that Lebron block, and then Kyrie's big 3, but not enough is said about the rest.   Kevin Love had an awesome awareness to have the foresight that Curry was going to rush a 3 and instead of waiting, he rushed the basket and secured a rebound. He could have let the ball roll out, but knew it would stop time, instead with CLE securing the possession it allowed them to wind the clock down (Then Lebron missed his hook, but had it gone in. The Dubz were in a bad spot).   In the next possession (Kyrie's 3). JR didn't rush the screen and once he got the switch, he did a quick little shuffle around Klay into the top of the arc but specifically in a range he can absolutely hit from thus forcing Klay to HAVE to stay on him (Good play call by Lu too). You can see as JR is shuffling in the right arc, and creeping - Klay has to turn his head and look at him for a brief second instead of taking the chance to help Curry, and as soon as his head turns back to Steph - Kyrie is going up for the shot. Also, Richard Jefferson waits an extra second before he runs down the block to the opposite corner (even as Kyrie is already starting his size up battle with Curry). Again, that extra second forced everyone to AHVE to pay attention to Rich instead of coming over to help curry at all.   The Dubz got to have their response but were met with wonderful rotation and switching on the Cavaliers end, and obviously Love did a great job defending Curry. Twice in the last 5 minutes did the dubz get that switch and twice Love shut Curry down.   When Irvin rushes down the court everyone else for Cleveland is still beyond the half-court line EXCEPT Love who again had the foresight to walk up and stay in an open neutral area (as we're taught in high school ball to run to the side of the court with the ball NO MATTER WHAT). Had he not done that, Kyrie would have been trapped and likely turned the ball over. This gave Cleveland the ability to drain crucial seconds off the clock, which then led to the foul, and then led to the attempted Lebron dunk turned shooting foul.   All those small things matter. The big plays are the ones remembered, but the small plays are the ones that enable the big highlights to even happen.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@idarci7202,Because the series was 3-3 after Golden State had a historic season. This would have been icing on the cake for Golden State. It was Curry’s time to step up and he couldn’t handle the pressure. Lebron returned from Heat to give the Cavs the championship. We have 2 of the greatest players of all time go head to head in a championship game in a series that historically the Cavs shouldn’t have won. Cavs came back from a major deficit in the series. Lebron could have retired here and his legacy would have been summited. Like what more do you want? This is a all time sports moment. ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED? WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?  Sure curry bricked his 3s but can you blame him? He was locked down the whole game and under immense pressure. He knew this game would effect his legacy and it did. He was embarrassed and ridiculed that he couldn’t bring home the series. For years after people said Curry couldn’t play under pressure and started to question his future.,2년 전,0,

@SubIfYouLikeMyContentBro,"Why do people just judge Steph Curry from this series/game?? Look, most of Steph’s shots back then were from screens, but now he can shoot shots from screens still, but also he can shoot while being defended very well and make shots from anywhere anyhow. So he really changed after that season/finals. He also really matured and just got better from back then. Also, people don’t realize but Steph didn’t even play that good in this series, he just had a good game 3 but that’s it, Draymond Green was the best player of the series, he was great both defensively and offensively. He was the main and best contributor in the WHOLE series! Until he got freaking suspended in game 6 which was a huge loss and meltdown for the Warriors and the collapse starting from there, especially because then it ruined the Warrior’s confidence and motivation. So yeah, wasn’t impressive on the Cavs side but rather a questionable meltdown and collapse on the Warriors side. Steph didn’t play good that series and had more turnovers than assists, But Steph has definitely changed and improved and just got purely better from that time and has moved on, like everyone else should. This was young and immature Steph Curry so people need to move on like how he did himself and stop basing his whole career on this because that’s just simply not right so yeah.

MJ was the biggest trash talker and an overall asshole, but people still respect him and very few are still to this day really bitter about how he manipulated and treated them when he was playing.

@firpomaan5544,"I watch the refs burn The Warriors 3 games straight. They reffed against The Warriors in last 3  games I believe.  I think Steph is the greatest shooter since Larry Bird. I've never seen anything like Curry in my lifetime besides Bird, he was a way better passer but Curry is a much better 3 point shooter which a lot has to do with just normal evolution of the game. Curry  he has the best net sense I've ever seen. Lebron isn't shit IMO skill wise infront of Steph, Labron just uses his size to drive the net and dunk. He stands infront of the net and everybody feeds him points and that moves him up the alltime points leader, I don't think he's even as good as Kobe was, Kobe brought allot more skill and game to the court. Labron might be 1 of the most over rated players, points don't tell nearly enough of the skill set a player carries. Don't get me Wrong Labron is a great player but I would choose Steph over Labron every single time. I don't think Labron would make my all time favourites team.   He knows exactly where the net is at all times.  Curry has revolutionized the game, from this point forward now in the NBA  it will become an all 3point shots game, there will be no more driving the net or slam dunks you will only see that on rebounds but the shooters will become so skilled their shooting be close to 100%. If you think about it the game is poised to go that direction, the most effient way to play would be to play an all out 3point game.",3년 전,0,

@helterskelter416,"if the warriors had chris paul or john wall, or any real point guard during this game, it would have been an easy win for them. he had 2 assists in this entire game. the possession where love defended him into oblivion he had a wiiiiiiide open player and a player cutting to the rim he could have connected with, but was too focused on trying to take advantage of the rules that made him able to look like a superstar and draw contact on love with a 3, missing terribly when love didn't make the contact with him he wanted, and essentially losing the warriors the game.   he's a ""point guard"" with little court vision and below average talent as a facilitator, and he is a well below average defender who has always been carried by his team's excellent defenders. and people want to talk about him as a goat X'D . you can't have that many holes in your game and be so poor at AN ENTIRE HALF OF THE GAME in defense and be an all time great. he's like steve kerr+, playing during a time when rules were designed to make it easier to make 3's and completely neutering defenders, and for a huge market team with the benefit of the referees and league adoring him. in reality, you swap him out with lillard, or paul, or even harden back then and that team gets better, swap him with any other good shooter, korver for example, and they stay the same. that team won with curry carried on the backs of the work green and thompson did on defense. curry was replaceable, but thompson and green were vital to that team.",3년 전,0,

@helterskelter416,"5:00 curry has ok-ish foot positioning (besides them being too far apart), encouraging irving to go to curry's left rather than down the center, but no hands! his right hand ought to be in that space in front of irving palm up to discourage him driving to curry's right, which is the point of positioning your feet like that, and to discourage him from switching hands on his dribble or try to cross him over (both of which are things irving is known to love). his other hand is back behind him like he's naruto running XD, while there isn't really a passing lane open for him to block with that hand, he doesn't know that cus he doesn't have good awareness and is positioned awkwardly to see the court anyways (which is admittedly not his fault, just due to where he is and how he is defending), but having that hand up also makes it easier to get it up higher to contest or block a shot, which would at least discourage irving from shooting a little. instead both his hands are in terrible position, and his too-wide stance leaves him unable to move quickly enough to prevent irving from simply stepping to the side and taking a shot. he's too low and too slow to get up and in front of him to contest the shot that is at that point obviously coming, and obviously coming from a step back in that direction, and with his left hand not being where it should he isn't able to get it up to contest the shot, which was the hand he ought to have used as it was closer to irving when he stepped to his right. instead he starts to turn his body more encouraging him to drive, but at that point it makes no difference, and now he has to twist his body to get his right hand up to contest the shot.   i'm not trying to sound like an expert, these are basic, fundamental defense tools that you learn in like middle school. curry doesn't know them, or does but doesn't have the presence of mind to use them properly. he and the warriors get smokes as a result. his lack of defensive skill loses them the game and this series XD",3년 전,0,

@gideondavid30," @Sage-cv8er  good is not great. That does matter when you are the best player on the team and the difference maker. Just look at the 2022 FINALS series with Boston. Curry had to carry his team on his back in Game 4.   I don't think it was just Curry playing with an injury (no matter how severe it was though).  IT was combination of factors to include the suspension of Green and Bogut going out in Game 5. Throw in questionable officiating and Iggy's injury, the series took a turn for the worse.  Unless you can explain to me how the inferior Warriors teams were able go up 3-1 on the Cavs, you have consider the factors that I have mentioned.",3년 전(수정됨),0,
@Sage-cv8er," @gideondavid30  bro what i was saying, is that that injury can't really explain currys performance in the 2016 finals. Why are you bringing up the 2022 finals? The warriors still was able to come back from the thunder when they had a 3-1 lead against them, even though curry was ""injured."" Curry just didn't play good in the finals and they blew a 3-1 lead.",3년 전,0,
@gideondavid30," @Sage-cv8er    WHy can't it explain  Curry's performance? If you are injured, you are going to underperform. THis isn't ROCKET SCIENCE. I understand that injuries play a role in professional sports, so I am not upset about it. It is what it is.  Yes, the Warriors came back 3-1 against OKC and why is that?  DO you have any analysis for that?  Why do you think that happened? Warriors regrouped in Game 5 and protected the homecourt. Thompson has a historic game in Game 6, and then the Warriors have home court in Game 7.   My point was that the Warriors don't go up 3-1 on the CAVS if they were the inferior team.  It wasn't like those first 4 games could have gone either way and where highly competitive either.   I gave you analysis for why the Warriors folded. It wasn't just Curry's injury either.  1) Green suspension in a CLOSE OUT GAME that wouldn't have alllowed the CAVS to get momentum.  2) Bogut their post defensive player goes out with an injury in Games 5 or 6 (can't remember). His lack of presence was felt and Lebron  and IRVING took advantage.  3) Games 5-6 were poorly officiated. How often does Curry foul out of a game?   4) Yes, Curry and Iggy were playing injured.",3년 전(수정됨),0,
@Sage-cv8er," @gideondavid30  so basically, it wasn't because of curry being injured, that basically had nothing to do with them losing those finals which was your point. If the warriors came back from a 3-1 lead from the thunder and curry isn't playing bad with his ""injury"", then he should be playing even better in the finals because he has even more time to heal from his ""injury."" He should be playing even better in the finals because he less injured.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

There is an asterisk by that title.  Wouldn't you agree?   I understand though that injuries are part of the game. I am entitled to my opinion too. I believe the Warriors were a better team than the Cavs even without Durant. IF both teams were 100%, I believe the Warriors would win. You are free to disagree though.  The reality is though that in 2016 the Warriors were hampered with injuries and suspensions (and bad officiating). That is all that I am saying.

That said, it was a very high risk, high reward scenario.  I spent $3,000 for an 18th row ticket.  My heart raced the entire game. Didn’t eat and maybe took a sip of water all 48 minutes (severe dry mouth).  Fast forward to when Kyrie hit the go-ahead 3 pointer (5:03)…this 65 year old woman, only fan near me, from Cleveland (I never met before) literally pulled an Elaine Benes and pushed me so hard and starting shaking me with complete and utter shock…”Holy sh*t…we may actually win this thing.”…and sure enough….I took a $3000 risk on the greatest NBA game of all time. 😊 PS: My profile pic is me at the game wearing the CLE shirt.",3년 전(수정됨),2.5천,

Were you guys able to hang around by the floor after the locker room celebration for when some of the Cavs came back on court for the NBA TV interviews? Or did everybody get kicked out before then.

@jordynstief3225,"Meanwhile during the final moments of Game 7 of the NBA 2016 Finals... Mike Breen: 6.5 seconds remain on the clock here in the fourth quarter as the Cleveland Cavaliers lead 123-89, thanks to their feminine friend, Temporary Cleveland Cavalier #26, Queen Madame Ninja Barrett. Not much is known about this sports star from the wrestling circuit other than her ability to predict the movements and read the patterns of her opponents. Queen Madame Ninja Barrett: (with the basketball in her possession.) Okay. You can do this, Ninja. Time to send the Cleveland Curse running for the hills. I have to be mindful, though. There's only 6 seconds left, after all. (readying her special shot as she channels her heart and soul into the ball.) All of Cleveland's pain, heartache, sorrow, agony, strife, anguish, heartbreak, torment, all 52 years of it, it officially dies tonight! Let my purification and revitalization reign over Cleveland. unleashes a Super Saiyan scream (goes Super Saiyan, much to the surprise of both teams.) Alright. Let's see if you can handle this. I'll be the one to reverse this. Me. Me! I'm going to defeat you. Time to shift the dynamic of Cleveland, provide a miracle for the first time since '64, return the city to it's former glory, change it's fate, quench this drought, erase the 52 years bad luck and rewrite history. I'm calling this one the Curse Breaker's Drought Quenching Kiss of Death.  Mo Williams: (watches as she prepares to throw her special shot.) Oh my word. Oh, she's a god if she makes this. Ninja: (throws her special shot from the half court and watches as it goes in.) Okay. Hopefully, that should do it. Mike: It's now 126-89. I don't know what happened, but the Cavaliers have now soared into a staggering lead. buzzer sounds Mike: It's over. It's over. Cleveland's a city of champions once again. The Cavaliers are NBA Champions. Cleveland's long sports nightmare has ended. The drought is over. 52 years, time to celebrate a title. Ninja: (as she transforms back to normal, gracefully drops the basketball onto the court and dusts off her hands.) blows the smoke from her hands Well, I'm sure this'll make for an interesting MVP conversation. chuckles to herself (sees her fellow Cleveland Cavaliers approaching her.) Oh. I take it this means the Cleveland Curse is broken? Kevin Love: I guess so. Isiah Thomas: Well, you certainly gave the Warriors a show they'll never forget. Kyrie Irving: Judging by your performance, I won't put it past you if you somehow manage to beat LeBron James for Finals MVP. Ninja: No, I've got a feeling that he'll still get that accolade in the end. You figure, there was a letter that he wrote to his fans 2 years ago that made it clear that he was coming home to bring Cleveland a championship. So, based on that, he's still got a slight edge against me, but we'll see what my dear friend, NBA Commissioner, Adam Silver has to say. J.R. Smith: Oh, that's true. Tristan Thompson: Wait. So, how many points did you end up getting us? Ninja: (points at the final scoreboard.) Look at the final score and be thankful you guys have me on a temporary Cavaliership. All: (look at the final score.) Whoa. Kevin: Okay. I did the math and looks like she extended our lead by 37 points. Ninja: Yep. Hey, wait a minute. Where's LeBron? Kevin: (points to him on his knees.) Oh, he's over there letting his emotions let loose knowing that he finally fulfilled his promise to the city that drafted him all those years ago. Ninja: I see. Mike: And the emotions for LeBron James who delivers on his promise to come home and bring a championship to his beloved hometown and of course the disappointment, the stunning disappointment on the other end. James Jones, his long time teammate, who’s been with him through all 6 consecutive finals and an emotional Tyronn Lue. LeBron James: Oh my god. James Jones: (approaches and embraces her.) You did it, kid. You did it. You helped us break the Cleveland Curse. Ninja: I'm kind of aware of this. Now, can you please let me approach your teammate so I can comfort him? James: Oh, certainly. Ninja: Thank you. (approaches, takes him in her arms, holds and comforts him.) LeBron: Kid, you absolutely killed it. Ninja: Thank you, Monsieur James. Well, I've got a feeling that my Lone Wolf boyfriend and SmackDown tag partner will probably be here soon. I probably should let Commissioner Silver know to be expecting him. (texts her dear friend, the NBA Commissioner to let him know to expect the Lone Wolf.) There we go. The message has been sent. I think I'm gonna stick around for the trophy presentation and then just go. Iman Shumpert: Alright. Richard Jefferson: Okay. Channing Frye: Well, kid. That was certainly an impressive showing. Matthew Dellavedova: So, what exactly brought you to Cleveland? Ninja: Fate and a desire to learn more about the Cleveland Curse as I've recently grown interested in learning about sports related curse phenomenons in certain cities and certain states. Meanwhile at the front entrance of the Oracle Arena... AJ Hawk: (in the car to the Lone Wolf.) Alright, man. I think this is where you get off. Baron Corbin: (exits the car.) Keep the car running. AJ: Got it. Baron: (enters the arena, clearly ready to begin his hunt for his Lone Wolfess.) Alright. I'm here, my Lone Wolfess. Where are you? (notices another man approaching him.) Oh, looks like this man's a friend of my Lone Wolfess. Adam Silver: Welcome. I am NBA Commissioner, Adam Silver. I take it you must be Ninja's lover? Baron: Yes, (as he shakes the NBA Commissioner's hand.) Baron Corbin. Adam: Oh, yes. Ninja told me to be expecting you. You're actually just in time for the trophy presentation. Follow me right this way. I'll take you to her. (leads him to the podium as it's being set up on the court for the trophy presentation to find his dear friend.) Baron: Coming, Mr. Silver. (follows the NBA Commissioner out to the podium as it's being set up on the court for the trophy presentation in order to find his Lone Wolfess.) Yeah. I deeply apologize for bothering you about this, Mr. Silver, but I just want to fetch my Lone Wolfess and bring her back to Las Vegas so she can wrap up Money In The Bank. Adam: It's no problem at all, sir. (to the Lone Wolf as they enter the basketball court, ready to locate their feminine friend.) By the way, since you’re here, would you like to witness the trophy presentation? Baron: Sure. Queen Madame Ninja Barrett: (notices the two men as she changes back into her normal attire and motions them over to where she is.) Baron: Oh, there you are, my Lone Wolfess. As soon as we witness the trophy presentation, you and I need to head back over to Money In The Bank in Las Vegas. Ninja: Understood. Mike Breen: What a scene, an emotional scene for LeBron James. These diehard fans, so passionate. They so love their teams, decades of heartbreak of being teased, but it never diminished their passion and now, they’re rewarded with an NBA Championship. As always, the terrific sportsmanship. So much more to come here from Oracle Arena as LeBron James and the Cavaliers win the NBA Championship and the celebration just underway in the city of Cleveland. Let’s go to Doris. Doris Burke: Mike, overcome with emotion is exactly how I would describe LeBron’s reaction as he shares a hug with Kyrie. I’ll give him a minute, but he’s still crying tears (as someone bumps into her.) of joy. (approaches him.) LeBron. Kyrie Irving: Oh, I’m sorry, Doris. Doris: No, no worries, Kyrie. LeBron, as soon as that buzzer sounded, your emotions let loose. Can you describe what you’re feeling right now? LeBron James: I set out a goal, two years. I gave everything that I have. I put my heart and my blood and my sweat and my tears in this game and against all odds, against all odds, I don’t know why we want to take the hardest road. I don’t know why the man above gave me the hardest road but there’s nothing the man above going to put new situations that you can’t handle. And I just kept the same, positive at attitude like, instead of saying why me? I was saying this is what he wanted me to do. Cleveland, this is for you! Doris: LeBron, you did what no other team had been able to do, coming back from a 3-1 deficit in the Finals and to do that, you had to win twice in a place that proved too much for so many teams. What did you find in Game 5 here? LeBron: Just locked in. I had to change my approach a little bit on how I approach the game. I wasn’t that good in the first two games here in this building. I watched a lot of film, detailed it out, changed my blueprint and was able to put together some spectacular games after being down 3-1. History, we in the record books. We the first team ever to come back from a 3-1 deficit. This is special. Doris: We’ll see you in a few minutes on the podium for the trophy presentation. LeBron: Alright. Thank you, Doris. Mike: One of the great storybook endings in all of sports. And it looked like earlier in the Finals like it was going to end like so many other seasons for the Cleveland sports teams with a defeat and a wait til next year. And LeBron James and the Cavaliers win 3 straight, 2 here in Oracle Arena. Has there ever been a player more valuable to his team than James has been in Cleveland the last two years? You think about what he was able to accomplish, coming back to Cleveland, making a statement, taking a team that had been awful the previous four years and flat out got it done. Those four years he was in Miami, Cleveland had the worst record in the NBA during that stand. He comes back, back to back Finals and a championship season for the city of Cleveland. Final score, Game 7: Cavaliers 126, Warriors 89. We’ll be back to Oracle Arena for the trophy presentation as LeBron James and the Cavaliers win the NBA Championship. Adam: Well then, if everything's prepared and everyone's ready, let's get this trophy presentation started.",3년 전,1,

@jordynstief3225,"Meanwhile as the trophy presentation’s getting underway... Mike Breen: A shocking ending for Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors who lose their last two games in Oracle Arena, the most dominant home court in the NBA over the past two years as they fail to repeat, coming up short in Game 7 against the Queen Madame Ninja Barrett led Cleveland Cavaliers. LeBron James came back home to deliver a championship to his hometown. He fulfilled his promise tonight with a spectacular road performance in the 4th quarter to win the championship. Let’s get the ceremony going right now to our PA announcer, Matt Hurwitz. Matt Hurwitz: Ladies and gentlemen, please direct your attention to center court for the presentation of the Larry O’Bryant trophy and the 2016 Bill Russel NBA Finals Most Valuable Player award. Please welcome ABC’s Doris Burke. Doris Burke: Ladies and gentlemen, with us tonight to present the 2016 NBA Championship trophy, please welcome NBA Commissioner, Adam Silver. Adam Silver: You just witnessed one of the greatest games in NBA history. To the Golden State Warriors, congratulations on a historic season. To Joe Lacob, Peter Guber and Coach Kerr, you’re all a class act and the NBA thanks you. And now, Dan Gilbert, your partners, your family, Coach Lue and your terrific Cleveland Cavaliers, congratulations, you’re the first team in the history of the NBA to come back from a 3-1 deficit to win the championship. And to Northeast Ohio and Cleveland, the curse is over. The 52 year drought has come to an end. Let me present the championship trophy. (presents the NBA Championship trophy.) Doris: Dan, we had shots all night, Dan of your fans back in Cleveland. You said you felt an obligation to bring a title to those hungry fans. Why? Dan Gilbert: People of Cleveland deserves it more than any people I’ve ever seen, met or felt. And thank God that God loves Cleveland, Ohio. He does and I want to thank everybody. I want to thank David Griffin and the front office, Ty and the coaching staff, everybody in the entire franchise, the best fans in the world and LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers. Doris: Well, that trophy found an appropriate person to carry it. When LeBron left in the fashion that he did after the first time, could you ever have envisioned him returning and fulfilling this dream? Dan: I couldn’t hear you exactly, Doris, but all I know is that no group deserves this more, no fan base deserves this more. And I’m speechless and proud of everybody. It’s like a fantasy for everybody and thank you, Cleveland. Love you, Cleveland. And thank you to the Golden State Warriors and Joe Lacob. You’re a class act. It was a great series, great series. Doris: Congratulations. Ty Lue. Ty, there was a point in which you were down 3-1, but your confidence never faltered. What was it about the character of this group that you never doubted them? Tyronn Lue: Just, we’ve been through adversity all year and you know, we went through a lot and you know, God’s counted us out, you know, they said we couldn’t get it done, but it ain’t about me, it’s about the guys. You know, I’d go to war with these guys any night, any day and they stuck with it and we had a chance to give up. We made history tonight and I told these guys, “You know, all year we’ve been making history, why not tonight?” So, these guys came out, had a great showing, I’ll go to war, battle with these guys every single night. I just want to give a shout-out to Mexico, Missouri and Cleveland, Ohio. We’re coming back, baby. Let’s go! Doris: Ty, you’ve played alongside some of the all time greats. Shaq, Kobe, Michael, we are witnessing a once in the generation players in LeBron James. What makes this man so extraordinarily special? Tyronn: You know, outside of his basketball talent, that’s what you look at when you see on the floor is the basketball talent, the way you control a game and take over a game and things like that, but the biggest thing for LeBron, the reason why he deserves this is because he has a great heart and he’s always giving. He’s given to everyone and it’s not just about basketball. It’s about who he is as a person and great things happen to great people. So, I’m just happy for LeBron. I’m happy for the city of Cleveland, the state of Ohio, the Cleveland Cavaliers organization and Mexico, Missouri. We in the house, baby. Doris: Two shout-outs for Mexico. Congratulations. Time now to bring back NBA Commissioner, Adam Silver to present the MVP award. Adam: As you can see, there are two MVP trophies on this podium, one obviously recognizing the Finals MVP and the other one for the new category we’re opening up today, recognizing the Curse Breaker MVP. Two years ago, he wrote a letter to his fans in which he said, “I’m coming home.” And he said that nothing is given to you in Northeast Ohio, everything is earned. LeBron, it was unanimous. Most Valuable Player 2016, NBA Finals. Congratulations. (hands him the MVP trophy.) Now, for the Curse Breaker MVP. Despite the fact that she didn’t get involved until the second half, her multiple Curse Breaker shots were more than enough to break this curse and quench this 52 year drought. (turns toward her.) My friend, it was unanimous. The inaugural 2016 Curse Breaker MVP, NBA Finals. Congratulations. (shakes her hand, embraces her and presents her the inaugural Curse Breaker MVP trophy.) Queen Madame Ninja Barrett: (takes the inaugural Curse Breaker MVP trophy from her dear friend, the NBA Commissioner.) Doris: LeBron, in the letter that Adam Silver referenced, you said that the most important thing to you was to bring a championship to Northeast Ohio. Why was that so important? LeBron James: I understood what the people of Northeast Ohio been through the last 50+ years. I kept it at bay. I never stressed the fact that I didn’t feel the pressure, that none of those things so it always kept me level headed, but I understood what everyone in Northeast Ohio been through the last 50+ years and I’m happy to be a part of history. I can’t wait to get back home. I’m ready to get to you guys. Doris: What kind of character did it require of a group that had so many playing in their first NBA Finals to come out and win on this floor? LeBron: We’ve been through so much adversity these last two years. I just knew what we was capable of, even being down 3-1 versus the greatest regular season team ever. You know, 73-9 and everybody counted us out and that’s where we strive most when everybody counted us out and that’s definitely where I strive the most when everyone counted me out. Doris: LeBron, you won two titles in Miami and I know they meant the world to you. Why does this one feel different? LeBron: I’m home. I’m home. This is what I came back for. I’m at a loss for words. This is unbelievable. It doesn’t feel real right now. Doris: Congratulations, LeBron. LeBron: Thank you, Doris. Thank you so much. Doris: Kyrie Irving, are you around me? Kyrie, a year ago, you were alone in the hospital room watching your team do battle and try to win an NBA Championship. Can you describe what it was like for you going to battle and ultimately fulfilling one of your childhood dreams you said? Kyrie Irving: History was made tonight, but I mean, that championship team that’s in that locker room right there, we’ve got to give them a lot of credit. They did an amazing job and for us, it was just about being resilient and coming in to take care of business, but I mean, this is one for the books. Literally, one for the books. Doris: Down the stretch, though, it had been tough at times, difficult series for Kevin Love. The big three was able to deliver. Why was that? Kyrie: Just staying aggressive, sticking to the game plan and executing offensively and defensively, but I’m glad all the X’s and O’s are done and we can celebrate this championship. Doris: Can you describe what it’s like playing alongside of LeBron James and what effect he has on this group’s ability to be confident that it can win regardless of the circumstance? Kyrie: Best player on the planet right there. As you can see with the Finals MVP, he took us home tonight and that’s what he does. That’s what great players do and he made history tonight. And I’m proud of him. Doris: Congratulations. Tristan Thompson. I don’t know many guys, Tristan, that would embrace so readily the dirty work that you pursue on a nightly basis. Why? Why are you so able to embrace that role? Tristan Thompson: It’s a starting role. I like to look at a championship team as a puzzle. Everyone has, you know, the roles. Some guys score, the fan and for me, just do the dirty work and just be a starting role. Doris: You told us yesterday that your Father is responsible for the toughness that you display and it is Father’s Day and he can’t be here, but I know he’s watching. What would you say to him? Tristan: Thank you for everything, just the toughness, the work ethic he instilled in our family. I love you, Pops. Doris: I’ll put the same question to you. You’re playing alongside a once in a generation player in LeBron James. What makes this man so great? Tristan: Michael Jackson said he’s a bad, bad man, Doris. Just how he’s able to elevate everyone’s game and just help us young guys, show us what it takes to win a championship. Doris: Congratulations, Tristan. And congratulations to the 2016 NBA Champions, Cleveland Cavaliers. Baron Corbin: Okay. I think maybe we should go. Ninja: Right. Well, I'd hate to take the inaugural Curse Breaker MVP trophy and go, but let's just say that I have some business to attend to on the squared circle home front. Both: (leave the basketball court.)",3년 전,1,
@jordynstief3225,"After the events of Game 7 of the NBA 2016 Finals... Both: (arrive at the front entrance of the Oracle Arena.) Baron Corbin: (texts his accomplice to let him know that he's with his Lone Wolfess.) Okay. I just texted Mr. Hawk. Queen Madame Ninja Barrett: (with the inaugural Curse Breaker MVP trophy in her possession.) Wait. Monsieur Hawk accompanied you to get me? Baron: (nods in response to his Lone Wolfess's question.) Yes. Ninja: Oh, you and Monsieur Hawk are so sweet. Yeah. I kinda feel bad for Monsieur Hawk right now, knowing that he's going to have to drive home in an insane amount of traffic in Cleveland due to the celebration taking place that'll extend to the entirety of Ohio itself. Baron: I'm sure he'll be fine. Ninja: Yeah. You're right. ???: (approaching them.) calls out to them in a familiar voice Wait. Ninja. Both: (turn to see the NBA Commissioner approaching them.) Ninja: (to her dear friend, the NBA Commissioner.) Oh, Monsieur Silver. Have you come to walk us out? Adam Silver: Yes, I have. Look, I know you're currently preparing to return to the ring as I'm sure your obligation as the premier fighter's calling, but Mr. Gilbert (as he reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a folded piece of paper given to him by the majority owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers.) wanted me to give you this before you left. Ninja: (takes the folded piece of paper from her dear friend, the NBA Commissioner.) Thank you, Monsieur Silver. (unfolds it and takes a look at it before looking up at her dear friend, the NBA Commissioner in confusion.) What the heck even is this? Adam: Listen, Mr. Gilbert was so impressed by your performance in Game 7 tonight here at the Oracle Arena against the Golden State Warriors that he wanted to offer you an extension of your Temporary Cleveland Cavaliership. Ninja: Well, dang. That's rather generous. (pulls out a pen.) I'll need to borrow a table. Adam: Oh, here. (brings over a small table.) I think we can use this. Ninja: Oh, how convenient. (sets the extension of the Temporary Cleveland Cavaliership down on the table.) Let's just do ourselves a favor and get this over with. clicks pen (signs the extension of her Temporary Cleveland Cavaliership.) There we go. (passes it back to her dear friend, the NBA Commissioner.) Adam: (retrieves the signed extension of her Temporary Cleveland Cavaliership from his dear friend to give back to the majority owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers.) Thank you. So, the extension of your Temporary Cleveland Cavaliership won't come into effect until October. Ninja: October. Wait. That's when the Cavaliers have their ring ceremony, right? Adam: Yes. Ninja: So, since I'm the inaugural Curse Breaker MVP, that means that I'll probably receive my championship ring either second to last or last. Adam: Yes. That's the long and the short of it. We're just not sure which way it'll be yet. Ninja: Okay. Baron: (to his Lone Wolfess's dear friend, the NBA Commissioner.) You know, I think I'm starting to understand why my Lone Wolfess gravitates toward you so much. Like her, you emit a sense of calm and have, in your own way, become like a pillar of strength. Adam: Wow. I guess I really never thought of it like that. Oh, do you both want me to escort you out? Ninja: If you wouldn't mind, Monsieur Silver. Adam: Alright. In that case, follow me. (leads them to the door of Oracle Arena.) Both: (follow the NBA Commissioner out of the Oracle Arena.) Adam: Okay. (turns toward his dear friend.) Well, my friend. The Cavaliers and I will see you in October at the Quicken Loans Arena for the ring ceremony. Ninja: Alright. See you then, Monsieur Silver.  Both: (walk out of Oracle Arena and toward the waiting vehicle.) AJ Hawk: (pulls up to the entrance of the Oracle Arena.) Hey. You guys ready to blow this popsicle stand? Baron: Ready as we'll ever be, Hawk. Both: (get in the car and drive away.) AJ: I can't believe it. The inaugural Curse Breaker MVP. Alright. So, the plan is I'm going to drop the two of you off at the arena in Las Vegas and then just go. Baron: That's fine. Ninja: Yeah. Well, I appreciate the both of you doing this, but I could probably just teleport myself and the Lone Wolf to the arena. AJ: Hey. It's no problem at all. Ninja: Yeah. Hey, listen. I feel bad for you right now, knowing that you're going to have to drive home in an insane amount of traffic due to the celebration taking place in Cleveland that I'm sure will soon be extending to the entirety of Ohio itself. AJ: Yeah. I'm sure it's going to be insane by the time I get back home. A while later in Las Vegas during Money In The Bank... AJ Hawk: (pulls up to the arena.) Alright, guys. I think this is where the both of you get off. Both: (exit the car.) Queen Madame Ninja Barrett: (with the inaugural Curse Breaker MVP trophy in her possession.) Alright. Thanks, Hawk. Just be careful getting home. AJ: Okay. (drives away.) Baron Corbin: Alright. Now, let's get inside and finish the Money In The Bank pay per view. Ninja: Of course, mi amor. I think I kept my Shield brothers waiting long enough. Both: (enter the arena.) Ninja: (takes the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.) Alright. Let's do this. Here. (gives the Lone Wolf her inaugural Curse Breaker MVP trophy.) Would you mind running that into my black metallic kingdom locker room for me while I take care of my Shield brothers? Baron: (takes the inaugural Curse Breaker MVP trophy from his Lone Wolfess.) Of course. (runs it into her locker room.)",3년 전,1,

@hmmmmmmminteresting,It's funny how clueless LeBron is and how people ignore it. Sure he made that block. But ... That last epic shot by Kyrie it almost seems LeBron wasn't even on the court. If Kyrie missed it there is no way LeBron would rebound that. Kyrie made the biggest shot in NBA history. And then it was Kevin Love with amazing I mean amazing defense on Steph. These two players Kyrie and Love were tremendous. And we need to remember Tristan Thompson had incredible numbers in the finals too. Yet people almost think that LeBron did it by himself bla bla. This LeBron right here misses a free shot with 10 seconds to go ! A free shot! Think about that. He thinks he is the best player of all time and he can't even make the free throws in game 7 with 10 seconds to go.,3년 전,0,

A lot of pretty crazy things happened yeah sure but I mean seriously being satisfied with one championship not to mention the 3 world series the Indians were in since 95... 1 and 7 in championship series in the last 25 years really. I can't understand it, is it like they know they will never win another one so cherish the one and only one they got??",3년 전(수정됨),0,

Only to learn that Lebron came back to Cleveland only to rebuild his image and his brand. In the end LeBron didn't care about Cleveland or any city he has played for or any team he has played for.

Not even a mismatch, yet gets scored on.  5:17 - now he gets a mismatch in his favour but fails to capitalize. Should have blown pass Love but settled for a heavily contested three.   7:35 - misses a game saving three bringing his total to a 6-19 FG including a 4-14 from 3pt.  with 4 turnovers and only 2 assists as a point guard.  Considering how much sh*t LeBron gets for his 2011 finals it is shocking to me how people are not talking about this meltdown by Curry.",4년 전,1,

@theONE-ws8lh, @brandonrhodesmusic  it needed to happen to the cavs. Lebron used some pathetic tactics to come back making the league suspend Draymond when the warriors were already short handed. I wanted the cavs to win I’m from Ohio but what Lebron did was just disgraceful. He cried to the league in a post game interview and probably made some calls and 2 days later they changed the call they made in the game to a flagrant when it was obviously a regular foul. Lebron literally whined and got Draymond suspended to start a comeback. The agenda was set and the calls in game 6 were just purely rigged lol it was obvious I was ecstatic the cavs won but looking back it was obvious.,3년 전,1,

@theONE-ws8lh, @vincetaliaferro2777  it needed to happen to the cavs. Lebron used some pathetic tactics to come back making the league suspend Draymond when the warriors were already short handed. I wanted the cavs to win I’m from Ohio but what Lebron did was just disgraceful. He cried to the league in a post game interview and probably made some calls and 2 days later they changed the call they made in the game to a flagrant when it was obviously a regular foul. Lebron literally whined and got Draymond suspended to start a comeback. The agenda was set and the calls in game 6 were just purely rigged lol it was obvious I was ecstatic the cavs won but looking back it was obvious.,3년 전,1,

@manuginobilisbaldspot424," @boratwilson9916  Where was MJ before 6-0...the same as LeBron, ringless because of a lack of supporting squad. Here's the differences: MJ made six postseason appearances in those first six years. LeBron missed the playoffs twice in those first eight seasons without a ring. MJ lost six series, all as a road underdog. In other words, his teams weren't expected to win...again BECAUSE his team did not have the overall talent to beat two legendary championship teams in the Bird Celtics and Bad Boy Pistons. Never once though, did MJ fail to show up in defeat. LeBron lost THREE TIMES with home court advantage and being a clear favorite twice...against the 09 Magic and 11 Mavs. MJ never scored single digits in the Finals. Or got outplayed in a Finals by a journeyman like Jason Terry. As great as LeBron has been in the last 10 years, it's telling that he STILL only has four rings, when MJ won six the moment HE started to win. Those of you trying to use LeBron having more years actually strengthens MJ's hold on GOAT status because he got his achievements much more efficiently than LeBron did. Six rings, six Finals MVPs, five MVP. Zero home court series losses, zero Finals losses. Y'all try to devalue who MJ beat...because you can't use a loss against him. That's how great he was, dozens of Hall of Famers came at him but could not beat him once he had what he needed. I'm a Lakers fan and have LeBron at #3 behind Jabbar. I have tremendous respect for his game and legacy. But I saw MJ. Not on YouTube, not with a bunch of Gen Z stans trying to slander his opposition...but live. As it happened. I've never seen a player before or since that scared opponents more. Teams didn't really feel they could win, because the Bulls had Jordan. I've never seen that with LeBron.",3년 전,3,

@epic7608," @thew23032  Instead of calling him LeMickey, you should call him LeNoNeedForHomeCourtAdvantage since in the bubble the lakers had a homecourt advantage stripped from them which they worked all year for as the 1st seed. Lebron is also literally the most experienced player in the NBA Playoff history so the lack of a real crowd benefitted him the least of it benefitted anybody at all. The season suspension als allowed Nurkic to return from injury for the blazers which gave the lakers a tougher first round matchup than they would have had the season suspension never happened. The season suspension and bubble situation made the championship tougher for the lakers if anything so instead of you calling LeBron ""LeMickey"" because of the bubble championship you should start calling it a LeGitimate championship because that's what it is.",3년 전,0,

He cried to the league in a post game interview and probably made some calls and 2 days later they changed the call they made in the game to a flagrant when it was obviously a regular foul.

KD proved he can win w/o having Russ hold him back.. simple as that. He'd have won in OKC several years with a better PG. Hell, put KD on that 2015 Warriors team and KD, Kyrie, Love win. Lebron needs the ball to be effective which takes away from Kyrie's only actual benefit to the game. KD can do anything offensively and doesn't need the rock. Kyrie + KD are better suited whereas Lebron pairs better with a dominant big like AD. AD the most versatile big man to ever play the game.. and the 3rd most efficient player in NBA history behind MJ and Lebron. LAL are just as formidable as the 2017 GSW team. They had a MONSTER roster last year and lost in the 1st. Just because your team is stacked doesn't mean you're gonna win.. injuries happen. Otherwise, KD wins 3 years in a row in Toronto.

Lebron made the finals because the best team in the league was always in the western conference (usually the top 2 teams). When Jordan played the best team in the league was in the Eastern conference. It's no different losing to the best team in the finals or in the conference finals. By your logic Lebron's Cavs were better than Harden's Rockets simply because thwg made the finals in 2018 despite the Rockets pushing the Warriors to 7 games while the Cavs got mercilessly destroyed in 4. You'd essentially be arguing that the Cavs were better than the Rockets because of geography lmao (East rather than West).

Have you seen anything like that Shannon? a 73 win team with the greatest backcourt in the history of the game? ouff Hear me out here, 3:25 left in the 4th quarter, little Kyrie Irving allowed Klay to pull up on him a guy that cant dribble, really? what if it went in? huh and on the next possession, LeBron went to the cup and got foul by both Curry and  Iguodala but no foul called by these blind refs.    To me Shannon, the turning point is when LeBron got the rebound with 2:51 left and got fouled by Curry who Kyrie didn't box out by the way. The warriors went cold from that point on your man Kyrie almost blew it as he forced a shot with 1:55 left in the quarter.  I'm like what are you doing? Shannon help me out here, who came clutch as in K LUTCH and block the shot of shots? hmmh, LeBron Raymone King James. I've never seen anything like it.    You can all say what you want about the 3pt made by Kyrie, all I know is he had to redeem himself to almost cost LeBron the game.

The highest touted NBA prospect probably ever finally comes back home to the city he once betrayed and was down 3-1 against arguably one of the best NBA teams of all time. All the odds were stacked against them and Lebron instilled this belief that they could win. This series is the greatest testament to Lebron's value. Without Lebron on that team they may have not even made it past the first round let alone make the playoffs. Lebron brings a value to a team unlike any other. He's the most valuable player ever and the greatest basketball player of all time. I will likely get hate for this comment from Jordan stans and Lebron haters. I hope that when Lebron retires the haters appreciate his greatness. As someone once said, ""your hate for a player should never exceed the ability to appreciate the game of basketball.""",4년 전,0,

Of course, anyone would know just from reading your comments that this is a projection of what you THINK you know about LeBron James onto him. Its the same tired old narrative that Lebron James isn't clutch, doesn't have a killer mentality, shies away from big moments, yada yada. He went at iggy, and missed, as he had been all night. Curry took a shot and missed, as he had been all night. And on top of that, LeBron hadn't been getting calls as you can see in the video, so to waste a possession on a likely foul wouldn't have been a good move anyway.",4년 전,0,

@tyrionlannister8," @mumblezz__5890  Mj got the steal and hit the shot for his last chip. Lebron needed Kyrie to save him and avoided the iso with Klay guarding him. Nah. you know as well as I do that Lebron doesn’t listen to Ty Lue or any of his coaches. He’s incapable of being coached. He fired 2 of them. Lebron voluntarily took out the ball cuz he didn’t want it in his hands. By the way, since you guys like to bring up that Lebron has the most game winners in the playoffs,   Lebron is 0/7 for go ahead/ game tying shots IN THE FINALS in the last 25 seconds. Mj is 4/8 in the same situation. Mj is the definition of clutch, especially when it counts the most.   Say all you want about what he does in the first 10 minutes of the 4th quarter. But when it comes to a game winning bucket when he’s down a possession, he wants a bail out.   “Mj wasn’t even involved on a play to win one of his chips” hahahahaha. He capitalized on both the defensive and offensive sides to win his 6th chip. Watch when he stole the ball from Karl and made the shot. Lebron could never do that, especially in the finals.",4년 전,0,

@gtfgaming8243," @tyrionlannister8  bro you sound so stupid. Lebron is a pass first player, not a scorer. Do you even watch basketball? Lebron is ahead of Kobe and Jordan simply because of his IQ. He is smart enough to know that the right play is to pass instead of trying to take the last shot. Why would he shoot on a triple team when he can just pass it to the open man. Jordan and Kobe wouldn't have passed it in a situation like that. If Jordan played on those cavs teams he would average 60 points but not make the playoffs. Jordan needed a hof defender and hof playmaker to save his career. Lebron literally is that playmaker and defender and scorer. MJ and Kobe aren't team players. That is what separates them from Lebron's level. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcuf28mqhkA&t=336s listen to Gilbert Arenas talk on the matter. He is way more informed than both of us.

Kobe, before Phil was the same. Even Phil said that Jordan wasn’t on board with him stepping in as coach as Phil wanted other players to get more touches. They set aside their egos to play in a system. How is that not being a team player? The only difference is, they showed up as the alpha when it counted the most.

@tyrionlannister8," @gtfgaming8243  hahahahaha, you failed to realize that Jordan faced more 50+ win teams than Lebron in the playoffs. Jordan faced Larry Bird, averaging 40+ and series and lost. I like how you bring up him losing to Larry bird by with a team worse than what Lebron has, but you dismiss Lebron losing to KD and the Warriors. Do you see the double standard you’re using?   Mj faced the bad boy pistons, knicks, Orlando with shaq and penny, the pacers with Larry bird coaching and Reggie Miller, etc... Mj was playing in what was considered the harder conference in his time.   Lebron faced 40 win teams and the only team the East had to offer in 2016-2018 was the horrendous raptors. The only notable team Lebron has faced in the playoffs was the Celtics with Kg paul Pierce and rondo in which he JOINED MIAMI TO GET PAST THEM.   Mj had a much harder road to the finals than what Lebron had. Lebron had a harder finals competition but that’s debatable because according to the competition (as Lebronsexuals always like to bring up stats), Jordan faced more 60+ win teams in the finals than Lebron.

@dr.sinister9315,"@Dhk4: LeBron James fan here. I really enjoyed your post. I would like to add some more to it. Speaking of the KG/Ray Allen/Paul Pierce union which essentially created the ""Big Three"" topic of discussion back in 2008, which led to the Boston Celtics winning the NBA Championship that season, did anyone really seem to complain about that concept at the time? The answer is no. Fast Forward to 2010. LeBron James announces that he's decided to take his talents to Miami and sign with the Heat. Instantly, he becomes the most vilified and hated basketball player in the NBA. Even retired NBA players, most of whom were either Hall of Famers or All-Time Greats, spoke out against him seeking to join forces with two other proven NBA All-Star players, one of which had already led his team to an NBA Championship - that being Dwayne Wade. So, it was all fine and good for Boston to implement that concept and end up winning a championship as a result; but when LeBron James chose to join D-Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami to pursue that same goal, he was chastised, criticized, and disparaged constantly for it. That Miami team went to four straight NBA Finals and won two championships. Ironically, it was one of Boston's 2008 NBA Championship Big Three members, Ray Allen, who himself decided to leave the Celtics and sign with the 2012 defending NBA Champion Miami Heat - joining LeBron, D-Wade, and Chris Bosh for another successful championship run in 2013. LeBron returns to Cleveland in 2014, the Cavs lose to GSW in 6 games in the 2015 NBA Finals with Kevin Love out injured, and Kyrie Irving going down injured in Game 1 - missing the rest of that series as well. That brings us to Cleveland's victory in the 2016 NBA Finals. As a result of that, as you so accurately put it, GSW added Kevin Durant to a 73-9 team to beat LeBron. KD signed with GSW to pursue winning a championship. He got two rings while he was there. Yes, he took some criticism for that, however, it wasn't anywhere near the level that LBJ was subjected to. Your assessment of the Clippers was 100% on-point and laugh-out-loud funny as well. Their ""Dynamic Duo"" came up short against a talented and very competitive Denver team that did finish as the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference behind the Clippers at No. 2 and the Lakers at No. 1 - with their ""Dynamic Duo"" of AD & LBJ, plus Playoff Rajon Rondo leading the way to what is about to become the Lakers 17th NBA Championship in franchise history!! Stay Safe, Stay Strong, and Stay Well.",4년 전,80,

@j2jwhatsapp," @dr.sinister9315  I think the reason he got criticized for his Miami move was because of the way he did it. The decision was a slap in the face to his fans at Cleveland, cause they're tuning in thinking we'll ofcourse he's not gonna ditch us on live tv for the whole world to see, right ? And then he drops the bomb and everyone's hurt. Had he just quietly gone off to miami I don't think so many people would've criticized him. Plus Miami was always the plan if Cleveland didn't work out, it was because of that he signed a 3 year deal and convinced bosh and wade of the same as well so that in due time, they could join forces.",4년 전,3,

@j2jwhatsapp," @jasonn2284  what about defense and role players and other scorers. One or two additions donot solve all your problems, the cavs were really bad in 2017, the addition of dame wouldn't have made them a championship winning team. This tbe same reason why I'm worried about lakers too because barring ad and LeBron, ain't nobody nearly as consistent on defense or offense, look at the game today, the ONLY reason they won is because everyone in that team had double digits scoring numbers. One two or even 3 good players on a team won't win you games if the rest of the team isn't consistent",4년 전,0,

But this is exactly what I don't like about Lebron and his fans its always just about Lebron even if its other players that actually win games just like kyrie who people talk about but without kyrie No rings in Cleveland and Lebron know it.and if this is Lebron best championship beating that least talented team in NBA finals history then something is seriously wrong.

@markfish1113, @ronaldjackson7541  Heat lost to Mavericks due to playing through Wade. The next seasons they become smarter and play through Lebron. Lebron was the best player in that Heat team.,4년 전,0,
@ronaldjackson7541, @markfish1113  man you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about wade damn near single handedly beat Dallas in their prime with the over the hill gang. Who all retired very soon afterwards some of them the next year Every sport's fan and sports Media know that it was lebron that cost the already championship Heat team the title Man at least try to make sense Lebron is a good physical player who's biggest goal is stat chasing and may be a better physical player than wade but he has and will never have the heart or killer instinct like wade and any real basketball fan knows that.,4년 전,0,
@ronaldjackson7541, @costanostra2447  The fact is lebron is like a person shooting pool that can get seven balls in quicker than everyone else But can't get that 8th one to go but you are right  Bosh or Ray allen didnt save lebron but they did save the heat and they made the right plays when it truly counted just like you talk about that block against GS but it was kyrie that won the game with the 3pointer that would have won the game even if lebron didn't block that shot just by one point instead of three .The thing that kills me about lebron's fans is they never want to give anyone else any credit it's always about lebron who always have to have someone else close the deal at crunch time..,4년 전,0,
@ronaldjackson7541, @TheOnly-Semaj  yes that's fine point Last year it was AD that had to hit that big shot to win the game at GD it was kyrie who hit the winning shot and yes it was Ray allen that hit the big shot RIGHT after lebron missed the Same shot But I don't mind giving lebron credit for his part I just hate how lebron fans always want to give him all the credit and disrespect other great players..That's what kills me.,4년 전,0,
@costanostra2447, @ronaldjackson7541  The people who hate refuse to give credit to lebron for contributing in that game. Ray Allen and Bosh has always been given credit for those 2 crucial plays and I have no problem with that in fact I am happy that theyre being given recognition for their efforts. Anyway what im saying is there are unfortunately people that love to put down players’ legacies just because they were “saved” by a teammate and to me thats just sad.,4년 전(수정됨),0,
@ronaldjackson7541," @costanostra2447  What you are saying is the complete opposite of the truth in this case No one was hating on lebron people just want other great players to get their credit two What makes people mad is the controlled sports Media and lebron fans always always make everything about lebron instead of the team and a lot of times disrespecting other great players saying lebron carried the heat to two championships when he was the one that ran to play with Wade who already had a championship  then Ray allen who already had a championship you don't Carry players like Wade ,Bosh, kyrie  and Allen you play with great players like them that's what bothers the people I talk to.",4년 전,0,

@dcdenizen1275,"Irving's shot was truly amazing.  Consider the context: His team has come back from a 3-1 deficit in the NBA Finals to force a game 7 against a team that just achieved the best regular season record in NBA history. Game 7 is tied with a minute remaining, and Irving has the ball in his hands. He knows this is the most important possession of the game. He makes his move and raises up for a three over two-time NBA MVP Stephen Curry. It goes in. He puts his team up 92-89 with 53.0 seconds remaining.  That was one of the most clutch shots in NBA history. I never get tired of watching it.",5년 전,811,

If he didn’t foul out and have more minutes GS has a better chance of winning in 6. But also we have to make it go to 7 to get more money and attention to throw LeBron a bone. Game 7 Cle already has all momentum and they just let them have it. I will say, Cle genuinely played  their hearts out and the players may not have known they were being helped.

@Daveyboy_RS3,"First time I've watched this clip and realize LeBron didn't even make a field goal in the last 5 minutes. They were both stuck at 89 until Kyrie hit that 3. And KD was out. And he calls it the greatest championship win of all time. Yeah when the other team is best player is out and your Superstar sidekick makes the big bucket for you. As amazing as he is, I wouldn't want the ball in his hands with a minute left and the series on the line. No way. He's proven again and again that he's a finals failure. He missed a couple easy baskets in the last 5 minutes and almost missed that second free throw. Damn is he insecure. And that's why he has to claim and boast that he's the greatest of all time and that his 2016 and 2020 championships are the greatest championships of all time. What a despicable POS to make those claims disrespecting all the greats before him and all they accomplished in paving the way for him to be a superstar. Worst of all is when he paid to have Chris Bosh come to the Miami heat in 2011 cuz the organization didn't have enough to pay his salary, so LeBron went into his own pocket and covered it. A player paid multi-millions of dollars to bring an All-Star player over to his team therefore stacking the deck towards getting himself a ring. Like I said. Despicable. And they even dare mention his name and MJ in the same breath",4년 전,0,

@kenrickkahn,"Yep.. One of the greatest moments I had watching a game.. I went to KFC for some wings and I had to game showing on my phone watching it live until I got back home so when I ordered my food (I turned the phone over and black screen the phone) so she can hear my order correctly but at the same time I was hearing people in the background cheering in which I didn't think nothing of during the time.. So I pulled up to the second window cause it's late night and most restaurants would not take money from the first window.. so I approached the second Window and the lady says we are cooking your wings now, it may take 3 to 5 minutes and I said cool.. She was having a little conversation with me or whatever and I hear a dude and a girl say ""Did you see that??! Let's Go"" I didn't think nothing of it so I'm still running my mouth to this lady and I hear them say ""LEBRON JAMES FOR THE BLOCK"" and I'm like WHAT????! So I'm trying to see what the fuss is about and unblacked my phone and open up Sling TV and it loads slowly until it got back to ABC and I caught the Replays of it.. and I said loudly ""YEEEEESSSSS!!"" The lady asked Are you watching the game too?? and I said hell yeah! So I stayed there another 6 or 7 minutes talking until another customer pulled up.. It was one of the best nights of my life.. And this game made it worthwhile as well.. I will never forget it.. It felt so magical that it didn't feel like some thing normal but magical cause at least for once we were all happy about some thing and it felt good about something and celebrated because of it..  😊😥😊",4년 전(수정됨),0,

Trust me folks I watched Jordan I watched all of Jordan and I'm watching all of LeBron..  I've never seen anyone take over a game like LeBron James did in this game!! And that's what sets them apart for me.. If Michael Jordan was on that floor he wouldn't have been able to stop him!! As far as chips go you cannot judge the player by chips.. Of course Jordan had more look at the caliber of players Jordan had on his team.. I'm sorry I used to be one of them guys that said nobody will surpass Jordan LeBron's not going to be the guy but he IS THE GUY!! Anyone who denies it is just lying to theirselves they know it deep down they really do know it!! We are watching the greatest basketball player that has ever graced the Earth right now!!

I’ve never heard a place so dead silent in my life when this happened. Other than me and my dad cheering for this unrivaled accomplishment, everyone was quiet as could be. This mans always had the hardest road, always been the most scrutinized but through it all that’s what makes him the goat.

Also, to those that think this achievement by James (beating the 73 win Warriors) cemented his legacy as the greatest basketball player of all-time, you're out of your collective minds. Could you see Mike in a game 7, with 3:30 seconds left in the game and the game tied, miss a gimmie lay-up, (which James did) a gimmie 6 ft shot directly in front of the rim, (which James did) a slam dunk, (which James did) and then miss his first free throw with ten seconds left in the game only to barely rattle the second one home for his lone point in that span?

@skj_LDN_DXB, @scottb3034  how? They finished 73-9 ffs. They were great.,5년 전,0,
@scottb3034," @skj_LDN_DXB  Because they clearly were not a 73 win team. They were an extremely pale reflection of that in the playoffs. A true shadow of themselves. Everyone with eyes saw that leading into the Finals if not much earlier. They were a 64-65 win team that was seduced by the chance at history so they played harder than they should  have. This lead to injuries down the line and extreme fatigue. They should have eased into the playoffs by resting starters during the final 2 or 3 weeks by playing them a lot fewer minutes. Instead they won 73, curry got hurt and the rest of the team was exhausted to the point they almost lost MORE games in 25 playoff games than they did in 82 regular season games.   They were so bad in the WCF that if they didn't have a monumental choke job led by durant to aid them they'd likely have lost there. Then coupled with increased fatigue and the fact they were supposed to be up against the greatest player of his generation who finally had help, it should have been a cakewalk for the cavs.  The warriors are not a 73 win team in my book (yes i know the only thing that matters is the straight, unbiased, dispassionate numbers which said they were, but in my estimation they weren't a 73 win roster). They are a 65 win team that massively overachieved in pursuit of history and it cost them dearly. Even had they won the title in 7 games to the Cavs, the sheer amount of attrition suffered in the last 2 rounds precludes them from GOAT talk, which was the whole point of their desire to win 73. It is almost ironic and poetic.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

""Its over........Cleveland is a city of champions"". My dad screamed Yes! It was the first championship in his lifetime. The curse had existed as long as hed been alive. Hed seen everything. The drive, the fumble, the shot. I was alive for 97s world series choke.  He screamed it at the tv he kept screaming it over and over. Tears pouring down his cheeks. Its the one of the few times ive ever seen him cry. I tried to keep it together but then he hugged me. And i started🤣😂🤣😂. We watched the whole postgame. We didnt move. We were so overcome with happiness, exhaustion, relief. We feel asleep right on the couch. I will never forget that night.

@scottb3034, @uncledrew4825  It's only historic because the Cavs were horrible to start the series. You could have stuck a fork in the Warriors in the WCF...they were totally done by the finals but somehow managed to go up 3-1. The Cavs should have won this in 5 maybe 6. The Warriors and Kerr were complete idiots that were hellbent on chasing the record and it exhausted the team and exposed curry to injury which made the playoffs more of a slog which inevitably caught up to them in the end. Had they won 67-70 and rested the team and curry more they would have been more apt to play well in the playoffs and then the comeback would actually be historic.  But the Cavs put themselves down 3-1 to a team that was playing at 3/4 of its potential at that point and then overcame that exhausted team.

@burf4963," @AlexCole272 You're an idiot man. Google the Draymond incident and you'll see they changed the foul after the game, and that's only time it's every been done in NBA history.

Draymond getting suspended was planned and every sports analyst agrees the Warriors would have won that series of that didn't happen. Nobody wants the league dictating what happens in the playoffs, but they have preferences. Just look at the 2002 western conference finals between the Kings and the Lakers.

@AlexCole272," @burf4963  you right, the NBA did change it, but Green should've been suspended for the rest of the playoffs, because he was kicking players in the nuts on purpose, Green also hit James in the groin in game 4, and intentionally tried to hit him then jump on him, suppose to get suspended more games, if you ask me, the league gave him a slap on the wrist. FYI, idgaf on what ifs, cause the same can be said for a lot of finals, what would've been the outcome when GAME 7 Lakers vs Boston 2010 if Kobe didn't intentionally go under Perkins? What would've been the outcome if Love and Irving didn't get injured 2015 finals? What if the ref called a foul on Jordan last shot against the Jazz? The same can be said last finals with KD and Klay injuries. The fact is, Lebron stepped up to the challenge and came back, stop hating on him trying to provide excuses for the warriors. You're the idiot trying to downplay what this Cavs team did.",5년 전,0,
@burf4963," @AlexCole272  You're missing the point. I can handle what ifs and know they work both ways. If KD and Klay hasn't of gotten injuries in 2019 the Dubs probably win. In 2015 if Kevin Love and Irving were playing there's a good chance the Cavs win that series. But what I can't accept is when the league purposely changes a guy's foul to suspend him. Draymond is definitely a headcase and needs to learn how to keep his cool, but LeBronda purposely stepped over him and his foul didn't get upgraded after the game. I can't deny the Cavs played well in games 5,6, & 7 and the Warriors played like ass. That's not the point though. It's about the league influencing what happens to get more revenue by extending the series. Your can't tell me that it's a coincidence Draymond needed one more flagrant to be suspended and then the first and only time in NBA history a foul gets changed after a game. None of the what if moments you mentioned involve the league tipping the balance. They're just things that are part of the game.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@Jesko_VRS,"In the past, many have made the conclusion that His Airness, Michael Jordan is the greatest NBA player of all time due to many, many reasons. For one, he won 6 championships- won in two three-peats: from 1991 to 1993 and, from 1996 to 1998. And while Bill Russell owns the record for most championships won as a player, we have to consider the fact that Russell’s era was simpler compared how the NBA was when Michael Jordan came into the picture. We all thought that MJ being the GOAT was already settled. And not. In fact, it’s one debate in the NBA that will never end and will never be settled. Especially now that LeBron James recently said that his 2016 championship victory over some super team cemented his status as the GOAT. Okay. Let’s put it this way: beating a favored team from a 1-3 deficit might be the greatest comeback the NBA has seen but no, it doesn’t make a player the GOAT. And no matter how die-hard LeBron fans try to debate it, their idol isn’t the GOAT and will never be one.  Ugly Finals Record  3-6. Let’s be realistic here: calling yourself the GOAT with that horrible record in the NBA Finals will make you a fool. As a matter of fact, LeBron James got swept twice in the Finals. The first one was against the San Antonio Spurs in 2007 and the second one? Against the Golden State Warriors in 2018. And yet, he’s the GOAT? Really?  He’s full of himself  One great achievement doesn’t make one a GOAT in any sports in general. In fact, most NBA legends of the past have their own choices of their GOAT and it’s not themselves. But LeBron James? His 2016 victory, coupled by an injury to Andrew Bogut and a Game 5 suspension to Draymond Green, was what made him the GOAT. And the fact that he has gotten his head coaches fired in the past? Well, is that your GOAT, folks?  He will never be the GOAT  He can stuff the stat sheet every game. He can break every breakable record he could break. He could win more championships in the future but no matter what he does, he will never be the NBA’s greatest player of all time. Why? For the simplest reason: that GOAT label has already been taken. And frankly, even some NBA legends don’t think that LeBron James will ever be the GOAT",5년 전,0,

The whole league is jealous and waiting to see you fall because you’re unstoppable..Get hurt in the first round after murdering the rockets.. come back from injury too early cuz your team can’t be the Trail Blazers without you and drop 40 off the bench while playing at 60% healthy...Come back from 3-1 down against the Kevin Durant thunder...while being injured...To face a Lebron Cavs Team you just beat by 40 in January and they’ve been resting for 2 weeks bcuz of the sorry eastern conference... then right when you’re about to eliminate them all hell breaks lose NBA helps them by suspending Draymond...Harrison Barnes goes 4-30 in 3 important games... the game Draymond gets suspended jr Smith happens to fall into Andrew Boguts knee and he’s out the series...Iggy has a bad back... And Mr. Unanimous is playing at about 60%- 70% healthy and is falsely fouled out of game 6 and ejected... And the Cavs barely win in the last few minutes of game 7 off a Kyrie 3 being guarded by an injured Steph...Then win the next 2 finals with the 7 foot monstar and because you’re so great ppl that don’t know basketball live in that one 2016 moment When every former and current player was waiting to see you fall when you weren’t even healthy lol.. Steph Curry you’re the real goat... Your team couldn’t beat the Trail Blazers without you and then you almost beat the Commissioner the refs Lebron Kyrie K. Love at 70% while Harrison Barnes shot 4-30 over 3 pivotal games.without bogut..with a hurt iggy while being the Only ball handler before KD after going 73-9 a season you broke every record and when you sat out against the Mavs your team loss...

Went above 50, 40, 90 And He’s percentage from beyond 30 was better than Westbrook 2 pointers lol..Was literally unstoppable and everyone pretending like he wasn’t injured is ridiculous... he came back way too early cuz he’s “great” Team was struggling with the Trail Blazers..They Just beat KD lol",5년 전(수정됨),0,

I think Lebron is overrated and Steph is Undefeated...

@camdog23624,Robert Lee Lebron is probably the most hyped up athlete of all time (from HS) and has still passed all expectations. To even be in the same conversation with MJ is insane. Curry is great but hasn’t done it long enough to be considered in the goat conversation,5년 전,0,

@ryoung8891,"Camdog23 Lebron was legit in high school... I rooted for him in the 07 Finals but let’s be real if he spent his career on the West like Kobe he’s not going to 8 straight Finals unless he’s jumping teams from the Spurs to the Lakers but leading his own team in the West no way he dominates that era with the Spurs, Lakers, Mavs, Phoenix, Etc... Lebron is great but I gotta keep it real...Since 2010 if his team is starts losing he either leaves the team or changes the roster... for example 2014-2015 he goes back to Cavs and their below .500  in January like 19-20 record... he gets a major trade brings in JR, Shumpert and Mosgov and they start winning then everyone praises him lol it’s ridiculous... He literally is not supposed to lose if he can just change the roster",5년 전,0,
@camdog23624,Robert Lee He left the Cavs the first time because they weren’t going to add anyone to help him win. He left the heat because he wanted to go back to his hometown and help them win a title. He left the Cavs because he accomplished all he could and left to a bad Lakers team. Literally all of the teams he joined were bad before and became championship level teams by adding him. Going to 8 straight finals is amazing in any conference regardless of how bad the conference is some years. I guarantee no one else will go to 8 straight anytime soon.,5년 전,0,

Yeah he sucks as a person but this isn't Amare Stoudemire or Tyson Chandler we are talking about. He was arguably a top 15-20 player.  And Stockton...only one of the most prolific steal and assistmen in NBA history. And usually considered the best point guard after Magic and Big O....maybe after Isiah too. Not to mention an all-time great coach.....THe same team that completely decimated the Rockets, Spurs, Sonics and Lakers that had the likes of Admiral, Duncan, Shaq, Kobe, Payton, Kemp, Hakeem, Barkley, etc...  Discounting the Jazz is a mistake. that's all.",5년 전,0,
@scottb3034," @bob22270  THe 96 bulls are the greatest team ever. They have a higher win% than Warriors and had a higher ELO peak among other things than this Warriors team. Plus they won their Finals. So by that token Jordan is greater than Lebron on that alone if everything else was even and it isn't since Jordan has more titles, more Finals MVPs, higher PPG, more DPOY, more SPG, etc.  Lebron had a cakewalk to the finals in the East for 8 years propped up by having Wade a top 50 player, Bosh, Kevin Love and Irving. The east was routinely considered much weaker until recently when the Warriors had broken down and lo and behold James moves west with the rise of the Bucks, Sixers and Raptors.   NFL is noted for way more parity while the NBA is routinely scrutinized for its playoff lack of parity. Compare the champions of the MLB, Hockey and NFL vs the NBA since the 50s and you will see why. Terry Bradshaw made 4 SB in 5 years but isn't close to the GOAT and that's the best span a QB has had in the NFL ever and he WON all those, not just made 4.  Karl Malone top 15 player of all-time....like 3rd in pts. Stockton was first in assists and steals ever at one point....and jerry sloan top 10 coach ever.  Curry is a product of the league. Miller and Allen could have arguably have been as good if the NBA had this style of play in the 90s and 00s. WHo knows about Steve Kerr as well who was the most efficient 3 pt shooter in history. Point is that it is hard to make claims about Curry or Klay like that. Same way it is hard to say Wilt or Russell or Hayes were the greatest big men ever because the league was way different than the 80s and 90s when Hakeem and Admiral reigned...or the 00s during shaq's time.  there are a plethora of players viable for goat but James has less of a stake for it than Kareem, MJ or Magic imo.",5년 전,0,

They did that before LeBron joined Miami!). The other reason is because they just love to hate greatness, they’ll find anything and EVERYTHING.. they nitpick every little thing and complain about it. Which is such a shame tbh!   Life is short as the event of losing Kobe this past weekend. We need to appreciate GREATNESS while they are still alive and playing basketball. Kobe has taught all of us to respect, praise, and celebrate other players’ achievements, talent, and GREATNESS. LeBron is also a ONCE IN A LIFETIME player and ppl need to respect his love for basketball and what he also did for the game. Just like how the other GREATS did before him because once he retires and god forbid something happens to him in the future. We’re fortunate to see his GREATNESS and all the great moments or to some heartbreak of defeat that he gave us in his basketball career. All these debates and foolish/petty arguments is invalid more then ever. There will always be heirs to GREATNESS and once LeBron passes down the torch, it will be to a player HE KNOWS will carry the NBA and basketball with pride, passion, humbleness, and inspiration just like Magic, Jordan, and Kobe did for him when he was growing up and throughout his career continued to inspire and challenge him.",5년 전(수정됨),1,

@schuylersavage276,"jriden I think people such as lebron who just happen to( and also work extremely hard to) live the most amazing lives and achieve amazing feats feel as though there must be someone up there on their side for life to be so amazing.  Whether it’s true or not, I think it’s a sign of humility.  Like, lebron, as much  as he believes in himself, can’t fathom that the only reason he has the life he has is all his doing.  And I appreciate that.  I mean who knows what the truth is but part of it is obviously that lebron was born with an amazing set of genes as well as a mind that, with the right tutelage, could comprehend and achieve amazing things.  I don’t have a problem with him or anyone else wanting to thank God for their successes though.  I mean who knows man.  Maybe it’s just something that we can’t fathom with the human mind.  Things such as world hunger.  Perhaps there is a reason for it that just doesn’t make sense to us.  Idk and neither do you",5년 전,4,

@Six_Four_InA_64, @yoshixed244  Man Kobe was probably hated more than almost any player ever . But he only played the tail end of his career in the social media age when everything you say or do can be rewatched in an instant or when every picture is turned into a meme. And by the end of his career even his haters started to appreciate him more . I assume the Lebron haters will start to appreciate him more as well once he starts showing signs of slowing down,5년 전,2,

The city of Cleveland has never won a championship on any major sports team in this 53 year time period. The Golden State Warriors also had the best regular season record in history, and were up 3-1 in the finals. At that point, no team had ever come back from that kind of deficit.   But despite all odds, Cleveland found a way to win, thus ending the 53 year drought and Lebron James kep his promise of leading them to a championship.

Just a couple years later, Curry has one of the most historic seasons ever on a historic team and Kobe is retired. Just four years before that, Curry was injured with ankle problems and his career was in question.

As much as the media tried to make it as some kind of miracle, Cavaliers begun the 2015-2016 as clear cut favorites for the title, being the only super team in the league. The fact that GSW far exceeded the expectations behind Currys' insane regular season, didnt change anything. Cavs were still way more stacked and well rested from coming out of the most putrid conference ever, whilst GSW barely got past the OKC. It was a disgrace finding themselves down 3-1 and it was only by a collection of the most outreagous coincidences, including league interference, that they made it only by the thinnest of margins in the end and of course it was Kyrie who made the shot.",6년 전,28,

@jakerojas5888, @mskidi  numbers mean little.  The warriors dominated bro. You probably gave the Cavs no shot to win.  A 25 ppg career scorer scores 52 points in a 7 game series.   Draymond scores more than Klay and Steph combined in game 7.  2016 Cavs wasn't a super team. On paper or 2k.  But it was a champion team,5년 전,6,
@mskidi," @jakerojas5888  Lebron scored less than Jason Terry in the 2011 Finals. So the Heat werent a super team cause he choked. The 2016 Cavs were the only super team in the NBA. Not in terms of overall performance, they were underperforming consistently, but in terms of pure talent. Absolutely stacked to the point where you couldnt double any of the 5 on the court. Lets be real now. Curry had to create and score getting roughed up by the whole god damn Cavs defense, whilst nobody else could create for himself (including off the ball scorer Klay). In the meantime Lebron had the luxury of resting on defense cause he was going up against brick man Barnes and offensively he was taking turns with Kyrie and at times JR (who brought them up from down 10 in game 7). The fact that had it not been for injuries and Greens' suspension, Warriors would have won, speaks more of Cavs dysfanctionality than anything else.",5년 전,1,

@vince3139," IamGrandMagus  im a big curry fan but he's not a one on one player. as a matter of fact, any decent long and athletic wing defender can shut down curry one on one in a late game situation. i think its kind of unfair for us to expect curry to just go get the ball and go to work one on one like a lebron or kd can. dude is 6'3 with short arms and very limited explosiveness. other than his handles he doesn't have the strength or quick first step to gain separation. theres this huge narrative about curry underperforming in the playoffs/finals and the reason why is because in the playoffs game gets slower with higher defensive intensity and whistles get tight. curry is not able to get out on the break or play off the ball because all the pulling shoving grabbing just about anything goes in these playoffs. curry gets held by shump on damn near every play off the ball. you might say well why can't he run some pick and rolls? he did, and the warriors got an open corner 3 on every pick and roll he runs because he gets trapped off every single pick. mind you curry is the first player to receive that kinda defensive attention on EVERY PICK, long before lillard, harden, trae young etc etc. the clippers were the first time to do that to him in the first round of the 2014 playoffs. before then, no one, i repeat no one has gotten that kinda defensive attention because you are essentially giving up and open lane for the roll man or an open look from the corner after rotation. WELL this didn't work for the warriors because draymond has 0 scoring ability and harrison barnes couldnt throw the ball into the ocean in that series.  these are not excuses, these are facts. they are also why curry isn't in the goat conversation and lebron is. nobody is saying curry is better than bron. curry maximized his potential and lebron didn't. he's too scared of missing the last shot and taking the blame. its like once the ball is off his hands he's off the hook because he made the ""right play"" regardless of the shot goes in or not. in a late situation i think most teams rather have someone like danny green shumpert or jr shoot an open shot than lebron putting his head down taking his 260 lbs of pure muscle and bully his way to the hoop, get a lay up or get fouled or even pull up from the elbow if the lane gets clogged. but he too SCARED. it's not like kyrie is getting easy shots down the stretch either. but he has the balls to take and make tough shots and live with the results.",4년 전,0,

@terrillt426,​ @vince3139  lebron has the most game winning shots in playoff history and he has the 2nd most in regular season.  That's actual and factual.  Not sure where you got the other information but it's not true.  I'm a Jordan guy by the way think he's the best I've seen.  However think lebron is the most criticize basketball player ever.  People  reach to discredit him. Most of us if they had his accolades you couldn't tell us nothing.   He surely maximized his potential.  The pressure weight and expectations on a kid in high school most would buckle under that.  There are plenty of freak athletes that have come and gone aren't remotely close to lebron.  Kemp Carter Harold Miner McGrady.  Players with similar builds like Haslem David west Xavier McDaniel again not remotely close.  To say lebron didn't maximize his potential is wild.  He is one of one only cat to score 40k points 10 nba finals?  Think of how many Carmelo anthony played in?  And how close Melo came to 40k points who was an elite scorer played same exact era as lebron.    Lebron has dominated in nba finals like no one else.  Lead both teams in every thing basically points rebounds assist blocks and steals through a whole series.  No other player has ever done that.  Think that is the essence of maximizing and exceeding expectations.   And I'd say his finals loses are blown out of proportion.  4 of the. Loses any other great like Jordan even would have loss  4. If you put Jordan at age 22 on the cavs in the finals he is getting merked.   If Jordan Loss his 2nd and 3rd best. Player right before the finals.  So take pippen and Rodman off and he played the fully healthy jazz he is getting destroyed.   The other 2 if Jordan had to play a team in the finals that had 2 mvps in their prime with plus 2 more perennial all stars.  That's like jazz add Reggie Miller and Olajuwon to Karl Malone and John Stockton everyone's in their Prime.  Jordan isn't wining that.  Pacers took them 7 with far less.  Jordan could have easily been 2 and 4 in the finals with those same circumstances.   A lot of basketball winning is circumstantial who you're playing with coaching the culture and who you are playing against and of course injuries.  Just some food for thought.,1년 전(수정됨),0,

@maceomillions2192,FIU Student That Mavs team also swept the Kobe lead Lakers team that year they beat the Heat lmaooo. Also never forget that Shaq won finals MVP over Kobe 3x. I bet you can't explain that though... & I said that the Bulls wouldn't have 3 peated the 2nd time. They didn't need Rodman the 1st time but they did NEED him the 2nd time. I watched MJs 2nd 3 peat live so I know a lil about what I'm talking about.,6년 전,7,
@maceomillions2192,FIU Student Also Kobe had an allstar in Gasol & a really good Bynum not to mention the best coach who ever lived in Phil Jackson... What great coach has LeBron ever had? I'll wait.,6년 전,3,
@vulcanraven9701," @maceomillions2192  I did mention kobe had gasol, but he also did defeat San Antonio when Duncan, manu and parker were young. when heat played them 2 of those guys were certainly not as good as when they faced black mamba before",6년 전,3,
@maceomillions2192,FIU Student So do you think Kobe is an overall better player talent wise than LeBron?,6년 전,6,
@vulcanraven9701," @maceomillions2192  well kobe is easier to build team around for sure. to build around lbj team can only play 1 system. Most of the passing has to revolve around him, there needs be 3&D players, a suuperstar scorer teammate (Wade, kyrie, AD) and another guy who can give a good 18ppg or more (klove bosh kuzma), the former 2 can play down low while latter couldd hit 3s. Team also needs alot of veterans, which is why each team lbj goes to, it becomes filled w/bunch of Veterans + talented players and there is no ""process"" to it. Kobes the one I'd draft.",5년 전,1,
@maceomillions2192,"FIU Student While I don't agree with your pick of Kobe over LeBron, I do like the way you broke all of that down though bro. That's a good analyst of your perspective 💯💯💯 The only problem with Kobe was he didn't come into the league ready. It took him like 4-5 years before he became the Mamba. LBJ came out the gate swinging & was NBA ready... Just imagine if LBJ had Shaq/Phil Jackson for as many years as Kobe did. 3 rings would have probably been 4 or 5.",5년 전,3,

@vulcanraven9701,"Laker Nation : No, you cant just make that argument. Bunch of players could've got more rings using ""what if"" scenarios. If Shaq/kobe stayed together theyd win more. Mj coulda had more rings if he played in 94' as rockets had just 1 superstar. Had Pippen not got hurt last 2 gms in series vs DET that could be 8 rings",5년 전,0,
@donnyjones6717," @dagod6361  With context MJ had faced way better competition in the east. When they're an 8th seed they was getting eliminated by legit HOF TEAMS.When the bulls broke out they finally did it against the pistons who in  turn had beat the celtics who was fighting for nba supremacy mainly with the lakers when it came to the finals (cause you cant forget about the sixers,bucks,pistons) and also SCOTTIE and Horace finally got ready and beat the pistons. And no the Bulls never beat the celtics the pistons beat the celtics won 2 straight became the POWERHOUSE and then the bulls beat them and they became a dynasty. I'm not saying no great players arent needed to win a chip obviously they do but there's a way in how you do it. Old school mentality work with what you got cause I want to beat you.New school mentality let's form like vultron to take out our enemies. Both are effective but since were in a new age it's a different set of rules. And yes before joining the celtics k.love was getting 30 and 30 (more like 26 and around 13)and was a multiple time all star. When he went with lebron he was still avg a double double around 17 pts and 10 rbs. 16 and around 10 in 2016 and even now hes still avg a double double. So if that's not a 3rd star IDK what is you could make an argument that klove was better than c bosh when it comes to who was lebron's better 3rd star. It's close and they do both have their moments but I do have to give the nudge to klove but that's a different story for a different day.",5년 전,0,

This team, in the greatest of “Rocky” spirits, showing incredible heart, refusing to give up, and against all odds, made NBA history for all time. And LeBron, who got to do it playing for his hometown, was a huge part of what made it happen. He did give it all he had, and left it all on the court. Still tears me up a little 😢😉👍",6년 전(수정됨),4,

This championship win had so much impact around the league, it had so much meaning, lifting the Cleveland sports curse and seeing Lebron fulfill a promise he made to that city... you can't write a better sports story. Cavs came in as the underdog. They had to face a team that many considered unbeatable. A team that broke the single season wins record with 73 wins and single digit losses over an 82 game season. Sure, the Cavs got gifted a Draymond Green suspension. But the Cavs won 2 in a row with Draymond back including a game 7 in the Oracle. They won 3 in a row, 2 of which were on the road. Only team to come back while being down 3-1 in the finals. Unbelievable finish and I never would've expected it. I thought the series was over after game 2.",6년 전,1,

No body can blame Dray for them losing that game because look at this stat line, 47 mins played, 32pts,15rebs,9assists on 11/15 shooting, 6/8 from 3pt range and 4/4 ft's, he was amazing on the floor that night. I had to pull up this stat line to show people out there who sleep on his game that he can be a scorer if he is locked in on any given night. He is a very special player and if the dubs do overcome these injuries somehow, he will be the mvp of the series. Dray is the engine that makes them go. He is the heart and soul of that team. No doubt about it. Cleveland proved that by taking advantage of him not being there for gm 5 and changing the momentum of the series. #Dray2019finalsmvp",6년 전,0,

@jackhammer111,"what the hell is LeBron doing burning shot clock in a tie game at 1:30 left? Tries to bully his way to the basket and misses a 5 jump hook and Iguodala hardly jumps to contest, then flat foots his way up court where GS immediately miss a shot. Now, this next thing I say is the history of Lebron in the end of playoff games. After running the floor for the block he was gassed. The reason he dribbled down the play clock on that play was that he was gassed. the reason he missed the shot was because he was gassed and the reason why after the GS miss Lebon just started walking back up court forcing Clevland to call time out, is because Lebron was gassed. In this whole 3 1/2 minutes, the only thing he contributed was that blocked shot. Cleveland defense had nothing to do with GS missed open three's. It's on GS for missing but everyone knows how fricking rare it is for GS not to finish. Lebron gets his lucky charm ring. It will be his last. GS comes back and spanks his ass 8 games to 1 in the next two playoffs. In 4 consecutive finals, GS is 16-5 against Cleve and the not GOAT.     I know what it's like to be a fan of a player that screws up in big games. I'll call Dennis Eckersley the greatest closer I ever saw despite that on dumb back door slider he threw to Kirk Gibson in the world series. So if Lebron fans like him because they just love watching him play I'm good with that. But you are not nearly greatest of all time with a 3-6 playoff record and so many of them lost because he could not fulfill the clutch role he put himself in. I think Steph is the highest impact player ever. He hits the clutch shots and the stake in the heart threes in all 3 of his championship years. He's 3 out of 4, James is 3 out of 9. That is a hideous difference. Notice the 3. He has the same number of rings. Get it. Even if GS loses to Toronto I'm still going to think Steph is the most thrilling and most fun player to watch I've ever seen. GS lost game 1. Toronto got bounces and made their out of control shots and GS didn't. The series might come down to which team can make the most out of control shots. Nobody is better than Steph at that, and he has a flair for the dramatic. He'll feed other players, like he did feeding clay Thompson when clay broke steps record for 3's in a game, make them better, enjoy playing with them, won't scowl at them on court if the screw up and he'll always be looking for a way to be more creative and do something nobody's done. Lebron once scored 7 three's in a game. Steph has done seven or better 16 times. Let's not forget Clay Thompson who goes on streaks, 11 in playoff game once, 9 two times (steph 9 twice also) and there there is the straw that stirs the drink, Draymond Green.   Many players are more GOAT than lebron. Wilt without a doubt is the GOAT. Then Bill Russel, Then there is Karrem,  Jordan, Magic, KD. Lebron's six losses stick out like a sore thumb",6년 전,0,

I'm sure he had a little pain, but nothing like what he's acting like. He knows that they just won the Championship and all he has to do is make a free throw. He knows that even if he misses both, it's still very unlikely they tie the game. He knows it's pretty much over and that the entire World is watching him on the ground right now. He's probably thinking that he should pretend to be really injured just to milk out some more sympathy and make it look like something big. He's thinking ""I did it, we won. Imma lay here for a little while and have my whole team come and try to motivate me. The whole world is watching and when I finally do get up adnmake this free throw to clinch the Championship, everyone is going t see how I did it with a hurt wrist and how I was beaten and gave everything.""

@MitchBloodGreen," @Nate102793  Watch the play again... LeBron was waiting to rotate over to defend the basket if Curry got by the perimeter of the defense. There is no way he gets a layup in that situation. If anything, it would have been a drive-and-kick, the ball would've rotated and the Cavs would've made sure anyone other than Klay and Steph were shooting (as they had done the majority of 2nd half of the series).     Love's job was to stay in front of Steph on the perimeter and to not allow a 3-pointer. His job was not to try to stay with Curry all the way to the basket if that's what he chose. That's why you have defensive rotations. Love did his job extremely well. Actually, that is about as good a job as a player can do, especially a big man in space on the perimeter.

@davidvalsechi9582,"They did the impossible against the BEST Regular Season team in NBA History with a 73-9 record, having NOT lost back 2 back games in a year and a half! Being down 3-1 in this series and having to win 3 games in a row with the last two being away at Oracle. So to beat the Warriors 3 games in a row which no team was able to beat GSW 2 games in a row and No Team ever has come back from 3-1 series deficit in the Finals ever. The probability of them winning the Chip after game 4 was .0001% against this Warrior team. And you gotta thank Klay Thompson for this Championship! Because his comments about Lebron after they beat Cleveland in Game 4 saying “This is a Man’s Game” and “I guess he (Lebron) got his feelings hurt!” Even I remember feeling and saying “Your waking a sleeping Giant and just throwing fuel on the Fire for him”. And when they spoke to Lebron about Klays comments he laughed and was SO annoyed by it but only said “Its so hard to be the Bigger man and take the High Road” but you can see in his demeanor that he was fuming and body was filled with adrenaline! Lebrons response was 40pts with Kyrie also putting up 40pts in Game 5. And putting another much needed 40pts up in Game 6 also to push it to a Game 7. And once it’s Game 7, the entire 6 games leading up doesn’t matter. It just became a 48 minute Game of wills and hunger over which team wants it more than the other. We’ll never again see in our life time a Team in the Finals down 3-1 comeback and win it. There’s a reason why they were the 1st and only team to ever do it in Finals history. Even the playoffs, coming back from down 3-1 only happened 11 times including this series and previous series where the Warriors were down 3-1 to OKC and came back to win. So before these playoffs it only happened 9 times out of over 300+ times in series. This will always be the Greatest Finals ever and the 4 consecutive years that Golden State faces Cleveland in the Finals will always be Known as the years of the Warriors vs. the King 👑 Lebron James. And for me personally this 2016 Championship means more than the 3 Championships the Warriors won over Cleveland. It was a 4 year term of the Best Team in History vs. the Best Player in History. Which people will argue over his Finals Record. But remember, he played against these Warriors 4 times, the Spurs 3 times, OKC once and Dallas once. So he played against Juggernauts his whole career, the only blemish I hold against him on his Legacy is his 1st year with Miami where they where up 2-1 on Dallas Mavs and then they sh!t the bed losing 4-2. When they should have won this series and being the easiest opponent he has played against out of all 9 Finals appearances. Well they made up for it the next year beating OKC with Durant, Westbrook and Harden in a gentleman's sweep 4-1. If anything we would have thought at the time it would have been the other way around where they beat Dallas and lost to OKC. Bottom line is he shouldn't have lost to the Mavs. I believe it was the only Finals that his Team was the Favorite going in while all 8 other Finals his Team was always the underdog. So if he would have just beat the Mavs and everything else stayed the same he would have the perfect Legacy and a lot more people would agree that he is the best player that ever played the game. Well, at least in my opinion that is?",6년 전,0,

@adu11,"Can we all be honest about something here: ppl define superteam as, 3 or more all stars teaming up to win a ring rather than the organic development of a team to elite status. However that definition - conveniently - overlooks said teams record the following season(s) and said individuals actual production when either playing alongside their co-stars or solely w/ role players. This popular definition is used in the nba lexicon only to degrade the accomplishments of Lebron James and no one else as the same standard isn't applied to Kevin Durant or the Celtics orginal Big 3. My point is without this popular narrative, looked at objectively in a vacuum lets say 50 years from now, the data will show that Lebron carried a far greater burden than either Curry, KD or any of the Celtics and its being generous to downright disingenuous to label either his heat or cavs as superteams when defining based off record, number of all stars, finals production of co-stars etc. So everyone on here could say whoever saved Lebron's career or he needed to make superteams to win but the data doesn't lie and when all of you grow old and all these ridiculous narratives stop circulating, future fans of the sport will look at the fact that a 73-9 team couldn't beat a team featuring one serial all star and went and signed a multiple time scoring champ and regular MVP contender to beat them.

This game would’ve went into overtime if it wasn’t for Kyrie winning the series and giving Cleveland the rings/championship when he hit a ugly un-makable 3pt shot in Steph’s face but yeah let’s make it seem LBJ was the sole reason why they won because of a block he made which means shit all because iguadala blocked his shot.

@TheChurchofCacti,"LeBron needed Kyrie to save him. As a Laker fan I wonder what the team would look like if they kept Dlo, Randle, Zubac, and still had the cap space for a max player like PG13. Then this summer they'd be likely to land Kawhi with that team, at which time they trade Randle, Russell, Ingram for AD. New lineup for 2020 would be Ball, PG13, Kawhi, AD, Zubac.  Magic screwd up royally. With all those #2 picks on cheap deals, he had sooo many options. Giving away Dlo, Randle, and Zubac shouldn't have been an option. Zubac and AD would guard the paint against anyone",6년 전,0,

The reason I disagree is because if you go faster then you run the risk of the Warriors getting into the fast break and the Warriors are a very dangerous team on the break. But if you slow it down, it takes more time off the clock which is less time that the Warriors have to work with and again that’s important because of their explosive offense. So I think the Cavaliers did the right thing by slowing it down and eating time",6년 전,1,

This year ' finals have been refreshing only because the Warriors talent has been injured and it evened the talent discrepency a bit.

Cleveland had a possession where James missed a short jump hook against Andre which hit the front of the rim. Warriors have a possession where Curry missed a three point shot badly. Cleveland has a possession where Kyrie hits a big shot to put them up. Warriors have a possession where Curry misses an in and out three Cleveland has a possession where James missed a free throw after being fouled and landing on his wrist, hits the second freethrow.  But they always show that block as in a presumed context of the game being tied, the clock is under 30 seconds when the Warriors are going for the lead and James blocks it!

Seriously, if it weren't for those two moves, the Cavs probably would've got one more ring in these last two shots and LeBron would still be there.  Instead, he was stuck in a 1 v 5 situation twice, yet his haters trash him, despite the fact that he had no help the last two years, ESPECIALLY last year.

I was only alive for the LeBron teams, the awful seasons the Browns had, and the chokejobs from the Indians in the postseason, but my dad had been witness of all the horrible luck to Cleveland, to the point that he thought we’d never win something. My grandpa died a month before this game, and he was the most loyal Cleveland sports fan I have ever known. No matter how bad a team played, or how much he hated how they sucked, he watched every minute of every Browns game, every inning of Indians ball, and almost every minute of Cavalier basketball. When LeBron hit the free throw, and my family was jumping around, because we knew they finally ended the curse, the first thing I thought of, was that my grandpa was up in heaven smiling, because they won, or cracking a joke that they couldn’t let him be alive for the title. This will forever be my favorite NBA Game and moment ever. The finals after this were absolute garbage because Kevin Durant ruined the league, and Kyrie became a prima donna, so this would be my “series finale” of the NBA, the underdogs toppled the evil empire with all odds against them, so millions of people could rejoice.",6년 전,494,

@williamalex6991, @MilesAway-mw4xp  You're miscalculating，Correctly is 24 to 23 seconds is one second……And so on，17 to 16 seconds is eighth second。So 16 to 15 seconds is already the ninth second period。You can try this calculate。By the way，you can play a few 2K，every game is violation in 16 seconds.this is the most accurate.and completely simulate NBA rules.,6년 전(수정됨),0,
@MilesAway-mw4xp,"No, because the clock starts at 24, the clock transitions to 23 when the time is 23.9, to 22 at 22.9 and so on. So the clock transitions to 16 at 16.9 seconds, do when the clock hits 15, when it the time hits 15.9, then the eight second violation should be called, not at the 16th second where he would only use 7. something seconds",6년 전,0,
@williamalex6991, @MilesAway-mw4xp  You're wrong again， 23.9 seconds doesn't show 23 seconds directly.There's a second in transition.Have you seen the game？So that's why one second later still surplus 0.x seconds，24 seconds won't immediately change to 23 seconds，There's a second transition.，You just need to watch the game.,6년 전,0,

@williamalex6991, @MilesAway-mw4xp  Yeah，So the truth of this rule is that 16 seconds is an eight seconds violation。But there are artificial errors in real games。Different referees have different judgments。I have two videos to show you。Both videos are called violations at 17 seconds。 http://t.cn/EPhEqz9,6년 전(수정됨),0,

@Blue-no4jt,"The most legendary finals performance ever. MJ can have his 6 championships, Kobe can have his 5. This one meant more to Lebron and the city of Cleveland than all of those put together. The number of things that had to go right for them to get this win is unreal. They were down 1-3 against the greatest team of all time, the defending champion who had just beaten them, a team that won 73 games in the regular season and dominated the post-season. For it to come down to 89-89 in the fourth quarter of game 7 when no one on either team could hit a shot, 52 years since the last time Cleveland won a championship, 7 years after Lebron left. But had Lebron never left, the Cavs would have never been a lottery team in time to draft Kyrie, and Kyrie would have never had a chance to develop into a star. If the Cavs hadn't started the season so poorly, they never would have fired David Blatt in favor of Tyronne Lue, who was actually a worse coach. But if he had hadn't been the head coach, who knows if Blatt would have had the gall and simplicity to call a basic switch and have his point guard iso one on one against a defensively improved Steph Curry, while completely nullifying the greatest playmaker/player in the world in Lebron from the most important offensive possession of every singe Cavalier's career. Then if Cleveland never traded for Love, he never would have been there to shut out the most unguardable point guard on the planet for the final minute, even though he had been one of the worst defenders in the NBA all season up to that point, and had barely contributed anything to the series thus far. But had he not been so bad defensively, the Warriors wouldn't have thought to switch their best offensive player onto him not once but twice in the final minutes to make something happen. And had Lue been a better coach, maybe he would have made a change, maybe not even leave Love in. And if Lebron hadn't been born in Cleveland, if he hadn't fallen in love with the least lovable city in America, would he have poured his soul into that chasedown block that was less than a millisecond away from being a made shot? Would he have jumped the highest he's ever jumped in his career and almost kill himself on that final dunk attempt leading to the game-winning free throw? This was the most improbable championship of all time, yet it felt like destiny. It's why we love this game.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@henny4825,"​ @23rubs  You can try to act like LeBron was laying bricks and that somehow defined his whole finals performance, but Lebron also had one of only three triple doubles in NBA Finals history, why the fuck is you tryna act like just because he bricked he didn't get one of the most clutch blocks of all time. LeBron isn't the best player of all time, but he is clutch enough to lead his team to the finals and come back from a 3-1 deficit, which has never been done before. Also, this was against Steph Curry in his PRIME, he had just come off of a UNANIMOUS MVP SELECTION. There are no excuses to say this wasn't one of the greatest finals performances of all time. Not only that, for the whole Finals LeBron and Kyrie together were averaging a combined 53 POINTS A GAME. Kevin Love barely played a role in the 2016 finals when it came to on ball productivity, his usage rate was only at 12 percent. Klay, Steph, and Draymond combined only outplayed them by a combined average of 60 points per game WITH OVER 60 PERCENT OF THEIR TEAM'S USAGE RATE, and that's with Draymond averaging a double double, not only was his defensive presence massive, it was the absolute core of preventing the cavs from winning, and he still lost that finals. Not only that, LeBron averaged the best defensive stats of the entire finals with 2.6 steals and 2.3 blocks a game, in comparison to the big three of the warriors at the time adding up to average only 2.3 blocks and 3.6 steals a night, COMBINED. You might act like people are riding LeBron's dick, but when you look at the stats he deserved this ring and it really is worth more than a stacked superteam that couldn't even show up in the finals. And also, saying that Miami is even comparable to the warriors is just plain bullshit, not only do the warriors have one of the best two-way players in the league in Klay Thompson, they also have a defensive player of the year and easily the greatest three point shooter of all time, who just so happened to revolutionize the way basketball is played. KD got carried to the finals, LeBron carried his team to the finals.",6년 전,0,

Durant replied back with “Ugh, fine fucking hoe, im coming for the free ring, only if you get a good center.” Kevin then buys United Airlines Economy tickets. 1 year later, wins a ring. 2 years later, Draymond finally gets the man KD wanted, Demarcus “Boogerhead” Cousins. 6 years later, the Warriors win 11 rings with a team that has superstars such as Jimmy Butler, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and their new GM is LEBron jamesss.",6년 전,1,

@crossingborders4826,"Nothing short of amazing. What a season for basketball. Had so many great memories from this season, just to name some; all star dunk contest was insane and had been heavily criticised in previous years, Kobe’s retirement tour was fun to watch and his his final game wow, this champion warriors team broke a winning season record spearheaded by the first ever unanimous MVP and the best and most entertaining shooter the league has ever seen (don’t even try to negate the man of his ability to score inside WITH EITHER HAND or his dribbling/passing/IQ - he is even a good on ball defender) and it took such a well organised cavs team to come back from 1-3 down which we know had never been done before, both teams TIED ON POINTS SCORED AFTER THE FIRST 6 GAMES, lead by in mine and manies the greatest to ever bounce a bball who lead the 5 main statistical categories FOR ALL PLAYERS ON BOTH TEAMS as well as becoming only the third ever to triple double in a game 7 finals on his way to pick up another finals mvp and more importantly a franchise first championship AND even more importantly an entire cities first sports championship in 52 years. You can’t script it better than that. Moving forward everyone keeps dissing KD and now boogie and I can appreciate why but I think we have to look at the big picture here, the warriors in 2018/2019 and beyond are going to force the rest of the league to become better, they are going to show future generations how hard it is to win and us fans are going to be the winners down the line seeing how different this game is played. I think there are two players in modern bball who will forever change the way players play and that is lebron and Steph, two who are so well rounded and EFFICIENT, but at the same time, we wouldn’t have lebron without MJ and we wouldn’t have Steph without his dad Dell. There’s always light at the end of the tunnel, watch this league and players get better and better every year. It won’t be as good as 2016 for a long time because the 2015/2016 season will prove later on to have change the NBA for good. It takes another perfect season to change the way is game played, don’t hold your breath just watch and enjoy while it is in front of you✌🏼",6년 전,0,

@conorjones339," @troubleman6466  It didn't have any huge story lines though besides people saying the rivalry has returned which really wasn't true. Like Kobe already won his ring without Shaq and basically everyone on both teams was already a champion, Meanwhile the Cavs were trying to do something for a city that hadn't done anything in sports in forever, pretty hard to top that especially when they were facing the greatest regular season team ever. Both finals were great, but this one had all the story lines and the most improbable comeback in finals history. And Im not sure if I just don't remember anything, but I cant think of one signature play from the 2010 finals, like I know World Peace hit a three in the last minutes or something, but nothing that is going to be remembered forever.",6년 전(수정됨),61,

@reneep9972," @RyanKWilliamson  Exactly right. The title of this video should read ""Final 3:39 of the biggest fix in NBA history"".  And that's saying something after the league gift wrapped the 2010 Game 7 in Staples for LA.  They simply weren't going to have a repeat of 1969 when all those Hollywood snobs went home sad.  Titles were stolen from both Boston (2010) and to a slightly lesser extent Golden State (2016).  After this ""game"" it makes it harder for me to take the NBA seriously.  They HAD to get Lebron a title in Cleveland no matter what.  Hang on to that moment Cleveland fans of any sport.  It'll be another 50 years before any team from that sewer wins another title.

@reneep9972," @troubleman6466  Well, the first 6 games were great between LA and Boston.  But did you really think the powers that be were going to let the Celtics win Game 7 in the Staples Center in front of all the Hollywood liberal elites?  Zero chance.  If any Boston Celtic even came into contact with one of the SHADOWS of a Laker player in the 4th quarter of Game 7, it was a foul.  Kobe and Gasol could literally throw a player from Boston to the floor and stomp on his face and the foul would've been on Boston.  I was always a very proud Laker fan until that game 7 but I felt like I had been raped after we ""won"".  It was so dirty and ever since I have no team to root for.",6년 전,3,

@reneep9972," @jjjjrrrr4353  The more you shoot, the more you score. Pretty simple. I'll take guys like Magic and Bird who'll score less but get every other player involved and better them. Why do you think nobody wanted to go play with Kobe and nobody will want to go play with Lebron? Because he dominates the ball, gets all the glory when his team wins and places the blame on everyone else when his team loses.  Yeah, he went to 8 straight Finals in the pathetic East after Boston got old. In the West, he's gone to zero straight playoffs and even had he stayed healthy all year, would've been about a 6 seed and bounced in the first round. I'll go ahead and say what most people think but are too afraid to say. Had Lebron played his entire career in the West, he'd have as many championships as Barkley, Dominique and Dan Marino combined. Zip, zero, nada. He's great but he's not as great as the media makes him out to be.  Somewhere between 6th and 10th greatest ever.  And for the lying son of a bitch who claimed to be a Celtics fan in this thread but also thinks Lebron is the ""GOAT"", you're either a teenager who never saw the true legends play the game or you're not actually a Celtics fan but rather a Lebron fan trying to up his status by claiming to be a Celtics fan but saying Lebron is the GOAT.  Let me guess, you're also a Patriots fan who thinks Peyton Manning is the best QB ever and a Red Sox fan who thinks Jeter is the greatest player ever.

@dognutts,"YESSSS!!!!! God still to this day I can’t believe the Cavs won. I was born and raised in Cleveland Ohio and rooted for the Cavs before these finals and I root for them still till this day. This is one of those games that you remember exactly where you were at, I was at my grandmas house and my eyes were glued to the tv while I sat in front of it on the floor . I remember being so nervous and scared that the Cavs were going to lose again because when they lost in 2015 I was devastated so I knew this year we had to win. I and everyone else watching witnessed history live, but as someone who actually is from Cleveland and suffered the lost throughout the years, seeing them finally win our first championship in any sport since 1964 was amazing. I remember the block, the shot, Kevin Loves defense on Curry, LeBron’s free throw and the sound of the buzzer going off better than the back of my hand. When LeBron had that iconic block on Iguodala I screamed of joy and when Kyrie hit that game winning 3 I started to celebrate but I was still terrified, until we were up by 4 points with 10.6 seconds left of the game. The Warriors had the ball with 10.6 seconds left of the the game and Cleveland was up by 4 it was at that moment I knew the Cavs won their first ever NBA championship. The Cavs were the underdogs and they were going against a 73-9 team, no one thought they could’ve came back from a 3-1 lead but as a Cavs fan I knew that the could do it and I believed in them. This game was more than just basketball. This game was history, the first team in NBA history to comeback from a 3-1 lead in the finals, the Cavs first ever NBA championship, Cleveland’s first championship in 52 years and it was the best night of my life. I remember when the clock ran out and the buzzer went off I started to celebrate and jump around, I poured water and beer on me just because how happy I was and I didn’t know what to do. I ran outside and and started to celebrate in my grandmas front yard with the neighbors while fireworks were in the background. I remember the day after I had to check my phone and see if the Cavs actually won and I was so happy that it wasn’t a dream. To me as a Cavs fan this made LeBron the Goat, he did something no one else ever did. He came back after 4 years and told Ohio that he was going to give us a championship and he sure did. This game made me respect LeBron as a player and person forever and he will always be the GOAT in my eyes. When LeBron left Cleveland in 2018 I wasn’t mad because he gave us a championship like he said he was going to do. In fact when LeBron left I was a big LeBron fan by then and I told my self wherever LeBron goes I go and rooted for him ever since despite he’s not on Cleveland anymore. When Kyrie left Cleveland in 2017 I wasn’t mad because I was great full for what he did for the Cavs and the city and state of Cleveland, Ohio. I also have too much respect for Kyrie and I root for him and his team to this day. Kevin Love is amazing and I will always support him as well. Also I have to thank the Warriors for choking and blowing a 3-1 lead, seriously I really appreciate that. And in wise words of LeBron James “CLEVELAND THIS IS FOR YOU!”",2년 전,0,

@jorgevinanova3619,"every chance in hell in fact, and here's why....  firstly this is not the ""most infamous curse in sports history"" there are many more significant from football and other sports, its probably not even the most significant one in America, Basketball maybe...but thats only really big in one country and not even the biggest sport in US, that title belongs to American football.  its the English top flight - way more popular that the NBA globally, way richer... and its ran for far far longer than the NBA  Its football... the worlds biggest, richest, and by far most popular sport (and even if you dont like it as a sport by every measurement its the Worlds game)...when they won the title, they made world headlines, no one heard about Cavaliers win outside US as it wasn't that big news.  it was won by a team that at the start of the season were 5000/1 to win the title FIVE THOUSAND thats unheard of odds yet they did it over a 38 game season against giants of team like Man Utd, Arsenal, Liverpool...huge teams heard off the World over, (who knows about Golden State or Cavaliers outside of US realistically? not many unless they are specific fans from other countries) and with no draft system or salary cap to help them...all teams have a much closer chance of winning in US sports as they are obsessed with making it as even as possible for all teams so with that in mind...how can this be so historic if its in the leagues interests to make it a level playing field?   Yes Cleveland did well to win...but Leicester were literally no hopers with a budget about a tenth that of Man Utd, Chelsea, Liverpool and yet they actually won it, and with no comparable le bron james type star players, they were most analysts pick to get relegated, Cleveland cant get relegated as there is no punishment for failure in US sports just reward the next year with a high draft pick.   The EPL is the most prestigious domestic sports tournament on the planet, comparing the two is impossible one was a historic upset and sent shock waves through the sporting world, the other was about an already established superstar player going to his home town (admittedly playing fantastic and lifting his team) and winning a national title which created headlines in America, nothing more (and I hate Leicester, that title win was an awful season for me to witness, but credit where credit is due, they were nothing short of sensational that year)  NOT A SHOT BRO? as I've just clearly demonstrated...EVERY SHOT BRO  ;)",6년 전,0,

I like some of the Warriors (Steph, Klay, Livingston) but KD on their team eliminates any opportunity of them getting a champion with this much actual meaning behind it. This was won through hard work and mental strength  Two things that transcend well beyond sports. GSW will never be a legit dynasty in majority of the public’s eyes. This is simply because they took the adversity and competition away from the actual competition. Not only did the 2nd best player in the world, KD, join the best team in the world, 73 win GSWs team, but he joined them after he was beaten by them. Not was he beaten by them, but he was beaten by them when KD was up 3-1. KD and OKC were one game away from being in the finals again. But he sold out to the team that beat him. He was known and loved for his humble mentality and ability to play. Now he went full heel. Making all kinds of heel moves. No respect at all.

@swburton316,"... Lebron is playing in a higher-scoring, less-defensive era that also has 7-game series in every round of the playoffs, whereas MJ played in a lower-scoring era where teams played much tougher defense and shot less threes, and when there were actually real centers in the paint... and the first round didn't even go 7 games. MJ is a better scorer... and it's not even up for debate. That is a fucking laughable assertion. Literally retarded. The ""better rebounder"" argument -- Lebron is bigger, and he's playing in a league that has virtually eliminated the true center. The ""better facilitator"" argument -- clearly didn't watch MJ. He was hardly ever tasked with being a facilitator. When he was (when Paxson got hurt, e.g.), he was a triple-double machine. Lebron lovers either (a) are too young to know that, or (b) just conveniently leave that part out of their arguments because it doesn't fit their agenda. MJ was a superior scorer.... and a FAR superior competitor. You can't even talk about Lebron in the same category there.   This is why I can do nothing but look down upon you condescendingly... because you literally have no fucking idea what you're talking about. It is so blatantly obvious that you've only watched Lebron, and never watched MJ in his prime. Fucking foolish dude. You want to talk about ""not respecting me on an intellectual level?""

@rudymanglona9329,"Chris W okay Chris, first off all. You’re way too mad lmao chill. Now, sure the defense isn’t as tough as before. That’s true. Jordan is a better finisher at the rim also true but Lebron is the better scorer. Hey can score from everywhere and every position. Lebron can play every position. Lebron is bigger faster stronger and has overall the better stats than Jordan. Not to mention the fact that the game has evolved. People are stronger, faster, and smarter than ever because of science advancing in preparation and overall training of the body and the game itself. To deny most of what I said is to lie. Some can be skewed by opinion sure but for the most part everything I’ve said is fact. Also keep in mind that Lebron is more clutch than Jordan. He has more game winners and more buzzer beaters. Sure MJ has more rings but Lebron has more finals appearances, and he won more playoff series. Sure Jordan had his triple double moments. Guess who has more career triple doubles though.....LEBRON! Oh also guess what, Lebron isn’t done yet. Every year Lebron is breaking Jordan’s records. People complain that he’s only doing that because he’s been in the league playing at a high level for so long. Well guess what, that just adds to my point on why he’s better. Since the moment he came into the league, one more time, SINCE THE MOMENT HE CAME INTO THE LEAGUE, the franchises he’s been on has gotten better and made it to the finals because of him. I think people mistaken the GOAT conversation with the most legendary conversation. MJ is way more legendary than Lebron but a better basketball player? Nope. So read carefully, my next statement will consist of straight facts. As I said, Lebron is a better scorer because he has more playoff points than MJ all while taking less shots and he’s still going. And he’s a better play maker, passer, rebounder, and he’s stronger faster and bigger than Jordan. Oh did I mention he’s still going. These are my points to why Lebron is a better player than Jordan.

Today's game has (1) no true centers protecting the rim, (2) no hand checking/INFINITELY less physicality, and (3) a MUCH higher focus on offense/less concern about defense. I mean the bad boy pistons are open about the fact that the only way they could stop MJ was to straight beat the shit out of him. It'd be a cake walk for him in today's game. Lebron can't even shoot free throws LOL!!!!!!!!!  MJ was a far superior scorer, and if you can't see that, well, you simply didn't watch him play. That's become pretty obvious at this point though. Lebron comes out to win, sure... MJ came out to win... and also demoralize you. Straight kill you. And he sure as fuck never ROLLED OVER AND DIED IN THE DAMN FINALS. And he damn sure wasn't going to get out-played by a past-his-prime role player like Jason Terry in the Finals while losing the series to a lesser opponent. And Lebron can't do it without another all star. MJ's offensive skill set was just plain better. Footwork, the whole 9 yards. Lol... fundamentally, Lebron isn't even in the discussion with MJ. Literally the whole argument for Lebron over MJ is that he's bigger and faster and stronger (although stronger is absolutely opinion -- Jordan was strong as fuck). That's the extent of the argument. And as far as who the better competitor is, Lebron simply isn't even in the discussion. And to boot, MJ did it against better competition. Lebron is NOT more clutch than Jordan (I legitimately laughed at that ridiculous statement). Lebron wasn't even the most clutch player ON HIS FUCKING TEAM when Kyrie was there. There were entire last possessions where Lebron wouldn't even touch the ball because it'd be in Kyrie's hands to win or lose. That absolute crock of bullshit is the last straw bro. You've flat out been demoralized and brutalized in this argument. Such blatant ignorance. Kids in China have been honor killed for being less egregious family embarrassments.  You don't get to leave out the details to suit your agenda. Sure, LBJ has more playoff points..... BUT, against lesser competition, in a TOTALLY different era. You're jaded by the fact that you've never really seen MJ play. And that's fine. But you've vomited some straight up nonsense into your keyboard lol.

HOWEVER -- to say that, you also MUST, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, acknowledge the fact that the Mavs were worse than any team Jordan ever played in the finals, and you MUST, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, acknowledge the fact that Jordan's road to the finals year in and year out vs. Lebron's road to the finals year in and year out simply are not in the same category.",7년 전,0,
@rudymanglona9329,"Chris W you’re desperate to win this argument by stating your point and saying it’s over. Im going to ask again, give me a list to why MJ is better than Jordan. What you’re doing is attacking teams and accomplishments. Let’s attack overall skill because that is what we’re talking about. Who’s a better basketball player. There’s a couple point I’ll give you. 1 the game is less physical. But they spend more time playing actual basketball and less time fighting. This league is way more advanced than before. Better offensively as you said, and overall a smarter league. It’s a new era, one advanced through scientific preparations. PER is at an all tile high and a couple years back the record for most players averaging 20ppg in a season was broken. If you think Jordan is putting up better numbers than Lebron in this league you’re foolish. Another thing I’ll give you is the Mavs. Bron should’ve won that no excuse. Mavs, 6 rings, the league today is weak, seems to be the go to comments of an MJ fan. However when comes down to actually compare them skill for skill, you MJ fans ignore that completely which I don’t understand. Y’all have the utmost confidence in MJ but yet can’t go a good debate about who’s better without insults. And I agree a lot of Lebron fans do this but that’s usually the idiots who follow him blindly. I truly believe he’s the GOAT because numbers prove it. For the record when I was a Lebron hater, even when the Mavs won, I bet on the Mavs. However I watched Lebron grow since than and became a fan. Now if you’re willing to debate the two, skill for skill, who’s the best basketball player of the two, I’m down. If you don’t want, feel free to think you’ve won and don’t reply.",7년 전,0,
@rudymanglona9329,"Chris W a few things I didn’t mention but will because you went there. 1996 final a shorter smaller slower injured Gary Payton put Jordan on clamps keeping him at 36% from the field and 10% at the three. MJ needed his teammates to close out that series. MJ never had to face the a team like the GSW because they were the GSW before GSW was even a thing. They were the dynasty. Sure MJ played a big part but Phil Jackson play a big part? Scottie, Paxton? Shall I continue? That whole team was stacked. Let’s not act like MJ could carry a team by himself to the finals cause we’ve seen very clearly he couldn’t. If his team was less than great he’d flop. Lebron brought a team of lames to the finals more than once. Lebron did that, not his coach or anyone else.",7년 전,0,
@swburton316,"It's not a BETTER league -- it's a DIFFERENT league. PER is higher today all-around not because guys are better... but because less focus is put on defense, the 3pt shot is far more used, etc. Much more focus on offense today. You keep trying to justify what you're saying using basic stats that are completely void of context. Idiots like Nick Wright and Skip and Shannon use stats because that's the only way they can justify their opinion as someone who's never actually played the game. That isn't intellectually honest. Competition in the 90's was FAR, FAR superior all-around. Today you only have a handful of good teams.   I really don't need to justify it at this point, but hell...  -Jordan was a superior scorer. At this point, this isn't even an issue of content even with people who say Lebron is a better all-around player. I think Lebron's game is more well-rounded... not because MJ couldn't have been as well-rounded, but because of how he chose to play the game. But MJ is a superior scorer. Period. That's not even an issue I'm willing to debate, because to say otherwise is indefensibly wrong. What, 10 scoring titles to like 1...? In a superior defensive league? That actually had true big men in the paint? While expending more energy on the other end of the floor by actually playing defense himself? And while those defending him could actually be physical?   Jordan was a superior defender. Again - really not even up for debate. Big part of that is a function of the fact that damn near nobody plays hard defense anymore anyway. But the accolades speak for themselves between the two. And all this talk about Lebron being a better defender because he can ""defend all 5 positions"" is straight up retarded. The only reason he can defend all 5 positions is because the true point guard has totally changed (now a PG is more of a SG too) and the true 5 has virtually disappeared from the game. In today's game, Lebron can surely handle his own on the block (although his footwork offensively and defensively on the block is mediocre at best...because it's never had to be good for him to be successful due to athletic ability). But in the 90's, if you think Lebron could've guarded the 5 spot with true 5's like Shaq or Hakeem or Ewing or Robinson backing him down....? Homie you are on CRACK. By the same logic used in the first bullet re: MJ being able to be more well-rounded if he wanted to, I'm positive that if Lebron played in that era, or if he truly wanted to, he's 100% capable of playing thank kind of tough defense.   -Jordan was a superior competitor. Again, this really isn't even up for debate. Lebron just isn't that straight up killer like MJ or Kobe. I think he's a smarter all-around player than those two, but killer? Not even close. Lebron wants to win. MJ wanted to kill you. He was addicted to not only winning, but demoralizing the competition. There is no discussion as far as who was a superior competitive.   Jordan did it against superior competition. No - he didn't have to get through a 73-win team (because he was on the team running the show like that). BUT -- all-around, the competition was more well-rounded and just plain better then. The east was stacked. Lebron gets to cake walk to the finals every year through who? The Pacers? Bro.... I'm a Pacers fan. Born and raised in Indy. Reggie was my fucking childhood idol and MJ was a thorn in my side. I watched them go at it over and over again. I watched the battles with the Knicks. Today's playoffs don't hold a fuckin candle to those back in the day. Not at all. To say otherwise is laughable. I'll be the first to say that Jordan never beat a team as good as the Warriors in the finals... but if we're going that direction, we also have to acknowledge the fact that he also never lost to a team as bad as the Mavs... and the fact that Lebron's route to the finals has never been anywhere near what Jordan's was year in and year out. No fuckin' chance Lebron has ever had to go through a team like Shaq and Penny's Magic in conference playoffs....   -Jordan did it with less help. Pippen was a great player. Without MJ though, his legacy wouldn't be what it is today. That's just the damn truth. MJ never had more than one more all-star on the roster with him. Lebron has had multiple all-stars on the roster with him on multiple occasions (not this year......lol). In MJ's 6 championships, the ones in 1991 and 1998... he was the only all-star on the roster. Lebron has played with over 2x more all-stars in total (meaning if Lebron played with DWade 4 years, counting it as 4) than Jordan did. In 2 of Lebron's championships, he was one of 3 all-stars on the roster. He's lost multiple finals as one of 3 all-stars on the roster. I'll say that this is the closest of my arguments because MJ had some great role players like Rodman on his teams, but Lebron has had more all-stars by a long shot. And he's had probably the greatest 3pt shooter in NBA history on his roster (who bailed out their team after Lebron's missed 3 in the playoffs...). You could make a case for Reggie or Drazen because those guys actually had to work to get open for his shots unlike Allen who was more of a spot shooter, and because a guy like Reggie was his team's #1 guy, so he was stuck with the best defender, but if I had to have one guy to make a 3, it would be Ray Allen, and most people wouldn't disagree with that. Not even a Pacers fan like me lol.  -MJ was more clutch. Goes back to killer instinct. At the end of the game, MJ was going to have the ball. Period. 50% on game tying/go-ahead shots inside of 24 seconds remaining. You literally cannot make the argument that Lebron was more clutch. At all. For a while, he wasn't even the most clutch player ON HIS TEAM, let alone in the NBA, or in NBA HISTORY ffs.... Kyrie would often be the one with the ball on the last possession and Lebron wouldn't even touch it. Why? Because Kyrie was more clutch. Lebron has made the ""right play"" in the clutch (passing) just as MJ did to Kerr, etc. But Lebron has also been bailed out by Kyrie, Ray Allen (missed shot, rebound gets kicked to Allen who saves game).   -MJ never carried the stigma of ""disappearing"" in the 4th quarter. It's almost unfathomable to call someone the GOAT who literally has spent MULTIPLE YEARS OF HIS CAREER getting lambasted for disappearing in the 4th quarter as Lebron's career has seen. Speaking of disappearing, MJ also never got out-played through an entire finals series by a past-his-prime role player like Jason Terry...   I could continue on from the viewpoint of someone who's spent hours and hours watching both, something it's become very clear that a huge number of Lebron>Jordan'ers are too young to say. I think Lebron is right there in the discussion with the best players of all time. He'd be on my all-time starting 5 without question. I'm not trying to trash the dude. He's probably my 2nd or 3rd favorite player in the NBA right now. I thoroughly enjoy watching him. I respect the hell out of what he's done on and off the court. He's super intelligent in both respects. He's a tremendous role model (something Jordan can't exactly claim lol). And he's one of the best to ever lace them up.  ... but he ain't MJ. I rest my case.",7년 전,0,

@bbqblazekyleg7551,Chris W First the game where Jordan scored 63 went to double OT so he did play an additional 10 min but let me not try to say what he did wasn't impressive because no other player in history has passed him but that was also in the first round and his team was about to get swept which they did but it wasn't Jordans fault since he actually tried everything he could that series to beat the Celtics but couldn't get it done. Lebron lost finals game where his team would have won game 1 if not for his teammates doing boneheaded things and just like Jordan he tried his best except in game 4 because it was over he couldn't get it done. It's very impressive on the points Jordan averaged In the finals but Lebron has also averaged over 34 points or near in 3 of his finals with almost 9 or more assist or near 10 or more rebounds while being a pass first player which is really impressive since he is a pass first player while Jordan is a shoot first player but to be fair Jordan wasn't put in the same position as Lebron since Jordan had Pippen to do the playmaking and rebounding so Jordan could do his greatness which is scoring and defending at an all time great level.,7년 전,1,
@swburton316,"63 pts in 58 mins = 1.08ppm. 51 in 48 mins = 1.06ppm.   MJ's stat line for that series: 43.7 points, 6.3 reb, 5.7 ast, 2.3 stl, 1.3 blk  ...despite only playing like 3/4 of game 3.  On top of it, MJ did it against a great defensive team (BOS 3rd in the NBA in 85-86 in pts allowed) in a far-superior defensive era. Lebron did it against an all-time great OFFENSIVE team, but a mediocre-at-best defensive team in an era that has already ditched focusing on defense (GSW 18th in the NBA in pts allowed this past season).  Either way, you want to talk about 2 greats on 2 respective teams that gave them a big old pile of dog shit for help?! How about averaging damn near 44 points a game and getting swept.... 2nd best player on that team was orlando woolridge. I'll give you youngin's a minute to google him........ lol  Not trying to bash Lebron. IMO he's the 2nd best all time. And even better, he does it all while being a phenomenal role model both on and off the court. Sets a fantastic example for kids. Sure, maybe could've handled stuff like ""The Decision"" with a little more grace, but on the flip side, he's not out smoking cigars and drinking and partying and gambling.... I have nothing against Lebron. Not trying to bash him at all. But that doesn't mean I'm not going to call somebody out when they make a blatantly ignorant statement about ""let's see somebody else put up 51 and lose...""",7년 전,1,
@swburton316,"also, people forget that pippen, while a great player, would have nowhere near the legacy he has today without michael jordan. Pippen wasn't an all-star when that bulls team won their first championship. Nor was he an all-star when they won their 6th. People talk about Pippen so much, and I'm not saying he's a slouch by any means... but Isaiah Thomas is 100% correct. Top 50 of all time? With Jordan -- he probably still shouldn't have been. Without Jordan? Not a chance in hell. I mean people just forget that the man was out there crying on an NBA court because he couldn't win without Jordan. Went to a stacked blazers team and went home with no jewelry. He was a damn good defender. He and MJ would fuckin dawg guys on the floor. But he's over-hyped.

When he returned they won like 3 finals in a row. Lebron is an outstanding athlete don't get me wrong and will be labeled as one of the greatest of all time, but Jordan has never lost a Final he played in, and literally. There is obvious proof that the Bulls were nothing without Jordan. Jordan didn't need any great teammates. As long as he had a shooter (which he did John Paxson and Steve Kerr) The Bulls were amazing just because of Jordan. Of course, this era of basketball is completely different from the era that Jordan played in, so you can't really compare. But just watching how the Bulls played with Jordan made everyone believe he is the GOAT of basketball, and arguably sports history. Just remember the Bulls had the worst seasons ever when Jordan first retired, and they won 3 in a row when he returned.",7년 전,0,

@kevincoffer2934,"Hate to lift your ""worship LeBron James at all costs"" shades, but Jordan had a competitive spirit unlike ANY we had ever seen before. Sorry, but when you take a sport to a professional level like these 2 men did, it's all about competitiveness. Not letting your physical advantages over pretty much everyone you played guide you to victory. Not relying on the refs' calls or no-calls to get you free points. Not playing an individual game, as opposed to a team game, by standing in the backcourt like a buffoon after getting some lame dunk that anyone his size could do, rather than hustling back on defense. LeBron is not even CLOSE to the level of Jordan, and that's a fact. He's probably the softest 6'8"", 250 pound guy you will ever see. And you're seriously gonna talk about REFS? Like the refs don't favor LeBron as well? I'm sorry, but that is ABSOLUTE bullshit. Save it for the dicksucking session. Have you seen all the travels and shitty flops that went his way? Jordan would never do that, not even in today's game. It's just a level that a man like him would never stoop to. And LeBron isn't exactly what I'd like to call a ""role model."" He is cocky, definitely not as cocky as MJ, but cocky enough to make me steer clear of modeling any part of my life after him. Also, you're talking like literally the only thing a team needs to be successful is LeBron. Last time I checked, LeBron didn't do so well until he ""took his talents to south beach,"" and got paired with 2 NBA greats at the time. I wonder why that is. Put LeBron on a team with shitty teammates (not one with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love who both bailed him out numerous times, not one with Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, and even Ray Allen who bailed him out in that one finals series against the Spurs), and you get about the same result that Jordan got, early in each of their respective careers. I'm not at all saying LeBron isn't a great player, he's definitely one of the best we've ever seen, but to say that he's above Jordan is just insane.",7년 전,1,
@kevincoffer2934,"Utkarsh Dave Sahni it's so dumb how you just take raw stats and go from there without considering 1. how those stats were obtained and 2. how long it took to obtain those stats. and again, Jordan had a spirit unlike anything we've ever seen, and that doesn't show up on the stat sheet that you love. and honestly the competition was pretty good back then. the 80s/90s had among the best PGs, SGs, SFs, and Cs of all-time in Magic, Jordan, Bird, and Hakeem, as well as 3 of some of the best defenders of all-time in Rodman, Hakeem, and David Robinson. In fact, the best defensive player at each of the 5 positions all came in the 90s - Payton, Jordan, Pippen, Rodman, and Hakeem (arguably with Russell for the C position). No other era had as much depth or stacked level of competition on the team and individual levels.",7년 전(수정됨),1,
@kevincoffer2934,"Utkarsh Dave Sahni Russell Westbrook has been getting triple doubles nearly every game the past couple of seasons. Does that mean he's better than LeBron since LeBron hasn't done that? No, because his teammates let him grab rebounds and he yells at them if they don't shoot immediately after he passes it to them, and he jacks up a lot of bad shots to get his points.

@Jewety,"Steven Scummy Kd burner account,  really?  Why on earth would KD be watching the end of 2016 finals?  This lost has nothing to do with him. Unless that was supposed to be a joke? If so, dude yikes! Kevin Do-can't?  Yikes, gotta work on that material man.  Now, was his route significantly easier since joining them? Of course! But lets not act GSW winning was a sure thing before he got there. I mean in 2016 alone they were down  3-1 to the Thunder and actually lost in the finals. Not to mention, how the injury bug did help them in every single round in 2015. Great team, but definitely beatable. They needed KD just like he needed them. Anyhow, man they have worn the past two years, they deserve credit. I dont like what KD did, he did what gave him the best chance to win. Period. And they managed to do it twice, kudos for that. I'll be the first to admit that when it happened, I absolutely hated it, but people need to get over it. KD left two years ago and they've won both years. Thats doing something  regardless of if you approve.  Lastly, yeah KD was dealing with some acceptance and ego issues last year. Guy went from being most loved to most hated REAL QUICK! Some people get overwhelmed and feel like they have to defend themselves. What I can say is that I doubt he's doing that this year, guy generally looks like he could care less about others thoughts nowadays.",7년 전,0,
@Jewety,"Steven Scummy I wouldn't say overpowered, they definitely were gonna lose this year to the rockets in my eyes. Anyhow, that just means the other idk 29 teams need to change their strategies. If gsw is overpowered like you say, then every team should be built to beat them.  Its too bad teams are too concerned admiring or trying to be like them instead of trying to beat them. It's obvious their kryptonite is teams being physical with them. Has been for awhile.",7년 전,0,

@brent2394,"Lifelong NE Ohio Cleveland fan here. I was on vacation in Zion National Park when this game was on. I was in my hotel room glued to the screen, enjoying adult beverages the whole game while my wife napped from the hike we finished earlier. I told her when she woke up that if the Cavs won, I was going to sprint from our 2nd floor room at the Hampton Inn out to the pool, do a front flip into the pool while chanting ""Let's Go Cavs!"" When that buzzer struck zero, I shot out of the room like an overweight bullet. I fulfilled my promise, but the poolgoers weren't impressed. I only got one cheer from a young kid who knew what was up. Tough crowd. Must've been a bunch of Warriors fans, lol. I'll never forget that moment. Special time to be a CLE sports fan! Funny to think that at dinner the night before I came across a family of Warriors fans when out for dinner. They called me out with my Cavs hat. I told the guy, ""Mark my words, the Cavs will win by 4 tomorrow."" Never would I have thought that prediction would've came true, no joke! I hope he was thinking of our conversation from the night before when he was watching the final moments of the game. Just my little story from this game... Ohio native on a Western US vacation who had to watch game 7 of the finals in his Springdale, UT hotel room. I was in Colorado for the game 6 comeback to force a game 7. Was a great summer!

Also, LeBron hit the last shot(free throw sealing the game to 4), not Kyrie. LeBron nearly ended Draymonds life and if Draymond didnt foul him, that wouldve been more clutch than Kyries shot.

Rodman wasn't an all star, and Jordan never played with another Superstar.",7년 전,0,
@norcal5321,"You're exaggerating. Jordan played amazing teams. Sonics were 64-18, And had a deep ass bench, probably one of the best defensive teams ever, Had arguably the best 6'4 lockdown defender of all time in GP, and Jordan ended up with his worse finals appearance, which was the same as LBJ's mvp performance. Blazers had a deep squad too, along with the second best SG in the league, who everyone thought could dethrone MJ. They also had a plethora of three point shooters. Suns were even Deeper and Barkley is one of the best PF's to ever play, KJ was super athletic and could shoot, Marjle was the original Deep range dead eye and could defend very well. These teams were all 60 win teams.And to be little the JAzz, is complete bullshit, Stockton is the all time assist leader, is anyone close to him today not even, plus dead was solid in all categories. Malone was a MVP and another top 5 PF, Hornacek and B. Russell were both spot up shooters and good defenders. It's funny how you probably dont even know the teams those teams beat to  get to the finals, that Jazz team swept the fucking shaq-Kobe lakers, and D Robinson's spurs with pop. So, please do yourself a favor and put misinformation out there.

That's why this year when u get bounced u gonna run to Philly cause you  know they a serious threat now to your cake walk threw the East to the finals every year your a joke well we don't want your bitch asds cause Ben Simmons and embiid got something special and they got next with or without you .  We don't want an aging superstar to finish out maybe this last five to seven years? with a team that's got great chemistry don't try to come and fuck it up cause Philly fans (real fans) will give you the business not like them fake Cleveland fans who worship you cause your the only thing that's made them relevant in the sports world in the last what 100 years.. that sports city is a joke .sixers fans ain playen that come to our team and try to run shit you just another guy on that team cause Simmons and embiid at this point I would take over an aging superstar who always cries I need more help  cause they know basketball and they know a drama  queen when they see one  only AI Allen Iverson can do that but he's Allen iverson so what more do we need to say anyway lebron tighten up if u wanna join the boom squad which is the 76ers yeah I said it  ohh and  Jordan still the 🐐 but come to Philly and win a couple rings we might be having another conversation . PS I secretly really want LeBron to come to Philly lol Philly is where it's at right now in the sports world open up your eyes and we're going to stay relevant as we always to somehow unlike the worst fakest biggest bandwagon fans of all time CLEVELAND .

@TheArtsynaut,I always find it hard not to tear up watching LeBron fall down to his knees and cry because he finally won a championship for the Cavs. Last time I felt this attached to basketball is during the time the Lakers won championships with Kobe and Shaq. I know a lot of people are hating on LeBron but he's such an inspiration when it comes to achieving the impossible. Can't wait to see how the playoffs will be this year!,7년 전,0,

They have the 3 best shooters on their team arguably in nba history, plus every role player possible that works hard to make their lives easy, it’s totally different! Not even close actually surprised you don’t see the difference, lebron still had to do a lot on his own cu wade was injured he just felt more comfortable with wade there, and bosh was inconsistent a lot! But yeah I mean I don’t get it that would be like lebron going to golden state after he beat em in 2016 to join draymond klay steph ifuodola, and. A bunch of reliable role players!

You realize how hard it is to play injured some players never recover they are not the same player, you just a typical lebron hater and dumb af tbh! And plus lebron has issues with his owner and his teammates and the city was mad at him and he played it smart af he knew he wanted to win in Cleveland so he let them tank cuz right when he left they went from 60 wins to 19 wins Cleveland did the next year ya know? And yeah when mj left the bulls made the playoffs with pippin and went game 7 in second round and almost made it back to finals ya know? But anyways he played it smart cuz he knew he needed help he can’t take every shot so they tanked they got kyrie once he saw how good he was he saw his opportunity that’s why he only signed a 4 year deal with the heat cuz he knew he wanted to go back and win one for his hometown he played it great and they got better recruited love when he was good but not at his best and made a great nba story good for business, lebron actually came back Durant was just scared of losing again so he even said it he’s tired of being number 2 so he went to golden state so he can feel like he’s number 1 and now he trolls everyone saying he’s the best when really he’s just a bitch with a weak mentality!

Kd had adams, sabonis, Westbrook, Roberson, himself, waiters ( very underrated), Jeremy grant, Alex Abrines, Anthony morrow, dj August, Cameron Payne, Steve Novak, enes kantsr, ilyasova, randy foye, serge ibaka, collision, I mean dude that’s a fucking stacked team and you know it! How I see it is he gave up on himself, he gave up on the city the owner his term mates, and took the easy road to the 73-9 team that didn’t new him to win! If I was curry I would do the same thing like dude we just bullied this big dummy kd and now we wanna recruit him to come work hard for us so we can stack rings while this dumbass just does work and wins us rings! Thy knew he was mentally weak and they proved it by beating him miserably and then recruiting him to win for them! Lebron had a great relationship with wade and he just wanted to start fresh after all the hate he got but think about it he never had a great team in Cleveland, they were pretty good but not what Kobe or Jordan or Durant had, and the heat were really good but not great it was prettt much 1 on 1 basketball with wade a lebron just a couple more pieces! The warriors are too stacked so I agree he did kind of ruin the nba there were stacked teams you had Cleveland golden state, thunder, rockets, Boston, etc now it’s just golden state Houston and Cleveland! And Boston when they get healthy! And now people say Durant is the best like hell no dude is a cupcake he left a great team to go to the best team weak as hell!

@ltzp2,"Wade and Bosh don't compare to a team that already had a 70+ win season and a ring by themselves. Lebron going to Miami was more of an experiment, and the league was still incredibly competitive. If anything, there wasn't anyone who could match the spurs of 2012-2014 except for Lebron, and he did the league a favor by going to a team that was actually competitive. Again, the heat still lost have of the years Lebron was there. People where mostly mad that he left his home team, but Cleveland wasn't competing for a ring, and the front office wasn't going to do anything to change that. How can you blame someone as competitive as Lebron for not taking any more of that? What KD did was much worse, lets have an honest discussion where we acknowledge the obvious truth. There was never a year where any of Lebrons teams were stacked enough to just say ""this season is a wrap, no one stands a chance."" Can't you see why people hate there being a superteam that takes any element of suspense or mystery from the game? If Lebron had retired a couple of years ago, the league would be severely declining in viewership and fan interaction.

@mindphaserxy,"C'mon he didn't ruin a goddamn thing.  I am a lifelong Cavs fan and free agency is the nature of the business. I swear us Americans would be shocked at player movement in a sport like association football because it happens all the time. The players need control and the power, not the owners. When LBJ went to Miami and Dan Gilbert got all pissy I was shocked by his behavior.  Yes it was awful that LeBron left like that. How he gave up against the Celtics. But players moving to new teams is totally fine. C. Ronaldo has starred for Man United and Real Madrid and no one calls him a traitor. Sol Campbell totally jilted Tottenham when he signed with Arsenal but it was his move to make.  The point is Durant going to Golden State isn't ruining anything.  Other teams have salary caps and trades and draft picks too.   If a player wants to do what's best for them I can't fault them for that. LeBron went to Miami and won 2 championships.  That's not tarnishing his legacy at all.",7년 전,0,

I remember seeing that on Twitter that night and talking about it with the people that study this. And then the last minute and so they rigged it for Cleveland to give them the victory at the end. There not going to rig it for one side only and make it obvious or the NBA would be out of business because people would stop watching. They make have to make it look like it's bad foul calls but in reality they contorlling everything with the offcaiting making it look real. The NBA is atrocious on that. No league rigs the amount of plays and possession in a sport than the NBA. Not even college. They are dugesting human beings. Also they in the illumanti as well as why they do all this stuff.

@pizzapickup,"My favourite player in the league is Steph curry and has been for years. It was so hard to watch this final series especially game 7 (ofc), and absolutely crushed me when Cleveland won. I have completely avoided this footage For the years since because it always bring back the memories of the team that had it all and lost it all. But in that time my love of nba and of great players has only grown continuously, and by that my love and respect for Lebron James. He’s by far one of the most talented and respectful players ever to grace the game and I’ve grown to respect him so much. As it stands I hope for yet another gsw vs cavs finals because these teams are so talented and elite. Steph, Steve and more have created a dynasty and lbj defines strength and persistence. My two favourite players in the league are now tied as Steph and LBJ(where previously lbj was 2nd) they are the hardest workers and leaders. My top ten is accumulated of players like Kd, Cousins, Kyrie, Draymond, Klay, Howard, Westbrook and more. My favourite jersey is my 2016 finals Kyrie, that clutch three will zenith his career and our hearts for years. Ps.s I hope LBJ goes to the warriors hahaha he’s 3-7 in his finals series and deserves to win as much as possible before his time comes. It may break the nba by some peoples standards, maybe people just need to work harder and be better then they were yesterday. #ballislife",7년 전,0,

@DigitalAscensionArt,People see that Lebron IS the greatest athlete to ever play basketball and get confused thinking he is the greatest basketball player to ever play. There is a difference.   I respect Lebron's game to a point. The limit starts after the 3rd quarter ends. He has a lot of showing and proving to do to get 4th quarter respect. There are so many better 4th quarter players in history including Kyrie that deserve that respecognition!,7년 전,0,

@97Andras,"The fact that it is a matter of debate who the real GOAT is, says more than anything about Lebron James. He is SO good, that it makes people uncertain if MJ still is the best to ever play the game. Now thats what proves that LBJ is the greatest of all times. Well, more precisely, I think that MJ and Lebron are the 2 greatest. They can't really be compared to one another because they both have brought something different to the court. But something unique, something that no one ever has. Lebron is the greatest leader, the greatest at the rim, the greatest overall player. He's presence on the court brings fear into the opposing team's heart, they know, that they can lose even if they lead by 25. Lebron brings out the best of his teammates on the court, they become a better shooter, a better defender, their game IQ rises. He passes the ball a lot, thats why his score avarage is worse than Jordan's. If he was just as selfish as Mj was, he could score 50points per game in his prime and I think also now he could do similar.. period. he can't be stopped at the rim he is a fine shooter and further more he still improves. His 3 point stats are the best so far this year. Ladies and Gentlemen Lebron James still gets better at the age of 33. And one more thing. His coaches ALWAYS SUCKED, MJ had the best coaches ever!! Lebron did it all by himself from day fucking one in the NBA!!! LET THAT SINK IN. All this achievements I have just told u guys, entitles Lebron fucking James to be on the same page with Michael Jordan. MJ has the killer instinct but Lebron James' heart is in the game all the time. MJ's greatness resided in his unmatchable grind and psycopethic competing fetish, while James' greatness is that he is driven by his heart. They are BOTH the number 1 players to ever play the game. U can not be better than Jordan. He is a God. But so is James. They are tied on the first place. Period. I don't care that MJ has more rings, because that is not what define's who the greatest is. The only thing that matters is the impact u make on court. nothing else. Thats how u become the greatest. lets imagine if u were in a team for ten 10 years winning 10 rings, but u're scoring avg was 7 each game. u still have 10 rings but u haven't made impact. u haven't earned the love of a whole world. Now thats why they are the greatest.",7년 전,0,

@tylergary5953,"Manu Ginobilis Bald Spot what are you talking about lmao? This was the fluke? Please explain how the best player in the world (LeBron) carrying his team back from a 3-1 deficit in the finals and putting up historic numbers and basically doing everything is a fluke. He obviously had kyrie who played a huge part and really helped carry the team as well, but games 5,6, and 7, LeBron showed up huge. Back to back 41 point games. To me, this game solidified what I already knew. The warriors weren't as good as they, and a lot of people thought. If anything the 2015 series was The fluke. The fact that they barely beat the cavs in the 2015 finals with just LeBron and no kyrie or love, already showed me that they were overhyped, and the 2016 series proved if to me. 2017 showed me that they needed everyone possible to beat LeBron. They couldn't handle the pressure on their own, so they got the guy who also choked a 3-1 lead to help them tame lebron. This isn't me hating on how great the warriors have been, I'm just stating facts.",7년 전,1,

I like KD but i just dont feel like him winning in GS is gonna happen Curry can either win and re-sign or lose and leave Golden State which i doubt will happen but anything is possible I wanna see Cavs beat GS two years in a row but its  a tough call look forward to this match up. a shocker  would be if Cavs get swept like alotta ppl say they will be. but im sticking to 4-1 Cavs repeat thats my opinion,8년 전,0,

@corleo02672123,It just dawned on me watching this... After Kyrie hits the go ahead 3 to make it 92-89 and then after Curry misses the three to tie on the Warriors next possession... after Lebron rebounds Curry's miss he seems to give Kyrie a signal as he passes him the ball and Kyrie takes off and I think the signal was for Kyrie to drive and try to score quickly. The commentators stated that they were puzzled on Kyries's  decision to try and drive baseline... but I think that's the way Cleveland planned it if the Warriors missed following the go ahead basket. I think they knew they had to go up quickly if they could... Knowing a 3 point lead was too close to play it safe and try to kill time vs a team like the Warriors.,8년 전,0,

His actual block was clean, perfectly timed, it's when his left hand hit the rim. It wasn't called and thankfully it shouldn't have been called because his left hand touching the rim had zero impact on the play plus on the other end Kyrie was hacked going for a layup and it wasn't called so it all balanced out.

@LifelsGreat,+Member Berry it's hard to believe you link me a YouTube video where you commented a defense statement for them. Then I'll believe you 100%. Besides Curry himself said he was fine and there was no excuse how are his fans gonna make his excuses for him despite him admitting to FUCKING up? He sure seemed healthy to come back from a 3-1 deficit against OKC.. So what happened after that? C'mon man are you really willing to drag yourself into believing your own lies and then try forcing them onto other people?,8년 전,0,

All of the shots they got were good looks and looks that steph had taken and made all year. And Kyrie’s shot wasn’t a great shot, it was a step back that he just made. Ultimately Cleveland deserved credit, but the warriors deserve an equal amount of blame.  It goes both ways, I’m a Tom Brady fan and the comeback vs Atlanta was great but Atlanta self imploded as well.  You can’t have a great comeback unless the other team collapses in a way as well.  Everything had to go exactly right for both the Cavs and the patriots and they did and that’s why they’re both champs.  They deserve credit for sure.

On the road. With the game tied. Wilt did some regular season shit THIS was for everything. He literally STOLE the championship from the Warriors with that block. Game was over to whoever scored first and every player on the court knew it. Deadlocked after several missed shots on both sides and then what seems like an easy transition basket just stuffed on the board by the only player who could have made it across the entire court in time.,5년 전,3,
