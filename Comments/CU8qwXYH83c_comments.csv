@nishamadhu8153,"A few weeks ago, I was chatting with a friend about how manifesting never seemed to work for me. I’d tried so many methods but still felt stuck. We heard about a book called Manifest the Unseen by Luna Rivers on a podcast, and I was hesitant at first. But after reading just a few chapters, I realized how much I was missing. Luna's approach is so different from anything I’ve ever tried. It’s not just about thinking positive, it’s about aligning with real-world actions that bring your desires into reality. Now, I’ve manifested opportunities I never imagined possible, and my mindset has shifted completely. If you’re frustrated like I was, don’t hesitate. Read this book. It will change everything ❤",3개월 전,540,

I'm just not able to see celebrities and keep my cool. Similar thing happened with Ryan Gosling at some little secret speakeasy with a Depression-era theme. Of course, I talked about how one guy in the crowd looked like Ryan Phillipe. And a girl said, ""I think you mean Ryan Gosling,"" and I said, ""oh yes, that's who."" So then the rest of the night I kept referring to him as a joke but not meaning anything by it, but suddenly he was standing 5 feet behind me with a look straight out of one of his sad movies such as Blue Valentine. And then he left! I mean, jeeze, let a regular dude apologize, Ryan. It's not about you. Well, almost everything I said that night was.... Sorry, again.

So many people fall out with Gavin and I'm beginning to suspect it has NOTHING to do with his incredibly unfiltered, 'incorrect' political views but more to do with his hugely problematic personality. Spikey, narcissistic, controlling and slightly psychopathic. People overlook difficult politics if behind the scenes you are a terrific friend and great company and treat people well. I'm in two minds about McInnes's unceremonious dumping in social Siberia. He surrounds himself with halfwit lackeys, all half his age with half his brain cells and suspect he likes to Lord it over inferiors and hold court rather than cultivate a peer group of successful, charismatic, intellectual equals. He tends to squirm and get combative and domineering if challenged by a strong, charismatic, intelligent socially relevant person. I feel sad to see this mighty man topple into such undignified, unbecoming squalor of sorts.

For the normal folk, being too romantic at first it's a no for me, people don't even know each other. I find it odd. The other girl shares the same ideas as me, I guess. It's just a matter of finding like minded people, not everyone is gonna like everyone's ways of actions and that's it.

The deadline and intangible date for the start of the Tribulations is the evening of November 12, 2023 --> HORROR ON EARTH.  It is your faith in the shed BLOOD of Our Lord Jesus Christ, on the Cross, which will save you from these Tribulations  Those left behind, on earth, will experience unimaginable horrors after the Rapture of the Church within 9 days, prepare to suffer for Christ, shedding your own blood for Him, for this will be your only possibility after the Rapture of the Church.  Because having refused HIS BLOOD TO THE CROSS until this Rapture of the Church, you will then have to suffer and die for JESUS CHRIST in order to obtain eternal life, at your death, because yes.... after your death earthly for CHRIST, you will go to Heaven, because you will have carried your cross.

@cussyrichards6121," @noyonika2245  you could argue that height lasts forever. Well, you shrink with age but that makes it all the more important to be 6ft 9in when you're young so you can shrink to merely 6ft 2in when you're old. Personality doesn't last forever, people get Alzheimer's. So height is more often than not the 'entrance requirement' for women.

Yes, the humor might‘ve been why Emily chose him (after all, she could get any tall and handsome man she wants), but if John were short and fat, Emily would have NEVER chosen him. You all know it‘s the truth.  Men need to be good-looking too, it‘s not just you women who have to look good. In fact, men have to ALSO have humor and intelligence, be cool, help in the household but also have to do „men work“ like lawn mowing. And has to be good with children. Women only have to look decent (not even good). You women have it a LOT easier in this world than men (western world, at least. 3rd world is different of course).",4년 전,0,

The deadline and intangible date for the start of the Tribulations is the evening of November 12, 2023 --> HORROR ON EARTH.  It is your faith in the shed BLOOD of Our Lord Jesus Christ, on the Cross, which will save you from these Tribulations  Those left behind, on earth, will experience unimaginable horrors after the Rapture of the Church within 9 days, prepare to suffer for Christ, shedding your own blood for Him, for this will be your only possibility after the Rapture of the Church.  Because having refused HIS BLOOD TO THE CROSS until this Rapture of the Church, you will then have to suffer and die for JESUS CHRIST in order to obtain eternal life, at your death, because yes.... after your death earthly for CHRIST, you will go to Heaven, because you will have carried your cross.

@kathxtantp1580,"As a woman who has worked in the modeling and talent industries swimming with gorgeous men of all types for decades, I would say most of the comments here about John K's looks are either too unfavorable and made by insecure individuals, or too fangirl-ish and inaccurately overly-complimentary at the opposite end of the spectrum. When John was on ""The Office"", had he not been playing the role of the ""Aw Shucks""-unrequited and ultimately triumphant suitor of Pam, and just been another regular cubicle worker, he certainly would not have been as noticed or highly-regarded by women or men. So he definitely benefitted by the show writers' largesse and arc of his character, there. And he's since built upon that image very well, even in ""non-love"" roles.  Also, John's physical look as a man is definitely ""high-average"" 6+ on a scale of 10(yes, women have those too for men lol). But, his then unstable, fluff and comb it forward hairline in his early career(which he has since thickened up and ""fixed"" now that he's a millionaire), and his somewhat ""box-jaw/slight double-chin""(we used to call that the ""Fred Flintstone""-chin lol), was definitely a detraction to his overall look. If you notice now, John is pretty set on wearing a beard, which I believe, hides those less than attractive facial features. Plus, beards are in style and add to his ""rugged manliness""-appeal.  His eyes are very pretty. Almost unnnaturally so. That is undeniable. And he knows just how to flash them in that enthusiastic, ""happy over the small things""-way, that most women swoon over, unless they're an unmovable, Ingmar Bergman film binge-watching, perpetual Goth chick with black eyeliner on her soul.   Now, onto the hard part ~ It's not telling tales out of school to recognize the fact that John is a very tall man. Offically listed at 6'3"" but, he appears much taller than that in film and talk show appearances. Height for most women in judging men, is like bosom size for men in judging women. There are undeniable, evolutionarily-biological components of attraction there, that cannot be ignored. Many things can be overlooked by a woman in judging a man, if a he's tall. Sorry guys and women who deny this out of fear as being perceived as being ""shallow"", but for the most part it's absolutely true.  Having said that, and recognizing the obvious edge John has over 70% of the U.S male population that isn't over 6'2"", it's also very fair to say that theoretically if John Krasinski were as proportionally attractive with the same show biz cachet, money and with the same features but scaled down to a 5'9""-tall man, at least 60% of the women here who ""swoon"" over John K, would simply not be doing so and even if they were, there would be serious caveats to their attraction.    The only guys who can get away with being ""short"" in the entertainment industry and still be seen as sex symbols and attract women above their pay grade, are rock stars. My .02 and assessment. Rip me to shreds, if you will. It still won't change the relative subjective truth in what I said.",6년 전,1,

For example it could be like a distribution where someone is an 7 and then there are ofc people who would see it as a 6 or 8 but the more u go to the extremes the less people think that of this person who is a 7. So there is a confidence interval like with a normal distribution.  Or you can see it as, what the majority thinks, like there are always weirdos out there. There are always outliers who would say my little pony is the best show ever made in history.   And there is difference between what someone is attracted towards and what is beauty. I think even most weirdass goths girls who like a skinny sickly wide dude full of tattoos piercing etc etc, would agree that they are attracted towards it but that for example a brad pitt is more beautiful.",2년 전,0,

The deadline and intangible date for the start of the Tribulations is the evening of November 12, 2023 --> HORROR ON EARTH.  It is your faith in the shed BLOOD of Our Lord Jesus Christ, on the Cross, which will save you from these Tribulations  Those left behind, on earth, will experience unimaginable horrors after the Rapture of the Church within 9 days, prepare to suffer for Christ, shedding your own blood for Him, for this will be your only possibility after the Rapture of the Church.  Because having refused HIS BLOOD TO THE CROSS until this Rapture of the Church, you will then have to suffer and die for JESUS CHRIST in order to obtain eternal life, at your death, because yes.... after your death earthly for CHRIST, you will go to Heaven, because you will have carried your cross.
