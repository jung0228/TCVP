@joebyvictor,"Great insights as usual, thanks Marques! I genuinely think this is all about price point and accessibility. For anyone who's done an Apple Vision Pro demo in the Apple Store, they will know how insane and potentially game changing it could be for everyone. The fact is people aren't going to drop $3500 for a supplementary (or what they see as supplementary) product. People still need their phones and their laptops/iPads, so this isn't a primary device, at least not in the current iteration, so not being able to squeeze AVP into people's tech budget cannot be underestimated as a barrier..  The high price point has also means most people haven't actually tried AVP themselves, and as someone who thought it was cool whilst watching all of the initial videos and hype, I couldn't prepare myself for just how blown away I was when I finally tried it last month for the first time, I remember thinking ""I NEED to have this in my life!"" So the magic of this device ONLY comes with trying it, and most people won't - again because of the price.   I don't see AR glasses in the same category, they're much more practical and allow us to do everyday tasks more efficiently and simultaneously. Whilst they do and will offer some really neat features, it's a completely different product line and it's not about immersion it's about utility and accessibility, but they definitely have wider everyday appeal. It's for this reason that I believe Apple Vision Pro will still have it's viral moment, Apple will unveil a cheaper more comfortable accessible version or Vision Pro with arguably even more functionality, it's just a matter of when not if.  It definitely feels like Apple is trying to get ahead of the curve or at least, be in the race with AR glasses. I think it's a smart decision, but I do wish they hadn't dropped development of AVP. If any company could resource multiple high-end products – Apple can! But I think it's a decision resulting from the market moving at such a rapid pace, and with all of the issues with Apple Intelligence and failures of internal resources, they're being more focused and cautious with future projects, which is sensible, and whilst disappointing for AVP, I think it means we will get a REALLY good AR glass product as a result.  I'm confident Apple will return to AVP once glasses are up and walking.   In the mean time I will be getting the AVP soon and cannot wait! EDIT - I work in AV in my day job and I'm a video editor so I get that my reaction to and use case of AVP is going to be pumped up compared tp most regular tech users. For me, those little incremental upgrades have tipped the scales and I've been saving!",2일 전(수정됨),0,

Yes there are a few very niche usecases in which an avp / quest pro makes sense, but most of the times cheaper/lighter vr / mr headsets like the quest 3 or bigscreen beyond (2), valve Index, etc. make more sense.

@invox_in_your_inbox,"Apple's team should really pivot they're usageof this device from ""outside wear augmented reality"", to ""indoor multi-screen station"". They could easelly have 3 tiers for it: Vision Pro - as is. Vision - Standard (office) edition. Battery sold seperatly. Could be plugged to a computer or to standard power outlet. Maybe ditch the front ""eye"" screen and/or minimize gestures capture (could be replaced by wristband, pad, keyboard, pencil, etc; depending on the intended use). All this to REDUCE PRICE! Useful to professionals who want/need multiple screens: movie editors, ilustration designers, 3d scultures, stock exchange investors, even writers using multiple sources, etc.  Lite - Home (leisure) edition. The single best/most use people praise, and get put of, it is Home Cinema. So, no frontal screen, no frontal camera, reduced or no tracking gestures. Still useful for gaming, since even non-VR titles could be played on a big screen and have head tracking. Or just have multiple screens for whatever use.

@Gaurav-bu5be,"🧠 Summary Apple’s second-generation Vision Pro headset gets a modest upgrade: the new M5 chip and a redesigned Dual Knit Band. While performance improves slightly, the core hardware remains unchanged—same cameras, displays, frame, and weight. The real story? Apple seems to be quietly pivoting away from headsets toward smart glasses, acknowledging that the Vision Pro hasn’t become the mainstream hit they hoped for.  🔍 Highlights 0:20 M5 Chip Arrives  Apple introduces the base M5 chip in Vision Pro, iPad Pro, and 14"" MacBook Pro.  No M5 Pro/Max yet; high-end devices like Mac Studio still on older chips.  1:51 Hardware: Mostly the Same  Vision Pro retains same frame, sensors, displays, and battery.  No weight reduction; in fact, it’s slightly heavier due to the new band.  3:09 Dual Knit Band Upgrade  Replaces the uncomfortable Solo Knit Band.  Adds tungsten counterweights and adjustable dials for better comfort.  Available separately for $99.  4:52 Performance Gains  Faster app loading, better rendering, and ~20% longer battery life.  Minor visual improvements (e.g., 120Hz refresh vs. 100Hz).  Most users won’t notice the difference.  6:36 Market Shift & Competition  Samsung launches its own XR headset (“Project Moohan”) with Android XR.  Few other companies are competing in high-end headset space.  7:44 Smart Glasses Rising  Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses show faster innovation and broader appeal.  Lower social penalty makes them more wearable in public.  9:14 Apple’s Strategic Pivot  Vision Pro mostly used for movies and gathers dust.  Apple reportedly cancels lighter “Vision Pro Air” and shifts focus to smart glasses.  Reflects broader industry trend: trimming down headsets vs. building up glasses.",3주 전,0,

@GolferChris68,"It's a device without a purpose, and without a large pool of potential consumers. No reason for this to exist as a product other than as a tech demo.   This is not something you would carry around with you, and if you're at home, there are better, more comfortable ways to consume media - TVs, monitors and iPads. Watching a two-hour movie on this thing would be tiring. Gaming would be the obvious use case here, but $3,500 gets you a pretty sweet gaming rig and a handheld like a Switch 2 or ROG Ally X with a much better game library and a more comfortable experience. Would be hard to justify spending $3,500 on a device that will be used a handful of times, then dumped in a drawer to collect dust with other niche tech.",3주 전(수정됨),0,

Varjo left the prosumer market completely, focussing on industry to buy its $5k-10k product. Despite being one of the best PC headsets, we're still awaiting Valve's second headset on top of its first...from 2020. Apple has singularly been the outlier in this space, taking very little out of its profit (and any of its megatons of cash) to build and sell these units. It would seem their economics would outrun even Samsung on that playground given their cash hoard.

@webrevolution.,"The main issue with the Vision Pro is its lack of actually engaging videogames. If I could start playing some sort of COD like on a VR headset but with the added benefit of maybe playing that game in a virtual scenario which is basically real, it would be soo appealing. Like imagine fighting a war with people inside your own house. You scan that beforehand to create the map and lobby and then ask your friends to join in and you start playing in it. Not even just COD but whatever. That would be sick. Vision Pro has a HUUUUUGE potential in the videogame market and I think many gamers would be willing to spend that amount of money on it given how many people I know whose gaming setup cost way more than 3,5k to build up. Sadly though, I don't think that would happen anytime soon. And also whenever it will happen, I doubt it will be Apple the one winking their eye to gamers. It's just not in their business model. But try to think of it. Would you buy a product like that, even with a price tag of 3,5k if it could actually allow you to play games in an ""AR mode""?

Or something like that!  Not that long ago apple was able to tap each other's phones and pass a pic. Years ago on samsung, the large amount of storage, but apple gives little storage to force you to buy storage. The oled screens. The folding phones, the flip phones, the waterfall edge screens. Bigger phones. All samsung. New, better. IPhone brings out several phones a year, with absolutely nothing added that actually really matters, but people go crazy just because its a new color just to slap on a crappie 20 dollar case?!?!?! C'mon! Now this $3500 generation 2 with absolutely no new stuff but a chip? All to save u 5 seconds of loading?!?! Get the hell out of here! Im not saying get a samsung, Google has great phones too. People are always trying to compare a iphone to the android phone that their parents have, but what they don't mention is that their parents have that shitty 400 dollar phone that is not a flagship phone, but I think apple is smart, they keep the price at around $1000 range. So you either have it or u don't. As of where other companies make phones for all price ranges, 300, 500, 1500, and 2000 for the folding with taxes lol!

And though they claim that ''the camera is better"" even though being proven wrong with specs, ........they will not change or at least admit that they are being screwed..... that they are buying iphones simply because its a status symbol. Now go on, and buy the same damn headset with absolutely zero actual improvements, and go buy the newest iPhone that have been the same for the past years! The only actual upgrade has been the home button being taken away. Since apple ALWAYS copies, I bet whats next is a folding phone from apple in years to come, claim its the newest technology and charge 5000 for it. And all they ever say is ohh the color of the text get messed up, when the other phone brands can communicate perfectly fine, it has also been brought out that apple sets the msg limitations. Not the others. Some people are going to say, just let people have whatever they want in peace! I agree, iphones are great phones, but when people say they just want the best... then mean it, don't be easily stupified.",3주 전(수정됨),1,

@justuknown4059,"Jesus loves you all that He died for you and rose days later conquering death. He died for our sins something we can’t wash on our own. He paid for our sins so that we can have a relationship with Him and have salvation and eternal life in heaven. He’s calling you whether you fallen out of your faith or if you didn’t have any at all. It doesn’t matter what you’ve done, He still wants you to come to Him. He’s wants you to accept the freely given gift He has given us, paid by His blood on the cross. For those who don’t believe or don’t know if He’s real or not, find out for yourselves! You won’t know if you actually seek Him. In Jeremiah 29:12-14 it’s says “Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you. And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart. And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith the LORD; and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive.”  If you actually seek Him with your heart, meaning you actually want to know if He’s real or not; He said himself “you will find me”. Again to the LORD it doesn’t not matter what you’ve done, no sin can separate us from His love. That’s what He desire the most; is us being near to Him. In Him we can find freedom and peace, real and permanent peace and freedom. That hole that you feel within that you tried to fill with worldly things, He can fill that hole permanently. He is returning and He wants as much as many people to make in heaven, but you have to make the choice getting into heaven is something you choice not something you work your way in. Ephesians 2:8-10. I love you all but Jesus you love more than ever! ￼      ‭‭",3주 전,0,

So he went from describing it as distributing the weight across your forehead and cheeks, to now saying it concentrates lots of weight on your nose. He never said anything in the original review about the nose being a pressure point. On top of that, he has gone from saying back then it could be worn for 30-45 minutes, to now admitting it's unbearable after 10 minutes.

@WAATANG,"I have one and think it’s the best piece of tech I’ve ever had. The capability of the headset itself is amazing. For me the absolute best use of the headset is one which the rest of the world isn’t setup for yet and apple haven’t pushed (but strangely is their biggest marketing/selling point on phones) - personal home photos and videos but in VR180 (if you don’t know what that is, look it up!) I have a dual lens camera which is homemade but canon do sell one at an eyewatering price. It takes dual 180 degree 16k photos and video which you can import onto the headset and literally rewatch in insane quality on the vision pro display. It’s like you’re looking through your eyes again in 3 dimensional viewing and at the correct scale (which is something you don’t realise current viewing of media doesn’t do, it has a huge impact in the reality of it). It’s the real deal and is unbelievable, it’s truly the future and is already here but it’s not accessible and not widely known about. When i show my friends the VR180 photos they all have no idea it existed and they are blown away by it. I bought the vision pro and VR180 camera upon the birth of my daughter and we can put the headset on and look at her aged 1 day old in the exact same way! It makes traditional photos seem like the stone age. The vision pro itself does take a small 3d picture but it’s nothing compared to VR180.  Unfortunately as vision pro is so expensive there is a small number of people who have them. This combined with a misplaced negative opinion about what it does mainly fuelled by its price, means it has not received the investment from developers that it needs. It’s a different offering to quest 3, those who compare them like the old playstation vs xbox argument are completely missing the point. I do understand their frustration. If it was more accessible to the masses the future development of this product line would change the world like it should be. Instead, for most people it’s only useful for watching films on (viewing quality on vision pro is the best you’ll see) The Apple VR180 documentaries and ringside sports viewing are unreal, my grandad gets to see elephants again like he’s there again in his youth when he could travel, he cried when he saw this. The few apps which did get development are amazing. Due to this slow uptake and this stagnant innovation from apple, it’s clear that it’s before it’s time. I have no doubt this will be the future. I am sad to see that the innovation is not as fast as I want it to be and the camera market is non existent. I am so glad they made it available so I already get to make use of that future, when I’m old I will one of few people my age who can look back and relive memories of my family and my daughter growing up.",3주 전(수정됨),1,

The downside has been that because it needs to be connected via USB, our corporate security software shuts down data when it senses the USB plugged in. The workaround requires that I plug an hdmi in to the computer, plug XReal usb into output plug of hdmi adapter,the power usb into said adapter and into the laptop with a data blocker adapter.

@aWaRLoCK2045,"I have an Apple Vision Pro M2 and even though I overall don't regret purchasing it, I really just have no good reason to spend another nearly $5K on an Apple Vision Pro M5. Yes, that is what my AVPM2 cost after getting the 1TB storage, plus AppleCare, plus taxes, around $4800 as I recall. I get it that Apple never marketed the AVP as a VR device but that is where the attraction is for a lot of  people overall and it is in the VR games.  I sorta had the ""Fields Of Dreams"" mentality when it came to the AVPM2 meaning ""if you build it, they (developers) will come"".  Except the gaming developers for the most part never showed up.  Sure there are a handful of VR games like Job Simulator, Demeo, Vacation Simulator, Synth Riders, Fruit Ninja but those are mostly very old games now for any VR headset.  Honestly, as fantastic graphically, as the AVPM2 appears, is it even capable of playing the plethora of VR games that you see on the Meta Quest 3, if developers chose to port any of those games over??  Like Metro Awakening VR, Alien Rogue Incursion VR, Behemoth VR, etc.  I have never seen any evidence in the AVPM2 that it is even capable of a 1st Person Shooter game thus far.  That has always been where my disappointment has been meaning there are not a lot of actual VR games.  I always felt that if Apple had truly worked with VR developers and had launched with 20+ actual great VR games that it would have been way more successful.  As it is, we keep getting these AR games that, in my opinion, don't have long term appeal. Anyway, been supporting Apple for many decades, and keep hoping for more VR gaming support from developers.

@RahulAg-e5q,"Apple should rethink the design of Vision Pro. Instead of building a full computer inside the headset, they can keep only the display system, sensors, and the R1 chip for camera processing and calibration, and remove the main CPU and heavy processing hardware from the headset. The battery can be built inside the Vision Pro for convenience, and the external pack can become an optional CPU module.  Then the Vision Pro could connect through Type-C or Thunderbolt to an iPhone, iPad, or Mac, and use the processing power of that device. That way, if someone already has a powerful MacBook or iPhone, they don’t need to pay again for a second CPU inside the headset. They just connect it and instantly get full performance with zero lag through Thunderbolt.  For people who want to use the Vision Pro as a standalone computer, Apple could sell the external CPU module separately, similar to the current battery pack but with actual processing hardware inside it. This would make the Vision Pro more modular, more affordable, and more flexible.",3주 전,0,

The re-release is just a double-check to make sure people actually don’t want it.  The most offensive part of this is the price staying the same. I get it on the first unit, where it’s cost is billions of dollars, but we should’ve seen a $1k or more price drop to make this generation even remotely interesting. The problem is that selling a premium option in a world that doesn’t care about any tier of VR headset just doesn’t work.

I was on an 11 hour flight last week and it flew by because I’m watching Oppenheimer and it’s like I’m at the theater.

@Gamebatt1,"Let’s start with the fact that you could’ve simply said this was just a chip refresh , with a new Dual Knit Band. But when you want to sound more dramatic, you start listing every single part that didn’t change. Updating the Vision Pro from M2 to M5 is much needed. The M2 was the least impressive generational jump in Apple’s entire Silicon lineup. The M3 introduced a new 3nm process, hardware ray tracing, Dynamic Caching, and much better efficiency. But you’re careless, unprofessional, and incompetent. Apple only posted this on its website , they didn’t even bother uploading a YouTube presentation, which makes your “review” look even more ridiculous. Every proper review pointed out that the new chip makes a radical difference, but you somehow didn’t find that worth mentioning.",3주 전,0,

It might not be exactly crystal clear or fast compared to vision pro, but they do the Nintendo Way and it's just good enough.   I just gave it to my nephew and his father, who never tried a VR/XR device before and they were mind blown. And thats what you want to achieve as a successful consumer product.

The iPad Air m3 was cheap enough to use a beta on and see how it went with the upgraded features. It does work more like a laptop than an iPad ever has but it’s still just lacking the full desktop experience. It would be cool if we got a Vision SE. just lose a few things like the eyeball thing, cameras that can go will go, and just any other unneeded stuff. Maybe a cheaper material to be made out of or even just an older chip. Move it down to the 1500-2000 dollar price range. I’m sure a lot more people would jump in on it, instead of 3500 dollars.

I was working once on the 3D scanning of the heritage site so the students in another country could “visit” it with the Quest 3. That was absolutely amazing, I am sure with the Apple Silicone it would be even better. The problem is that the museums and cultural institutions rarely have money for that 😅 and Apple would never sponsor such projects I assume.  Another problem with the shared use of VR sets is that you have to quickly clean it somehow, so it means somebody has to build a special device for that specific purpose.

Similarly, while the Vision Pro may seem stagnant to some, critics are overlooking its groundbreaking potential as we enter a new digital era. The first iteration of any technology is always exciting but rarely widely adopted right away.   Consider the early days of mobile phones bulky and impractical or the first wired headphones. Most innovations start off a bit awkward and unrefined.

People with glasses are already doing the same thing everyday; take them out of the case, put them on and they go about their routine. The glasses doesn't hamper your routine. - Price: Glasses will be widely used and will have a lower price tag. - Non-full Immersion: People will appreciate if immersion is not full, at least for the average consumer. If you are working and people often need your attention then glasses do not compromise it, where as the the VR/AR headsets needs you to remove them or pause/stop whatever you are doing to give your full attention to someone.  The headsets only win in one category: Full immersion. Other than that, it not convenient, its not pocket friendly and it obstructs your senses, not to remind you, the screens are literally 2 centimeters from your eyes which causes you screen fatigue which isn't great for in the long run.

@CarlosOsuna1970,"Quick thought MB:  maybe if we extrapolate Vision Pro and Meta Ray-ban Display into Apple past we can know where they are going.  So Vision Pro and Meta Quest are kinda like the Apple Lisa and the Xerox Star, maybe not in that order, but you get the drill.  A grandeur imagineering of what's coming but not really the exact vision people want.  Larry Tesler which invented the Alto, helped on the Star and took full ownership of the Lisa was more famous for the invention of copy-paste and WYSIWYG didn't quite got it even after 3 different approaches.  So this might be the case with the VR headsets, the form factor might be all wrong and the interface might be a little off.  But the Meta Ray-Ban Display might be the Apple Macintosh which was a proto laptop just with a CRT and a detachable keyboard.  Today we know those two were a mistake and that people wanted an integrated system (like the Amiga 1200) but that also included an LCD display and a trackpad, just like the First PowerBooks.  Meta's greatest achievement it's the Meta Neural Band but they need more to advance that device. Eventually they could invent the VGA of Smart Glasses, but they need to think outside of their box and stop forcing only Meta only apps there.",4주 전,0,

@ramkumarrealm,"“What’s Going on with Apple Vision Pro?”:  Apple Vision Pro 2 (2025): The second-gen Vision Pro headset keeps the same design, displays, sensors, and core features as the original but upgrades the processor from M2 to the new M5 chip.  What’s New: The main upgrade is a redesigned, much more comfortable dual-knit band, which distributes the weight better—but actually results in a slightly heavier device. You can also buy this new band separately for the original Vision Pro.  Performance: The M5 chip brings faster app loading, a minor increase in rendered pixels, and about 20% more battery life. But these are small improvements—most everyday users won’t notice dramatic differences.  Software: All Vision Pros now get new visionOS 26 features, including better personas, pinnable widgets, and converting photos into spatial scenes.  No Major Redesign: The core complaints from the first version (heaviness, comfort) persist except for the improved band. Cameras, displays, and general form factor are unchanged.  Market Context: Samsung has entered the market with its Android XR headset, but otherwise, few companies are releasing direct Vision Pro competitors. Meanwhile, the smart glasses category (like Meta Ray-Bans) is advancing rapidly and becoming more appealing to regular users.  Apple’s Strategic Shift: Usage data shows most people use Vision Pro mainly for movies, and many units are gathering dust. Apple appears to be scaling back ambition—reportedly canceling lighter Vision Pro versions and shifting focus to smart glasses, where social acceptance and utility are higher.  Industry Trend: Tech firms are attacking “mixed reality” from two directions: big, powerful headsets like Vision Pro (trimming them down) or smart glasses (building them up). The latter approach is gaining real-world traction.  Bottom line: The Vision Pro 2 offers modest technical improvements. The industry is watching whether XR headsets or lightweight smart glasses will win the future of “face computers”—for now, more people prefer smart glasses for everyday use.",4주 전,0,

@NoirRainShadow,"I want to cook without taking my eyes off the movie, walk the dog, jog in the evening/morning twilight, ride a bike, or go shopping. I don't want a cable tugging me to my phone/battery on my belt. Give me lightweight, completely clear aviator glasses with a display and removable tinted lenses, put the battery and ALL the electronics, including the processors, in a separate unit on my neck like a Viture necklace, and let me watch movies, TV shows, and read books, comics, and manga, but for at least 10-12 hours without recharging, not just a couple of hours. I'm comfortable wearing heavy, full-size headphones around my neck; it's definitely more comfortable than having that weight on my nose or on a wire in my pants. Leave only the displays, glasses, and camera on my nose, maybe. I don't need a dumb AI assistant that understands only every third word. The camera isn't that heavy, and I can live without the hand-tracking video system; the virtual keyboard is inconvenient anyway. Gaming with glasses is also unnecessary, considering how many dongles and pairing time it requires. Leave me the wristband with a tiny domino touchpad on the pendant for navigation, if your führer-Zuckerberg bought all the rights to muscle tracking. A small credit-card-sized Bluetooth keyboard is enough for me to type. Or split it into two controllers on wristbands. I HATE sluggish, slow body-tracking, ever since the XBOX 360.

@five-toedslothbear,"Thanks for the video. It’s been a 7 hour Vision Pro day for me so far, and I’m planning to upgrade from the M2 to M5 model. I think there’s room for both types of headsets. I don’t think I’d ever use smart glasses: I’d need prescription smart glasses with another set of $300 lenses in them, and now I wear both progressives and bifocal computer glasses, so two sets of smart glasses to go with my two sets of dumb glasses? Smart glasses good, but I’m probably not the audience.  But, I’m comfortable for hours in the Vision Pro, the fixed focal distance works well with my presbyopia.   I think it’s a good move. The current Vision Pro is insanely great tech that needs more content and apps. Besides the chip upgrade, I don’t think there’s any room to spec anything else up.  Apple can make some smart glasses, which they should do, and once that happens, the start of the art for immersive wear will move, and they can work on better, faster, lighter immersive kit. I think there is a market for both form factors, just like there’s a market for tablet and laptop. That’s my take.",4주 전,0,

For comparison, the AVP's h.FOV is only around 100 and has poor-to-average stereo/binocular overlap of around 80 degrees. Weight-wise, the Dream Air weighs under 170 g (under 0.37 lbs) compared to the Vision Pro's 650 to 800 grams (1.43 to 1.76 lbs) excluding battery. The Pimax does all that while costing only 36% to 46% of the Apple at 2000 to 2300 USD VS the AVP's 5000 to 5600 USD.",4주 전(수정됨),0,

Why can I buy an iPad with an M5, a MacBook Pro with an M4 Max, a Mac Studio with an M3 Ultra, an iMac with an M4, and a Mac mini with an M4 Pro? It feels like every product in Apple’s lineup is on a completely different release cycle, sometimes years apart.  I remember when you could walk into an Apple Store and buy an iMac, a MacBook, a MacBook Pro, and a Mac Pro — and they were all on the same generation of hardware. You knew that when you made that purchase, you were getting the most up-to-date machine available. Now it just feels like an enormous compromise if you want a different form factor. I’d love to have an M5 Max iMac, but that’s clearly not happening, so I have to settle for the MacBook Pro.

Apple is pitching this like a wearable computer (with specs to match) but the software model is like the iPhone and iPad. The benefit of a Mac Is that you can develop software on a Mac, compile on a Mac, then run that software without needing to get app store approval, pay a cut to apple etc. This allows developers to easily play around with the hardware and make compelling software (which you need to move units). The apple vision pro is a marvelous piece of hardware with no compelling apps!   I am an aerospace engineer and if I can do parametric CAD on this thing I would pick it up in 2 seconds, but that isn't going to happen if the software distribution model is like an iPad. And if the only things you can run on this thing are glorified iPhone apps, its no wonder they are losing out to cheaper smart glasses which can also run smartphone apps.

@vexylthefloof,What's super funny about the Vision Pro is Apple basically just stole Microsoft's idea. Microsoft tried doing this a decade before everyone else. WMR (Windows Mixed Reality) was envisioned to become what Apple Vision Pro is. They wanted to blend both virtual reality with the real world. That was their end goal. They just were too early and the tech wasn't there yet. And Microsoft being Microsoft they gave up instead of keeping at it. I had the cheaper VR headset but the higher end ones like the Samsung and eventually the HP G2 (Underrated as a VR headset as it had unmatched displayed for immersion) and then the Hololens which was the high end device Microsoft was working on which was their Vision Pro basically. Kind of wish Microsoft stuck at it as Hololens tech was actually insane. The same tech helped to do the live AR CGI at the Leage of Legends Worlds Opening Ceremonies for 2016 and 2018 and 2020.

And if they can trim down the device into about the 2299 price point, then this device would be an indispensable device for not just enterprise purposes, but for all of the above, it would be primarily used at home and ideally in a room that has nothing on the wall that can be used as a viewing room for that purpose.

The small minor improvements is laughable. Top that off with still being locked into Apple Ecosystem so ""you are only allowed the apps we tell you"" mindset, and it's not cheaper. Isn't the point of new technology to improve and then the older becomes cheaper?? Where are the original Vision Pro's with the M2 chip now and why aren't they heavily discounted? Let's also not kid ourselves - the reason these are so expensive is because of the Apple Tax. The MetaQuest 3 is suitable for nearly everyone and they are about 10% of the price of these. Why compete in a space that Apple has made up by themselves? ""Premium VR/XR"" - yeah no... It still has all of the shortfalls of every other VR/AR experience which is battery life, comfort and distortion when in real space. Let's not think that Apple is somehow a big genius company because they managed to do this and slap a $3,500 and call it ""Premium"".

@tytyyea1,"Nothing changed on purpose so that companies who are developing sdks and applications for the Apple Vision Pro don’t have to throw out half of their effort. I’ve developed applications for the HoloLens 2 and Magic Leap 2 and will be developing an application for the Apple Vision Pro. I’m not choosing the Apple Vision Pro because it’s best but rather because those other devices will be discontinued soon. The executives at Apple need as little reason as possible to pull the plug on this project, because it is an incredibly difficult market to find success in when you consider that in the 10 years since the first marketable MR device was released (Microsoft HoloLens 1), every single MR device released has lost the company and investors billions of dollars. Forget commercial success, none have yet proven themselves to be anything other than a massive waste of time and resources. Apple is being smart by extending the lifetime of the platform to allow enough time for the market to stabilize around it.",4주 전(수정됨),0,

@xPir8x,"Having just watched the Tested review of the M5 version of Vision Pro, it's interesting to hear the differences between folks that use the VP near daily and folks like yourself that are a lot more novelty/casual use. Neither are wrong and both make good points, but the interesting thing is there's indepth review from folks that are all in and then there's yeah, but let's look at Vision Pro vs whoever else is making something similar (note: MAN...could that Samsung look more like a knock-off in both hardware and software? Damn.) I'm nowhere near one of those Apple-can-do-no-wrong fanboys, but I'm taking the Vision Pro from the perspective that it's emerging tech and Apple hasn't abandoned it just because the numbers weren't what might have been expected. I like everything you had to say, except for 2 things: we all need to stop emphasizing the price tag. Macbooks, Mini Studio, Mac Pro...none of it is cheap, so why are we laboring over the price of the Vision Pro? Well, because it's seen as a non-essential, luxury niche item and WHOA it's SOOO EXPENSIVE! But for what the tech is, it's really not. Hell, my Powerbook 1400 was over $3k back in the late 90s. The second thing is when has Apple ever had a product that was a straight up, smash hit, clearing the shelves at introduction? Pretty much never. Apple has always wanted to be that, but the reality is that they are more of a slow burn company. Their tech is a slow tide and it eventually catches on and many others make knock offs along the way which only shows off how good the original products are. Yes, other companies are making stuff and they are making it cheaper. If those are the priorities, have at it. Everyone should buy what they want and if that's glasses instead of a headset, have at it. Who cares? I know the Vision Pro isn't for everyone, currently, but it's no Newton. It's not going away. Unless you think about now the iPhone was just the next version of the Newton and the Newton never really went away! Ha! Anyway, solid stuff and nice review, man!

It’s just a shame about the lack of software for now.   One thing I like about it is that Apple made sure other headset makers have to up their lenses game and also include high res Oled because anything less looks horrendous after looking through this.

Those haven't really caught on because they are still just a smartphone, but we have not been able to squeeze smartphone functionalities into smart watch and that's understandable, even desirable I would argue. This suggests that the smart glass should act more like a smart display. With better wireless communication technologies like 5G or Wifi7, I feel it's reaching the point where with a bit of tricks and optimisation; we can offload much of the processing somewhere else like a phone and the smart glass can act as display, interface and data gathering point for them. Trying to do too much on those glasses would be a mistake. Even Meta's implementation feels as if it's trying to do too much on very limited real estate. Much better to leave the heavy lifting somewhere else and do the things that others suck at. If anything, the most exciting thing about Meta implementation is the wrist band thing. Make that work and interface with smart glass will be realised.",4주 전,0,

@carltonascarf7694,"You touched on the social aspect as a reason people aren't wanting to use the vision pro, and specifically you talked about it seeming 'nerdy'. I absolutely agree with that, but I think there is a deeper issue at play.  Technology is cool and using better technology is almost always even cooler. But even as we get more advanced with all this, there's still an innate human lust for nature, friends, family - in short, real life.   When COVID restrictions were easing, people didn't stay indoors and stay on Zoom. We wanted to get out and live our lives again. Experiencing other people is always at the heart of what humans find truly enjoyable.  Products like the vision pro are extremely isolating and take you away from reality, rather than enhancing it. Now inevitably more and more people will buy them and so maybe this will change as and when they become mainstream and easier to wear etc, but I really feel that humanity does have a ceiling to how much we want technology in our lives.  However much it might be difficult and tricky at times, experiencing reality with the people we love is still the best thing that we have, however cringey that may sound.",4주 전,11,

Just because it has a battery doesn't mean you have to walk around with it on the street. Why would you? It's obviously designed for immersive entertainment, work, etc. in VR and AR.

@firstname8637," @AninoNiKugi  Yeah, for me it's the same😅. And ontop of that they don't really seem to offer me much that my regular 200$ phone doesn't. My phone already has a decent camera, it already has internet and maps for navigation. I can watch youtube on it, write e-mails, listen to music ect. and I always have it close at hand. The only thing that the glasses would add to that is not having to pull out my phone from my pocket, which I feel is not that much of a hassle. If they can ever give me something like Batman-scanner-vison to find out where I left my keys again then that might change though😅",4주 전,2,

@AninoNiKugi,"​ @GeorgeOneEleven  People already had phones. They only got better with smartphones. You could argue that smart glasses can be a replacement for phones but you use it a lot different from a phone. My main concern is that most people won't be willing to wear glasses on their face all the time. Even if they make them contact lenses form, no one would want that, actually it'll be worse since it's a lot more invasive.  The only form factor I can see that could work is if it's a small device that's attached to you in a noninvasive or in your face way. Maybe on ear? or like in scifi, on your temple?",3주 전,0,

I already have prescription glasses (and my prescription changes every 18 months or so), so I'm not eager to try out the Meta Ray-ban glasses.

Your in a contract agreement were you can only be positive... You remind me of a common Tec reviewer. Beyond 2 is better then this. Like how the cords and battery are not swappable you have to use the one it comes with you know apple stuff...

The main reason I bought them was to connect to my PC and use them for flight simulation in VR — and that’s literally their only decent use. You can’t store movies, there aren’t any real games, Game Pass has terrible lag, and the battery at 90 Hz lasts barely half an hour.  There just aren’t any good apps. When I tried the Vision Pro, at least it had a ton more applications — and you can actually use it like a Mac. But it’s not portable, it costs a crazy amount of money… way more than buying a good gaming laptop or a MacBook Pro.  In my country (Mexico), $3,500 USD is literally the price of a used car. To make things worse, I almost bought the Vision Pro two months ago — I was so close — and thank God I didn’t, because I would’ve had a heart attack finding out that just two months later they released the new M5 version out of nowhere.  I think it’s not that popular yet because people still don’t really know what it’s for — and because it’s way too expensive. But it’s easily a thousand times better than the Meta Quest. I just wish it could connect to a PC — if that were possible, I would’ve bought it a long time ago.",4주 전,0,

While HMDs (AVP, Quest, BSB)  are a means of interfacing with computers in a much more immersive way.  The whole passthrough thing that allows them to function like smart glasses has always been a novelty.  I know no one that uses passthrough on a headset outside of trying it for the first time or some sort of art project.  I feel like it was pushed because back when quest came out it sold headsets (or they thought it did).  They should just let them be different things.

@PortRhouse,"I think the VR/XR space has been moving towards the ""smart glasses"" form factor because companies have just failed to realize the biggest use case for more immersive VR. Immersive VR is not just a smartphone on your face with a fancy HUD like smart glasses are. Sure, it could act as a productivity tool like a phone or laptop, but Immersive VR is primarily a social and entertainment platform. I want to be able to build a whole virtual world for myself not constrained by real world limitations like expensive furniture, real estate, or even the laws of physics. I want to be able to create a highly customizable avatar to represent myself that could be genuinely anything humanoid. Not just a generic metahuman.   People could invite their friends who live far away to hang out in their world, watch TV, play games, or explore other worlds together. It could enable socialization thousands of miles away. It could transcend language barriers. It could give disabled people the ability to walk, hell even fly if they wanted to. It could enable trans or genderfluid people to inhabit a body they actually feel comfortable in when they look in the mirror. It could enable people to experience the wonders of the world when travel is financially out of reach. VRchat may be old, niche, and get a bad reputation. However, it is the perfect example of a VR application with a VERY dedicated, growing, creative userbase. If a social platform like that could be created for a mainstream audience and made available through an easy to use, high quality headset I guarantee you it would take off.

@CyberTekRoom,"I find myself far more intrigued by augmented reality (AR) than virtual reality (VR). While VR has its place in the entertainment and gaming world, AR strikes me as the more practical and transformative technology for real-world applications. The ability to overlay digital information seamlessly onto our physical environment has enormous potential across industries—from education and design to healthcare and field service. Perhaps that’s why we see fewer polished consumer options at the moment; meaningful AR integration requires more complexity and refinement. That said, pricing models like $3,500 for a headset still feel excessive given the current stage of the technology. Just my perspective—but I see AR as the true path forward. Great video as always.",4주 전,0,

They had this idea in their head based on a fake reality that they were building their decisions off of. Full on VR was NEVER the answer. Ever. It is a novelty. Always has been. There's 3 things a new product needs to do at least 2 of to gain adoption. It needs to be more efficient, it needs to replace something we already do and be better than the current version, and it needs to be easy to learn/get involved.  Is VR more efficient? No, you need to tailor everything around the headset like space, trusting the people around you not to mess with you, and making sure everything in your vicinity is basically blind person proof. Is it better than what we currently have? In some ways sure, but a lot of people prefer just gaming on a tv or multi tasking with an iPad and phone. And is it easy to get involved? No, you can't pick up and play, it's a whole extra investment for something not that intuitive, it's not that simple.

I'm glad they're letting us use the PSVR 2 controllers now, but they need to work with Valve to get SteamVR working on Apple Silicon so we don't need to use a 3rd Party app on a Windows or Linux machine to do PCVR.

It wouldn’t take much for people to have it be the next have to have for sideline seats to every sports event. $300 a month is low for sports fan who want those kinds of experiences and the AVP can deliver that with higher quality.

Throwing a new chip in it doesn’t do much, but they are doing it because the older CPUs will be phased out and they want to be able to advertise “powered by M5!”. Apple hates admitting mistakes and loves overcharging for them. If they really cared about what people wanted, they would’ve given them a normal head strap to start, got rid of the stupid heavy glass and screens no one likes, focused more on comfort and lightness, and put in a slight hint of effort into support for games which ironically is thriving for other vr headsets.

@DatDude923,"Marques, here’s a real world review on an almost daily use case from an owner. I do have some caveats. - I love Apple products - I own a couple tech companies - been doing VR for over 14 years  OK with that out of the way on a scale of one to 10 based on the competition, I feel that the Apple Vision Pro gets a solid 8… in its current form. I believe it or not. I believe the only way to get it to a 10 (it pains me to say this) is if another company made the software.  I’m gonna be straight up Apple did some great things with the Vision Pro. But just like with iOS, Apple’s gonna tell you what they’re gonna do. For example, we don’t get videos on our lock screens. Why? Because Apple has to protect us from ourselves and battery usage instead of giving us the choice. Can we put the icons anywhere? No, they have to be in a grid. Stuff like this drives me nuts about Apple but there’s a new one for the Apple Vision Pro… native, and snake oil 😬.  Apple gives us the ability to install all iOS and iPadOS apps on our vision pros… but the fine print is the developer has to opt in. So yes, on a plane I can watch anything from Disney+. But the content that I consume daily is on YouTube. Google opted it out so we can’t even put the iPad app on the Vision Pro. Why does this matter? I pay for YouTube so I would like to have downloaded items ready. What’s my work around? Download them on my iPad and share my iPad screen to my headset. Ugh. This is a major pain because I can’t do this with Netflix either.    And then comes the native apps. Come on Apple! A killer app would be going through Apple Maps in complete VR!! how do I know this? Because if you’ve never used Google Earth 14 years ago on the oculus rift, you have no idea what you’re missing. I think Google made the perfect app and I am not a fan of Google at all. You could legitimately grab the sun and move the sun around the Earth and change how things look in real time. You can fly in from orbit and zoom all the way down to street view. This was a phenomenal way of using the Maps. And I think Apple Maps is better so the Fidelity would be better plus we’re using much more powerful chips. But calendar, maps, numbers, etc. are all iPadOS apps. Sure at least they checked the check box to make sure it can be installed on the Apple Vision Pro, but damn I really wish it was native. And immersive.   I use my headset approximately 5 to 7 hours a day for work. I work mobile so I don’t have the luxury of having a really bad ass home set up. But when I’m on the road, I whip out my laptop and have a massive screen. I don’t go with the Ultra Wide but I do go with the wide screen and that’s perfect for anything that I need to do on my laptop. However, I wish I didn’t have to take out my laptop. I wish I could have the experience from my laptop inside the headset because I have more space to work with.    Now it sounds like Samsung’s product will work with all mobile apps. I can’t stress enough how amazing this is. For example, gaming. I have some iPadOS games that are installed in the headset and all I have to do is turn on my headset and take my PlayStation five controller and now I’m gaming. However, Fortnite is now available for the iPadOS…. But I can’t play it in the headset so what do I do? Loaded up on my iPad and share my iPad screen. Totally unnecessary, but it works. What about Call of Duty®? Talk about an amazing experience inside the headset. But the developer opted out. It seems like Samsung won’t have this issue. People have no idea until it hits the market how amazing the Samsung product is going to be for gaming. Now imagine once these headsets start having PlayStation five level chips inside of them…. You literally have a console on your face where you can play in 8K pretty much anywhere. And don’t even get me started on the Apple Intelligence versus Google’s or anybody else’s. I feel like Apple’s product had a two year on the market head start, and is gonna lose it immediately.   Do I watch movies on my headset? Every now and then, but I consume more YouTube than any other media.   Sidenote, I picked up another headset from my wife, and when I’m out of town, we still watch our shows together just remotely on the headset and she loves it… but after a couple, our long shows, she is done with the weight of the headset. I don’t notice it because I guess since I’ve been doing it for 14 years, I developed the muscle muscles that are needed to not feel the weight. I don’t know. I’ve never had issues with weight from headsets and I’ve owned every quest and every rift on my way to the Apple Vision Pro.  But anyway, that’s my honest review, and I’m a fanboy. Lol. I might pick up the other strap, but as of right now I feel like Apple’s dropping the ball on the software. But I still give it a solid eight out of 10 for experience I wanted to rate and lower, but I felt like that’s not accurate. That’s just my emotion. lol. I don’t know if you read these but let me know what you think.",4주 전,0,

There are so little people using VR/AR for productivity that the market share might as well be nonexistent. PICO and Meta makes feature full headsets at a fraction of the price of an Apple Vision that the only thing Apple can offer is their ecosystem. If apple really want their headset to be taken serious they should make a slimmed down version that is made with entertainment in mind. But sadly that’s not the way apple makes things.",4주 전,0,

I mean, I get the social stigma stuff (and that's real - I've brought my Quest on the last couple flights I've taken and the flights have been so packed, I just didn't feel comfortable pulling it out). But the capabilities these headsets have should be making developers salivate. Everyone knows the holy grail of VR is essentially to create Westworld. If they accomplish that, it would literally be the biggest social advancement since AT LEAST social media, if not ever. But it feels like even knowing that, development is still contingent on people embracing VR wholesale in the interim and that feels like a foolish strategy. Most adults aren't gamers, so expecting them to adopt what right now is essentially gaming technology before the more mainstream offerings are available is unrealistic. I know plenty of people who would love to enter The Matrix but aren't going to prime themselves with Gorilla Tag or Beat Saber for a couple years while what they want is being developed. I think this tech is one of the few examples where you need to build it out FIRST and then the market will respond.

If I was wealthy I’d certainly buy one just to play with though.   I still believe the potential is huge but making that a reality is quite different.   For example:   - watching a live sport event as if you’re in the stadium. And sat eight next to your friends with photorealistic avatars - maybe going to historical sites like the colosseum in Rome, but when wearing it everyone walking past looks like they’re in Roman times and you can go and watch an event as it would have been originally.  - just being able to hang out with friends rather than a video call.   I know for some of these types of things people will say it sounds very sad to not have actual in person interaction but be seeing your friends they if h a virtual world. I agree if that’s all you do. But also for people who live busy lives and live far away from their family and friends it could be such an amazing experience.   It just still even now feels very far away. Having photorealistic avatars is possible now but not realistic for the masses, and of course these headsets are extremely expensive for most people.   But I do think the potential is huge especially for live entertainment that you’d watch on tv/video instead such as concerts, sport etc. or even just watching movies.   I do wonder how this kind of tech will go over the next 10-20 years, but I do think we are minimum 10 years away from the kinds of thing I said being widely adopted.",4주 전(수정됨),0,

This just ends up making the glasses look super clunky. Why not have all of the compute and battery for the smart glasses in something you can put in your pocket and just a magnetic connector that can snap onto either arm?

The cost would increase a tiny bit but honestly it doesn’t matter as much to the sales of this product for apple currently anyway. It won’t affect apple financially right now anyway. But it could have possible (low chance) but possible future benefits if it somehow enables something or the experience ends up being better as a result. Developers get on board easier or they have more overhead to not create as much of an optimised app (reality). Specially for a small customer base (though a wealthy one). They would have to upgrade the battery size too. Offer two battery size options. The regular one and the newer one. Or just the newer one. Whatever works out. It’s an opportunity cost. The nba deal is great (although i’m not a fan of exclusive deals). A super fast high bandwidth and stable connection for their laptop/desktop to these, alongside a higher resolution and an even faster frame rate would have been epic.

@JoeSanta,"If Apple wants Vision Pro to evolve toward a Ray-Ban Meta form factor, they need to rethink the system architecture. Right now everything—compute, sensors, displays, power, cooling—is packed into the headset. Instead, Apple could split it into two parts: lightweight glasses for displays and cameras, plus a pocket or belt-mounted compute/power module (or leverage the iPhone). A dedicated ultra-low-latency wireless link, something in the 60 GHz+ range, could stream high-bandwidth video both ways with predictive buffering to mask any delay.  That would drop face weight, heat, and bulk while keeping performance. It also makes the platform modular: swap the compute pack every few years, keep the glasses. It won’t reach true “sunglass” scale until micro-LED waveguides, compact eye-tracking, and dense batteries mature—but this hybrid setup is the only practical path to getting Vision closer to that Ray-Ban-level comfort",4주 전,0,

You can look back into gaming history and see plenty of tricked out high end systems like Neo geo which was basically arcade level quality in your home. Others like phillips and 3d0. They failed because their system didn't have any games worth buying. Which is why Meta is killing the VR market right now over everything, Pc, psvr2, apple vision. Whoever gets the games and makes it easy to play will win this fight. If apples goal was to sell these $3500 systems to influencers to get some hype then they succeeded. Meanwhile Meta's sales at $500 and lower are in the millions per edition. The meta 1 sold million, as did the meta2, and the meta 3 is outselling them all.

@dreamburn1,"⁠​⁠ @DrewMiller1 I agree with half your point. Every MacBook Pro I buy, every 5-7 years, is a $3500 ""pro"" device. This Vision product is meant to supplement a laptop/phone/etc, or provide new entertainment, collaboration, and gaming options. My point is that laptops aren't a new invention that they are hoping people will adopt. When you buy a MacBook Pro, you aren't rolling the dice that it will be useful, or supported by developers, and won't fade away like the Newton or the Pippin.  What good is the new collaboration experience if too few people can share in that collaboration experience? What good is Vision Pro ping-pong, if there's nobody to play ping-pong with? It's just too expensive, for people who don't have disposable income, to perform the non-pro functions that you can get with a meta-quest for 1/7 the price.  I don't think Apple is hurting for income. I think it would be smarter for them to make this device more attainable so that more people will adopt it and it will not fail altogether.",4주 전(수정됨),3,

But more like... hey, if there was a device like the Virtual Reality displays the Juassic Park doctors were using, what would it need to do to work? Ok, let's work on solving those problems and see what people do with the tech. Some of it will be for high level R&D tasks like that, classic Tony Stark manipulating 3D objects in space to fix things. And some of it will be as authoring devices for lower end devices.

@heroninja1125," @G44052  Probably the really terrible bra-shaped ""smart case"" that doesn't actually protect the headphones and is fairly cumbersome, and is required just to put the headphones into deep sleep mode. Imagine if the airpods max case was even half the quality of the cases they give to the airpods and airpods pro. Or, you know, put a button on the headphones that let you sleep them manually, or manually sleep the headphones from the phone software.  Also, there seems to be really bad condensation issues on the airpods max, even when you don't go outside in humid or rainy weather, condensation has a tendancy to build up underneath the aluminum, a unique problem of metal headphones that they did not account for, and it erodes the circuits destroying the headphones. This is incredibly odd coming from the company that is capable of making hermetically sealed personal diving computers marketed as smart watches. I'd figure they would be better at dealing with water/sealing, even the macbooks made out of aluminum do not have this issue.",4주 전,1,

It’s more like a Vision Pro 1s, just like the iPhone 4s and 5s, it’s a spec bump, a big one, but same form factor, no hardware changes, no new features. It’s not a design change.

The camera isn't that heavy, and I can live without the hand-tracking video system; the virtual keyboard is inconvenient anyway. Gaming with glasses is also unnecessary, considering how many dongles and pairing time it requires. Leave me the wristband with a tiny domino touchpad on the pendant for navigation, if your führer-Zuckerberg bought all the rights to muscle tracking. A small credit-card-sized Bluetooth keyboard is enough for me to type. Or split it into two controllers on wristbands. I HATE sluggish, slow body-tracking, ever since the XBOX 360. Give users something they'll actually use, not something that makes you look pretentious.",4주 전(수정됨),0,

@askeladden450," @Dindonmasker  why would you pay 10 times more for a product and still 'have to find ways to make stuff work'? Quest is not a game console either.
