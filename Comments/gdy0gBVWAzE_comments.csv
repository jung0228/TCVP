@carsonhenderson,"Hey I'm a submariner on a Virginia class submarine. I just wanted to say that you made a great video but you made it seem like all American submarines have blue crew and gold crews. That's reserved only for Ohio class submarines. Virginia, Los Angeles, and Seawolf class submarines have the same crew year round. No blue or gold crews. This, combined with the fact that nuclear capable submarines are not necessarily welcomed or desired in foreign ports (because nuclear missiles) means that non Ohio class submarines are the only ones that pull into foreign ports. So that's the trade-off between being a fast attack or a Boomer/guided missile sub. More time off on an Ohio, but more port calls on a Virginia/fast attack.  Let me know if you have any questions, I have lots of cool stories and info about nuclear power and submarines if you're interested to hear.

@doctorscoot,"The references are great!    Two things about boats that I think you missed: 1. Sonar. There is also ‘passive’ sonar which is basically a high tech underwater microphone (a hydrophone) you use to listen for other boats. And 2. Missions — one of the MOST useful things a non missile boat might be tasked with is surveillance. A good quality boat (especially a diesel electric boat) with an expert crew can get into all sorts of places no other assets can be deployed. Well inside other countries’ maritime boundaries. From there you can deploy divers and other operators onto the shore, or just spend some time listening to radio traffic or other activities.   Also, you should have mentioned that a submarine is the ONLY type of capital vessel in a navy which you should ever refer to as a ‘boat’.",6년 전,6,

@georgemonnatjr.172," @tuonglanpham1333  Hello, I spent 4 years in the SSN 639 submarine.  The toilets were stainless steel with two valves, a typical outside sprinkler/hose valve to turn to add water to the bowl and a large ball valve to open the bottom for gravity flush.  The waste drops into the sanitation (SAN) tank.  Later, when it's near full and the situation allows, high-pressure air is used to blow the contents of the SAN tank out of the submarine.  What's really bad is if the SAN tank is pressurized, and you open a toilet's ball valve.  The contents will be blown up and into your orifices.",5년 전,1,

Couldn't the captain release compressed air into the sub, till the air pressure reaches, say, 150 PSI? This would be equivalent to the pressure at a depth of about 300 feet.... allowing the captain to safely exceed crush depth by this amount - more or less. Once the enemy has retreated, the sub could surface and take all the time it needs to decompress to normal atmospheric pressure.",3년 전,0,

Except for the fathometer, which gives you depth beneath the keel: the only real navigation truth anyone has.  The US has 2000 deployed warheads by treaty, with 450 on ICBMs.  This leaves 1550 divided amongst a dozen or so subs.  It's a lot less than 24*8 per ship, at least without a lot of shell games.

@silviashefa4097,"Playing in a Nuclear Sandbox The AUKUS Nuclear Submarine Deal, in which the US and the UK will sell nuclear submarine building technologies to Australia so it can build its own nuclear subs, has made big waves over the past two weeks. There has been much ado over France taking offense with Australia for walking out of a nearly done deal with it to buy similar technology. A lot of money is involved, but pride is more a factor here than money. The frightening thing here is not the nuclear submarines themselves, but the fact that the parties are behaving like kids in a sandbox squabbling over a toy shovel. But in this case, it is a nuclear toy, and the ramifications of these games will impact all eight billion of us. The bad news is that you cannot stop this madness. If you don’t have nuclear subs, you are powerless and cannot stop those who have them. If you do have nuclear subs, you are powerful and you don’t want to stop. If an alien came to Earth and watched what is going on here, it would say that our only interest in life is war-games. Moreover, war defines our life here, and the fact that we could end our existence at the press of a button is no one’s concern as long as we can keep playing. In the 1950s, Baal HaSulam wrote that if humanity doesn’t understand that we cannot live in such a state indefinitely, that we must shift to a considerate way of life where we are responsible for one another, then more world wars will follow and teach us the hard way. “If the total ruin that [nuclear and hydrogen bombs] are destined to bring upon the world is still not evident to the world, they can wait for a third world war, or a fourth one. The bombs will do their thing, and the relics who remain after the ruin will have no other choice but to take upon themselves this work where both individuals and nations will not work for themselves more than is necessary for their sustenance, while everything else they do will be for the good of others,” he wrote in The Writings of the Last Generation. In the 1950s, everyone was still in shock by the devastation that Little Boy and Fat Man inflicted on Hiroshima and Nagasaki (respectively). But eighty years down the line, the possibility of another nuclear episode seems increasingly plausible. Those two monster bombs may have shocked the world then, but they are nothing compared to the nuclear arsenal that countries have developed since. Moreover, so many countries already possess nuclear weapons that I am not even sure if or how many of us will survive a nuclear world war. The options are clear and simple: Unite, or the Earth will explode. If we consider the level of animosity among nations, ethnicities, cultures, religions, or even among regular people, it seems impossible to unite. But this is so only because we are letting our baleful egos drive us to this state. We can decide to let another attitude drive us, a more responsible and considerate one. If we think only of ourselves, there is no question that a total collapse is just a matter of time. Now that we are approaching it, we can see where we are going and change course. We can determine that we have learned the lesson and start looking at the needs of the entire society as well as our own. No one says we need to go hungry or deny ourselves the things we need. But if we all strive to take as much as possible rather than as much as we need, we will end up having nothing. Caring for the well-being of the collective, as well as for our own, is neither an altruistic approach nor an impractical one. It is, in fact, the only realistic and practical approach. This is the only tactic that will allow us to avoid a war that will destroy humanity.",4년 전,0,

@cody1429,"Some things are wrong. The depth is wrong (which you acknowledged) because the real depth is classified, submarines have switched to the 8 hour days but that does not mean they get 16 hours of free time (used to run on 6 hour cycles). You have 8 hours of watch, 8 hours is off going which is for doing collateral duties, maintenance, quals, and maybe a chance to relax or workout if youre lucky, 8 hours to sleep which you will almost never get, usually get about 3-4 sometimes less. The food is mostly better because they are cooking for a smaller crew. Try being on an aircraft carrier where the crew is cooking for 1000's of people. You mentioned ballistic missile subs may swap crews in allied ports which is false. Ballistic missile subs can only pull into american ports (part of what sucks about being on an SSBN is not being able to see the world). I think that incorrect statement stems from you not mentioning Guided Missile Submarines which also have 2 crews and are the same exact sub as a Ballistic Missile Sub but dont have ballistic missiles, and they can swap crews in allied ports (Florida and Georgia swap in Diego Garcia all the time).

@gmodlocus7309,"im just saying monkey subs are really effective, i very much like the ballistic missile upgrade as it does extra damage to MOAB and ceramic balloons with unlimited range, meaning that (like the heli) it will always attack the furthest in the track. they are comparable to sniper monkeys as they have unlimited range but with a much higher fire rate, and a lot cheaper. One strategy I have is to place a ton of monkey subs in a larger pool of water (usually closest towards the back of the track) and because they are so cheap, the pool is filled up quickly, I then have a sub commander in the middle of the cluster to give AP to the other subs, and the rest of the subs will have ballistic missiles. While this is cheap to set up at the begging, the upgrades to add up in cost, making it more effective to just place a super monkey down, it is still fun to gawk at the shear amount of subs that you can cram into a small area, especially because they overlap, having subs stacked on top of each other.

The UK has Port(red) crew and Stbd(Green) crew for two crew boat but we have a Single Crew system called Gold crew and is for boats going into refit.   Food is not better on a UK sub much worse than surface fleet and they get the same money as surface fleet but cannot get fresh food. The best day for food on a boat is the last day, called day zero where you get a massive all you can breakfast meal.   The UK have either 6 hours on 6 hours off for warfare crew.  Engineering Normally do the old shifts called 3's and 4's. 3 on 8 off etc. No days off for 3 months.   Sharing bunks is getting less and less in UK subs with better automation but its not for engineers. Its called hot bunking.   Whilst on patrol each submariner gets 120 words from friends and family a week.   HMS Vanguards crash cost £135 million to repair.

One of the cooks on the boat I was one was from New Orleans and made some damn good gumbo and jambalaya. Another one of the cooks worked at a mom and pop pizza joint in New York. And one other was just really good at baking. I made good friends with the night baker while we were on patrol, so he'd typically let me eat cookies fresh from the oven. And since I was midrats crank for a while he'd let me make my own omelettes before the rest of the crew came in to eat.

@pdoylemi,"I enjoyed this - a tad simplistic, but accurate. But as a former submariner, I am probably a bit too critical. But the part about the stealth is not exaggerated. Even in he 80s when the 688 class boat was the premier fast attack sub, we ran a training exercise with the Brits just off the coast of South Carolina. We had 6 American and 3 British frigates and destroyers assigned to find us in a square 90 kilometers on a side. Our job was to take out as many of them as we could in three days. Using dud torpedoes we got 7 of them. Near the end of the 3rd day, our captain began heading home, but he got cocky - he came to scope depth and saw that it was thick fog about 9 miles out, so he surfaced right between two frigates that were only operating navigational radars, which would not be likely to pick us up - just to rub in our victory. But 4 miles out there was a break in the fog, and we were spotted and ""killed"". So technically we lost the engagement - I wonder what the group commander said to our captain! Still, they never laid a glove on us submerged, and we ran with our conning tower about the surface for 4 miles before they caught us. We had a saying back then that I suspect is mostly still true - there are two kinds of ships - subs, and targets.",6년 전,0,

I clicked on this to see if you would explain; but probably what I'm talking about is not allowed to be discussed huh?,5년 전,0,
@briansonnenfelt7125," @mannonmission1  we dive by opening main ballast tank vents, allowing the air in the tanks to vent. The air is replaced by water, submerging the ship. You can find videos of subs submerging on YT. The large column of water you see in actually air escaping thr tanks. Surfacing is more complicated and complex, using a low pressure air blower to pump air into the tanks forcing the water out. As long as the vents on to remain shut, the air will force out the water via grates on the bottom of the ship. EMBT blow is done with compressed high pressure air that is forced into the tanks via the EMBT blow system, which is a much faster way to get water out obviously. The biggest difference is we cannot submerge again until the EMBT blow Airbamks are within specification, which takes several hours, vice you can rapidly submerge again if needed from a normal surface procedure. Hope that kinda explains it for you.",5년 전(수정됨),0,
@mannonmission1," @briansonnenfelt7125  thank you.  Your explanation is simple and easy to follow (except for EMBT which only a sub sailor would understand). I was a sub sailor from 1970 to 1974.

The emergency blow system, firsts introduced on the Sturgeon class (I was aboard the 1st of its class, the USS Queenfish, to be commissioned).

@stumpedII,well .. i think i could head up to control.. if we had speed.. and drive to the surface.. at which point i'd grab a life jacket or 2.. some food and water.. and jump out the control room hatch and pray i missed the propellers. fortunately its so remotely possible.. that my nighmares did not include that.. the nighmare i had was backsliding due to flooding  possibly like what the thresher crew experienced..  and watch the depth guage..   thinking about my family and wondering if it will hurt much (like being inside a giant desiel engine cylinder on it's compression stroke.. no spark.  uses compression to raise temp by squeezing.. and that ignites the fuel).. walking dead scary stuff.. another way i wouldnt want to go is KAL 007  where the russians blew the wing off the plane (probably spying for the cia) that flew over or near one of their sub? bases.. and it took 15 min to hit the water.. but it might have spun so fast people lost conciousness..     then the space shuttle challenger where that soft puff uncontained explosion of the primary fuel tank gently pushed the shuttle away.. albiet in peices.. so it could free fall back to the ocean (another 15 min fall)  15 min where the astronauts safely tucked into their comfortable seats were very much alive an concious all the way down.. thinking or saying shit god d*** it.. why didnt they put a parachute on this thing.  dying in a sub at depth is probably the last wy i'd want to go.. rather be eaten by a shark i think.  but not a python..,6년 전,0,

@scottwhitley5542,"Hi friends. Have you ever thought about where you'll spend eternity? It's the most important question you will ever consider. We have all broken God's moral law - the 10 commandments. This is also why we need Jesus Christ as our personal Savior. Can I ask you some questions my friend? How many lies have you told in your life? What do we call someone who tells lies? Have you ever stolen something? What do we call someone who steals? A thief. Have you ever taken God's name in vain (omg)? God said He will not hold harmless those who misuse His name. Jesus said if a man even looks at a woman with lust in his heart then he's already committed adultery with her in his heart. Have you ever looked with lust my friend? This is just 4 out of the 10 commandments that we have broken. Since we have broken God's moral law, we deserve to be separated from God forever in hell. But God in His love sent His Son Jesus to die for my sin and your sin my friend. To have your sins forgiven and have eternal life place your faith in Jesus just like you would a parachute when having to jump out of an airplane at 30,000 feet. You can't just believe in the parachute you have to place your faith in it by putting it on. After you pray to receive Jesus read John 3 and 4. Then read the Bible every single day of your life no matter what and also pray that God will help you understand what you read. Please, please, please think about this my friend. Judgment is coming and this is how you get prepared.",6년 전,0,

(enlisted)  their training is 2 years of school (prob like getting a masters degree in 2 years)  and constant abuse and pressure right up till their enlistment is up.  the good news tho is try to excell .. bear with it.. triump.. and be the best .. especially when it comes to qualificaitions..   because a civilian industry.. that will treat you really really nice.   including a much higher paycheck awaits you.  nukes who remain in the service must have something wrong with their heads.,6년 전,0,

Some of the food is just crap.. like the steaks.. worst..  they must have been cutter canner grade.. or road kill or old dairy cows that died of old age.. every ny strip i ate.. on a sub.. and something .. infestations.. somethign that was not meat.. and you needed a hatchet not a dinner knife to cut.. so gross.. i woudlnt eat the steaks.  the hamburgers were 50% soy.. and well google soy to see the theorys on hormone interference associated with soy.. but at least you could eat the ""sliders"".  the best meals were thanksgiving.. turkey potatos cranberries and a lot of them.. damn that was good.. and the breaded shrimp.. OMG all you can eat shrimp!  lobster was ok but infrequent (surf and turf) pizza every friday.  breakfast menus always the same.. if you could eat (plastic(dehydrated)) eggs sausage and bacon you wouldnt starve to death)  then the best meal of all for when a politician or admiral visited the sub.. KING CRAB LEGS! .. but other than xmas you probably wouldnt see much of that.  you missed one perk tho.. submarine pay and sea pay.. used to be  a tiny stipend..  but now they can get to be quite a substantial part of your pay.. (reason is they allowed the base pay to wither and almost die cus that's what your retirement is based on, yep they saved a lot of money screwing the retirees) (so don't think for a second it's a good deal for anyone who sticks around for 20) .. another kind of perk is .. when you deploy on a boomer.. before you go.. you can get advanced pay.. yep.. ~7 paychecks all at once  then when you get back your normal pay resumes.. and  while on the sub you don't have to spend a dime (unless you gamble?) or run out of cig.   cig's went for 5 -7 dollars a pack if you ought a carton back then (before deployment at a base exchange) (when i first joined it was 50Cents a pack)  but if you buy a pack on patrol .. cus you didnt bring enough plan on spending at least 10x the normal cost or  higher..   best thing is to just quit smoking.. which i did after i left the service.. probably could have bought a car or house for what i have spent on a designer drug that only kills you.  stupid to smoke..

@stumpedII,submarines are like blimp plane mixture.  sub can hover.. mkae it's own weight (by controling tanks and how full they are) the same as the sea water it displaces.. so it hovers in the water.. neither rise nor sink..   or it can FLY thru the water.. with stunted wings  (called planes) which use aero (hydro) dynamics to create lift and turn the sub   the whole sub itself becomes a plane when in the water (like a giant flying wing) and the planes on the sides of the sub change the angle of that great big plane.. if your using motion thru the water to maintain depth (plane mode not blimp mode)   the big difference between an actual plane and a sub is there are 2 pilots.. and there aer more than just the two pilots in general operation of the sub.. but 2 guys at steering wheels..   not 1 .. and the sub responds slower to directions of it's planes..  LOT OF MASS to change it's direction or speed etc..  you could say there are more than 2 people in the driver seat of a submarine.  all sharing some what the responsibility's of say a car driver.

@_EVANERV_,"The typhoon class of submarines also have a small video arcade in a green space made up of fake plants and fake grass carpeting. Sharing the adjacent space is an airtight smoking room that is able to compress the smoke and vent it when they surface. Out of the original 6 Typhoons built 5 are scrapped while only one is still in active duty, and it is serving as a missile testing platform. Also, speaking of new submarine detection methods, some of the newer russian submarines have this strange sniffer device mounted to the front of their subs' conning towers. Though the sniffer's functions are not officially disclosed, many theorize that the sniffer is designed to pick up the extremely faint radiation signals other nuclear subs leave in the water. And the odd looking devices may have the capacity to determine radiation signals from different class of subs or maybe even individual subs.",6년 전(수정됨),0,
@atigerclaw,"""Luckily they were going at low speed and there were no injuries...But, considering both of these subs were both equipped with nuclear warheads, one can only imagine the potential consequences of a more damaging collision.""  Yeah.  They both sink and implode.  Nothing else happens except maybe the screaming of trapped men.  Nukes cannot go off by being 'damaged'.  That is a movie myth that needs to stop being perpetuated.  Oh look.  I mirrored another, similar comment.  I'd be less concerned with the impact of the nuclear weapons, and more concerned with the live nuclear reactor that powers the sub.  And even then, radioactive heavy metals tend to have a higher density than water and like to sit on the bottom, thousands of feet below the moving currents.  And water is, astonishingly enough, used as a radiation shield.  The ocean, the best radiation shield in the world.

@commandershepherd8987,"I feel like you're downplaying how bad life on a carrier truly is a little bit. We worked 12 hour shifts, sometimes longer, with give or take 12 off, 7 days a week. There were zero days off for the entire 7 month deployment we had on the Truman. I dont really count port calls, because you still have 1 out of those 4 days that you have duty and cant leave the ship. To add to that, it was common to wait in lines that stretched through all 3 hangar bays, pretty much the length of the ship, for up to 9 hours before even getting a chance to leave the boat. So adding all the time lost up, it boils down to maybe a day and half total every 45 days. The quality of life on a carrier is absolute SHIT. The only thing worse about being on a sub is that you share your rack with someone else.  The food is straight garbage, the ship itself is fucking disgusting, and you will NEVER have any alone time. 10/10 worst experience of life at sea hands down.

@stumpedII,it stinks too when they blow sanitary tanks.  to get the poop off the ship.. they have to pressureize the tanks that hold the poop.. then open a valve to allow the higher pressure tank to dump to sea..  well the only thing on the inside of the sub keeping those pressureized poop tanks from dumping IN the sub.. are the toilet flush handles..  great big heavy metal bars.. going tot he base of the toilet.. where they attach to a huge metal ball with a big hole in it.. push/pulling the bar lines the hole up to the tank or blocks it..   if you open that hole while the tanks are pressureized to dump poop  to sea.. you get hit by high pressure wave of shit and piss and toilet paper.. it gets everywhere.. eyes nose.. mouth. the whole stainless steel bathroom covered in shit and piss.. and guess who has to clean that up?  sure htey hang signs.. blow in progress.. and the toilets themselves are boiling furiously (not perfectly air tight)  but.. if you realize how tired some submariners get.. its understandable that once every few years someone pulls that handle without thinking.. and then SHIT HAPPENS!.,6년 전,0,

@petersmythe6462, @bestamerica  how is water too heavy on a submarine? A submarine is literally exactly as dense as seawater. Submarines are heavier than buildings of the same volume.  I agree splashing would be an issue. But that pretty much shouldn't happen except in an emergency dive can or surface. Normal movements of a submarine are necessarily relatively calm and quiet. Presumably they don't swim while the submarine is leaping out of the water like a shark because the water will splash everywhere.,5년 전(수정됨),1,

@Maadhawk,"As a vet of the US Navy and someone who served on submarines, I want to point out that we can actually get people off the boats for family emergencies provided the military situation is stable to permit it. I have seen this done first hand when I served aboard a vessel. For the privacy of my former shipmate I won't say what vessel.   Food we get on submarines is also not as good as you think. They say we get better food, but I have seen the crates arrive on the pier stamped with rejections by both the Air Force and the US penal system. What did we do? We stowed it onboard. As you noted, fresh food doesn't last that long. So a point in time comes that the fresh food runs out fairly fast. A submarine doesn't have the luxury of underway replenishment at sea. Target, I mean surface ships do. So in the grand scheme of things they have better food over all.  You talk about the blue and gold crews as well. That is for boomer subs only. The Ohio class boats. The Los Angeles, Virginia, and Sea Wolf class ships are all fast attack boats designed to project sea superiority, commerce raiding, covert operations, and littoral operations. Those vessels only have one crew who is responsible for the boat at all times.",6년 전,0,

LA class (only ones i can remember) fast attacks seemed sad in size.. one thing i'm thankfull for.. actually 2 things.. is 1. fast attacks can go out as long as we do.. but they weren't built to go out that long thus they hot bunk..   and 2.. boomers it seems go to higher states of war on patrol..  that the ssns do not..   so boomer sub sailors qualify to join veterans of foreign wars.. while the ssn guys cannot join.. unless they were in a hot war.  boomers are at war.. while on station.  cold war?  .. i thought that cool.. but.. when it comes down to it.. i wouldn't mind drinking a few beers with my fellow submariners regardless of which type they were on..   single boomer sailors get advance pay too.. up to 7? paychecks..  and boomers get R&R too..

They are also going to deploy a low yield variant the W76-4 which is supposed to be below 10 kt. Also nukes don't go off by accident such as in a collision. They just don't. You can pour gasoline on warhead, ignite it and start working it with a hammer. At worst you will trigger the conventional explosives and destroy the room and spread core material.

@stumpedII,that sucked for the crew that survived the inital blast.  cus sub rescue could have probably saved them.. but .. russians have a hard time admitting mistakes disasters or asking for help.  personally i appreciate the thought of sub rescue.. but  i think it's there for hope.. like obama hope.. you cant eat it.. it wont save your life.. you cant sell it.. you cant really do anything with hope.. cept die with a smile on your face.  I think that the odds that  something will happen to a us submarine where the crew is recoverable is very very slim.  It's just there for the smile effect.,6년 전,0,

@emmedigi89,"Actually, you omitted to say that the main role of attack submarines is to track and sink SSBNs. Not only to attack surface targets. This may have become true in the recent past after the Cold War, when Virginia Class, 3rd generation Akula and Severodvinsk class submarines were issued as multirole platforms in order to launch cruise missiles too and perform intelligence activities. But, in a period of crisis between two superpowers, the duty of an SSN is to track and sink an enemy SSBN before it can launch its missiles. Additionally, given the role that carriers have in NATO strategy, Russian SSNs have also the duty of sinking carriers. But this is also accomplished by a particular class of submarines that can be found only in the Russian navy and was specifically conceived in the role of anti-carrier warfare, su as the Oscar-class subs.",6년 전,0,

A destroyer is not as silent and can be detected by planes, radars and other ships and attacked from air and sea. Furthermore, being silent means that you can listen better.

Anything capable of actually reaching pluto would be so visible it would be spotted easily. Anything capable of interstellar travel would be visible from several lightyears away.  The biggest problem in space is thermal management. That is, how do you get rid of waste heat. And while there are ways of doing so, dumping waste heat from a non-trivial power source would make you VERY visible.  Sure a submarine with a nuclear reactor produces a lot of power, but this is still pretty unimpressive compared to the power levels that would be required for an interstellar starship. Plus, a submarine can dump it's heat directly into water, which has an extremely high thermal mass, and thus will quickly dissipate the heat with little obvious effect.  In space, your only long term option is to radiate the heat away, and this will be visible over huge distances.  So no. Space warfare will not resemble submarine warfare...",6년 전,0,

While they made carriers for this purpose, it was quickly very clear that the carriers themselves had become the main armement of a fleet and that all other ships were only there for support.",6년 전,0,

@Platyfurmany,"1 minor edit I would suggest about rescue subs is this: the vast majority of the regions of the oceans where submarines actually spend 99% of their time are much, much deeper than the ""crush"" depth of any military submarine.  Even along some places on continental shelves, the depths greatly exceed the crush depth of a submarine.  Take, for instance, the USS Thresher, following a post-shakedown inspection and recertification, was doing a series of test dives just over 200 miles east of Cape Cod.  During one of the test dives, the Thresher apparently experienced an emergency reactor shut down (scram) which prompted the captain to order an emergency blow to surface the submarine.  Long story short, the emergency blow couldn't take place and the submarine, without power, sank towards the seafloor.  It is estimated that the Thresher imploded 2400 feet deep, 400 feet deeper than its predicted crush-depth.  The wreckage settled to the seafloor at some 8000 feet below sea level.  The point is that unless a submarine is quite close to shore, in waters no deeper than the so-called ""test-depth"" (nowhere near crush-depth), there is no crew alive to rescue!  If there is any consolation to be found in the stories of any of the submarines that sank while in the deep ocean, it is that when the various submarines imploded, it happened way too fast for the crews to ever feel anything.  According to sonar data available at the time, the Thresher imploded in less than 0.1 seconds.  Material source- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Thresher_(SSN-593)#Sinking",6년 전(수정됨),0,

I served on USS HAWKBILL SSN-666, USS ALABAMA SSBN-731, and USS MONTPELIER SSN-765. Over the years that I served on them I did 6's, 8's, and 12's which is known as port & stupid (mostly the later) which is determined by manning, rate, and what platform you are on. My rate was originally called ""stew burner""/mess specialist/culinary specialist. But as you guys know we all have been sleep deprived due to all the other crap we do after watch. Hence, sub pay 😎 I will say this, I loved being at sea with my brothers because we are some crazy MFers. Targets and airdales have nothing on us...sing our song loud and proud. Because we are elite.

Let’s not forget the one hour of “field day”, cleaning, after you got relieved from watch and ate on crews mess.  Many other things as well I can’t get into.  It’s accurate enough.  Serving on the SSN 709, SSN 765, and SSBN 735 for reference.  Close enough, especially the food.

@Vulpes89,Submarine life looks fairly comfortable these days. Certainly in the second world war it looked horrendous on diesel subs. Those vessels had to surface to run diesel engines to charge a battery that allowed them to go underwater for short limited periods. They were cramped like a sardine can and the oxygen system on board was rudimentary and it got hot and humid too fast. They didn't go very deep either.  If anyone wants to see how life in diesel subs was like see the German war film Das Boot. The sailors were keenly aware at all times that they were going about in what was potentially an extremely cramped coffin.,6년 전,87,

@brentgranger7856,"A little expansion on this video from a radioman submariner:  Sharing a bunk on attack submarines (aka ""hot bunking"") is not often 2 sailors sharing a bunk, but 3 sailors sharing 2 bunks. As the narrator says, the typical submarine rotation is an 18 hour day. One sailor is on watch while two others are off to sleep in the bunks. It may sound unsanitary that one might sleep on another's pillow and sheets. However, one (or more) of them will keep his own set of sheets and pillow to just throw on top of the bunk.  As a guy who was an email sensor, I got to learn some personal secrets of the crew. It was not a satisfying job, as I sometimes knew some things that I could not tell my fellow sailor. Operation security is paramount in submarine life, so I also had to ""red flag"" emails from sailors that might give away important mission data such as what we were doing, where we were going, and who was involved in the mission.  Submarine crews can perform underwater escapes similar to the one performed in the film ""Deep Blue Sea."" By pressurizing an escape trunk to sea pressure, an individual can use an inflated hood to rise to the surface, but must continuously exhale to avoid decompression sickness (aka ""the bends""). Dive towers seen in films like ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Down Periscope"" were once used by submariners to simulate a submerged escape.",6년 전,1,
@Shenaldrac,"""But given that these subs are equipped with nuclear weapons, one can only imagine the consequences of a more damaging collision."" Yes, I can imagine. The consequences would be... nothing. Because, you see, the people who build and design nuclear missiles aren't stupid. They know that they are building enormously destructive devices. And they realize that making it so that bumping them could make them go off is a bad idea. So, in fact, nuclear warheads are designed to only work when a very precise number of things happens in the right order. This is why shooting down nuclear missiles is a safe thing to do, because there is very close to zero chance that you will accidentally cause the missile to detonate.",6년 전,350,

(george bush wouldnt take nukes off teh table , shoudl have found him insane and relieved him from his office just by saying that)  but even the president cannot launch if if the ones he gives orders to think it';s an illegal order..  so thank god.. there were even controls on bush.

@McZeez,Submarines store compressed air. These ballast tanks are basically giant steel tanks in the front and back. They open valves on top which allows them to fill with water as air escapes. This makes the ship less buoyant and heavy and it sinks. They can close the valves and fill it with air displacing the water the ship then rises. There are additional tanks used to trim or level the ship. A good Chief of the watch checks and logs these values and adjusts them when necessary.,6년 전,0,

This, combined with the fact that nuclear capable submarines are not necessarily welcomed or desired in foreign ports (because nuclear missiles) means that non Ohio class submarines are the only ones that pull into foreign ports. So that's the trade-off between being a fast attack or a Boomer/guided missile sub. More time off on an Ohio, but more port calls on a Virginia/fast attack.  Let me know if you have any questions, I have lots of cool stories and info about nuclear power and submarines if you're interested to hear.  Edit: I just wanted to reemphasize that you've made a greatly detailed video and I'll be sure to share it with my friends.",6년 전(수정됨),78,

There is also ‘passive’ sonar which is basically a high tech underwater microphone (a hydrophone) you use to listen for other boats. And 2. Missions — one of the MOST useful things a non missile boat might be tasked with is surveillance. A good quality boat (especially a diesel electric boat) with an expert crew can get into all sorts of places no other assets can be deployed. Well inside other countries’ maritime boundaries. From there you can deploy divers and other operators onto the shore, or just spend some time listening to radio traffic or other activities.   Also, you should have mentioned that a submarine is the ONLY type of capital vessel in a navy which you should ever refer to as a ‘boat’.",6년 전,6,

@georgemonnatjr.172," @tuonglanpham1333  Hello, I spent 4 years in the SSN 639 submarine.  The toilets were stainless steel with two valves, a typical outside sprinkler/hose valve to turn to add water to the bowl and a large ball valve to open the bottom for gravity flush.  The waste drops into the sanitation (SAN) tank.  Later, when it's near full and the situation allows, high-pressure air is used to blow the contents of the SAN tank out of the submarine.  What's really bad is if the SAN tank is pressurized, and you open a toilet's ball valve.  The contents will be blown up and into your orifices.",5년 전,1,

@justjustin5798," @georgewest8468  IT WAS A JOKE. TAKE A HINT. OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE NO SUBS IN THE SKY. Flex that you were on a SSGN, SSBN Attack sub or whatever. ITS A JOKE and question what was your MOS and what sub were you on? Just curious and if you were in the navy aren't you suppose to keep quiet about how sub's work because the ENTIRE purpose of a sub is to be stealthy. So if you tell somebody how something secret works wouldn't you be putting the U.S in danger. C'mon now that like the first thing you learn in sub school. In fact while you are on a sub, you can't earn your dolphins unless the crew can trust you. You can be the best sailor but if the crew can't trust you. You can't get dolphins. What crew were you on too? Just asking.",4년 전(수정됨),0,
@georgewest8468," @justjustin5798  My rating when I retired in '76 was RMCS(SS) or E8 Radioman.  I went to several schools for training on radio equipment and crypto equipment operation and maintenance and obtained several NEC's, or Navy Enlisted Codes that match some Army, Airforce MOM'S.   The, other than details about some of the equipment and Nuke operations, the details about sub details are known world wide. As a Radioman handling classified incoming/outgoing message, I and my crew all had Top Secret clearances.        You have a rather twisted view of how we earn our Dolphins.  When we arrive on board we are issued a rather thick booklet that highlights the details of each system that we have to study, memorize, identify their locations and get a signature from the Leading Petty Officer/Chief in charge of the system.  When all of the signatures are done we they sit before a board of officers in their wardroom and are queried on everything we learned.  The process takes about 9 months and you are interviewed by the XO to whom you show your progress. You EARN the coveted Dolphins through hard work and study.       I sailed aboard a diesel sub from '58 to '62 that was built in '44.    I commissioned SSN 607, TDY/TAD aboard the SSN 591 for 7 months, commissioned the SSN 651 and sailed aboard the SSBN 608.  A lot of hard work there, huh?  I didn't have the necessary time to tackle qualifying on the SSN 591.     Ugah, Ugah, Ugah; SURFACE, SURFACE, SURFACE.  My surfaces and dives came out equal. Stay healthy Justin.  Thanks for trading comments.",4년 전,0,

But OTOH maybe most memes are like that, or at least start like that (they are exclusive to the inner circle). I don't usually get annoyed about memes, but somehow this meme feels like it's more about the exclusivity (""haha I'm dropping a hint that might make them even more confused haha"") than the rest of memes, and that bugs me, because I think communication should be clearer and not the other way around.

@PacificEmperor,"Connor Trempe Dictionary.com ""wet"" definition 1. ""moistened, covered, or soaked with water or some other liquid"". By this definition, water, unless covered in some other form of liquid, in it of itself is not wet. Dictionary.com ""wet"" definition 2. ""in a liquid form or state"". By this definition, water, that is the liquid form of H2O, is always wet. Merriam-Webster ""wet"" definition 1. ""consisting of, containing, covered with, or soaked with liquid (such as water)"". This definition supports both arguments. By this definition, water consists of water, so water is wet. In the same definition, water in and of itself is not wet. In the end, the argument is over semantics. Different definitions will lead to different conclusions and arguments become moot.  Merriam-Webster ""fire"" definition 1. ""the phenomenon of combustion manifested in light, flame, and heat"". Merriam-Webster ""burn"" definition 1. ""to consume fuel and give off heat, light, and gases"". So fires are always in a burning state. Fires cannot burn other fires, as in cause a combustion, not because fires are not burned, but because fires are always burning. If we were to apply the same logic to water being wet, then water cannot make water wet, not because water isn't wet, but because water is always wet.
