@En1gmaOSC,"There was so much to unpack in this video and so many gold nuggets of knowledge.  What I knew of David Goggins coming in was that he was a paragon of discipline. I thought he was a master of taking control of his body when his mind and other parts of himself were not wanting to. This was evidenced by his time in the SEALS and the incredibly difficult endurance challenges he subscribed to.  After watching this video, I side with Dr. Huberman in saying that David Goggins is the paragon on internal dialogue and self mastery. The focus and pure internal mastery of the self is beyond remarkable, and I believe that, although he may not think it, that nugget of wisdom is what is going to give people motivation to cut off from mindless noise and get into their mind and bodies and really start having the conversations with themselves that are uncomfortable and painful to have.",5일 전,0,

@aisha6493,"So this dude, he went through struggles and hardships and then he saw an ad for navy seal and applied. They told him hes fat. So he went and flipped his life around, lost 300 pounds in 3 months. Later on set some world records  He has made impressive feats in his career but I don't like how he talks about his struggles as if nobody else on the face of this planet has ever been fat or abused or faced academic hardship, I just think people go through worse things in life and then become successful later in life; the difference is that he knows how to market himself and build a brand out of it  Also, he is not a happy, satisfied, relaxed or peaceful person. Eventually, his all-or-nothing mindset will take such a bad toll on him, and he thinks he's doing all these things and grinding right now so he will be able to maintain this lifestyle. Dude is in his 50s. 20 years later, he will be a fading legend. 50 years later someone will beat his records and have an even more inspirational story. So he is basically running towards and for nothing. This is the thing that bugs me how some men act like theyre indestructible like just chill ur a multimillionaire, what meaning is there in a life of suffering where you are constantly criticising yourself  The podcaster is just reinforcing him like ohhh doing hard things makes ur brain grow. And i was just thinking like these dudes have some hypocrisy like i bet they wouldnt clean their washroom, their toilets wash the dishes, cook their own meals, do their own laundry, etc and then they say do hard things, 'lean into the suck' where the suck is just running till your feet break",13일 전(수정됨),1,

@yayoa,"self notes: 2:01:03 - 2:07:03  it was never about the running, he hates running the most yet he does it every day like he loves it. runs hundreds of miles for days. he lives in that state of suffering and pain because it is what gives him that willlpower to begin. the willpower itself comes from doing the things he hates (not difficult/hard things that he likes to do i.e lifting, but HATES to do), that self-confidence and willpower is built on that foundation and history of things he hates to do that hes done. and that work is hard and its ugly and not fun at all. but that allows him to be able to look at anyone in the eye and know that everything he's being real.  2:08:37 -   :  hes saying first go inwards, then action. he deeply respects his process of introspection, and fullt shutting out any distractions in order to hear his mind. he makes the painter analogy. hes working on the masterpiece that is himself in his head.  that suffering he chooses to go through. its for the voices in his head. its for the voices in his head that say he cant do it, its too hard, he wants to do something else, that wants to give up, that says hes not good enough. after enough of doing the things he doesnt want to do, those voices start being quiet and the ""other"" voice begins to win  he spends time in this introspection every single day. exploring the deepest darkest parts of himself. and its scary. hes extremely intentful with everything he does bc every single day he's looking inwards and seeing whats there, and faces it and acts accordingly. which is why so many people dont understand him, bc most never even begin to try look inward yet he spends every single day in the darkest corner of his mind and making it clean. and its also why hes not ashamed or afraid. he knows who he is  It's amazing that the public defines this person by his willpower and physical prowess. In my opinion, his strength comes from his constant and deep introspection. His self-awareness is remarkable especially when you factor in his disabilities",1개월 전(수정됨),1,

My two sons heard the same podcast and as soon as walking through the door this evening, no hello, only focused, and speaking to this miracle, mindset sealed, and viewing every moment with new eyes, all avenues open to suffer and live forever. Today, I suffered, banished fear, and told myself, if I fall, I will get up and suffer more.  Waiting, hoping for speedy death and peace, told my days were few and prisoner to one room, the ER, only with aid of a walker, and never without aid, I determined I am still alive to know suffering spoken two evening ago. Today, no walker, no wheelchair, in pain and walking, never allowing anyone to give me aid. In pain, no sleep, my body screaming for mercy, I ignored my thoughts, I moved, challenging my every thought, my every action and any nutrition that I allowed, dismissing all else. Purpose, finally the reason I am alive.  Thank you, Andrew Huberman, and David Goggins.",1개월 전,0,

That was special and so deeply appropriate and relevant.  This episode deserves 100M views though 19M and counting is not too shabby.  Like many, I also struggled with bullying and a speech stutter growing up and a fairly limiting home and community environment in many ways. I also served in the military but only a fraction of Goggin’s accomplishments. I’m overcoming and Goggins resonates with me so much as do Huberman’s story and earlier challenges.  Thanks for much for educating and inspiring all of us as to what is possible and how to get there! Like Goggins makes clear it’s on us and our daily decisions and recommitments.  Scott",1개월 전,0,

@فياض-ب3ق,"Discipline is stronger than motivation Goggins emphasized that you cannot rely on motivation; motivation comes and goes. What keeps you consistent is daily discipline, even when you don’t feel like it.  The mind controls the body more than we think He explained that you often reach only about 40% of your capabilities before giving up. When you feel like you are done, you have actually used less than half of your potential.  The power of inner self‑talk Goggins repeatedly says: when fatigue or pressure increases, speak to yourself with clear and strong words. Turn your inner dialogue from negative to challenging and positive: “I can do this. I’m built for this. I will not stop.”  Escaping excuses The discussion highlighted how many people justify their failure with their circumstances. Goggins: “You are the only one responsible for your life. Write down all your excuses and start breaking them one by one.”  Persistence matters more than perfection You do not need to be perfect or have a complete plan. Start with a small step, but never stop.  Understanding the brain under stress (Huberman’s input) Huberman explained how stress and pressure activate specific areas in the brain (the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex) and how training through discipline over time increases mental resilience.  Embracing pain as part of growth Goggins: “Pain is not your enemy; it is your trainer.” Every time you face pain or exhaustion and keep going, your mind builds a new pathway for endurance.  A consistent daily routine He spoke about the importance of a strict daily routine that enforces discipline, such as: Waking up early – intense workouts – reviewing goals – writing notes.",2개월 전,1,

I'm 54 sitting the office surrounded by people and getting emotional as i right this. i've struggled my whole life with learning and processing everything & anything. I do not consider myself inteligent nor intellectual. Reading shit 10 times before it sinks in? that's me man, dyslexia, dyspraxia, struggle socially etc, etc, . Left school with F*** all. Parents immigrated, with me, from England to Ireland and we/i had nothing and i mean nothing! Father an alcoholic (but not violent), mother a manic depressive, no money, no work, no qualifications. Realised 12mths later that if it ain't knocking on my door i gotta go get it.  Went back to school at 21 starting from the ground up. Had to lie about what qualifications I did have just to get started at day release classes and eventually got myself educated, with awards of certifications, degree, charterships and now in a good job, earning well and able to provide a good quality of life for me & for my family. I train several times a week, as I'm immensely motivated to do so no matter what and if i don't you don't wanna listen to my shit. when i don't train i constantly think about my next session.  I'm forever and i mean forever critical of myself and sometimes fall into some dark places, but i get my shit together every time, brush myself down and be thankful that the switch went off. David, you're one f***in inspiration and clarifier of reality of what it actually takes to get on in this life and as you say 'we all know what we gotta do, ya just gotta have the balls, be truthful with yourself and do it' I knew and it took everything and more, but I did it and I get up every day to do it. thank you",2개월 전(수정됨),3,

@mariusxmeier2417,"The funny thing about David Goggins´ whole philosophy and the way he gets promoted is that he is the odd one out. All the respect to him. He has worked himself out of a corner. EVEN THOUGH  1.) He never stresses the community aspect of the seals which must have truly helped him. So, COMMUNITY which a lot of young people are lacking is not mentioned instead all he constantly screams out is ""STAY HARD"". Wow.   2.) For every Goggins there are 1000 people who drowned themselves in alcohol, drugs, any other kind of self destructive substance.   Yes, work hard, but also, give yourself a break when you need to. Get help when you need to. Seek community.",2개월 전,1,
@tomguiney,"Just wanted you guys to know, this episode changed my life. Since I listened to it I have restarted my education and done a midlife (50 yr old) career change. The thought of what it would take was too daunting, but I listened to this episode and David Goggins really inspired me. Since then I’ve gone to EMT school done six college classes science classes all with A’s and I am applying to PA school. The ideas from David Goggins, that basically the hard way is the only way and the only worthwhile way that there are no hacks. There are no shortcuts. Give me the strength to just commit and charge on through and be an inspiration to myself and to my children.",2개월 전,0,

@IntegrativeHealthGuy,"I love the work Goggins doing, but I’d be curious to see the research on long term resentment building (say if the body keeps a score) when consistently pushing the body to do things it doesn’t. My mother who happens to be a biochemist quoted how cells begin to create a push back and even likely become malignant in nature when the body has been pushed into doing things it forever doesn’t want to do. While it feels as a great build up of warrior like will power, I can’t imagine if we learn Goggins developed a brain tumour and we may never look at the correlation between being the way he is and of the way the cells became when every action was consistently done against the body’s wishes. The body too has a rhythm. Please if someone could give an insight into this.  Make no mistake— I wana go HARD on myself, but ever since my Mum mentioned it, it took me by surprise. Repeated stress on the body (maybe even the positive kind after the eu-stress phase has been crossed) has shown signs of autoimmune conditions too.  Genuinely worried. Need your advice.

His story isn’t about how everybody needs to train like a maniac, to push themselves to their absolute limits everyday and sacrifice everything for a purpose. His story is about how a man with everything going against him was able to achieve great things in spite of his circumstances. He’s not trying to tell people to be exactly like him, he’s trying to tell people that if he can do it, then so can you.",3개월 전(수정됨),3,

I consider myself fairly introspective already, but I know I haven’t gone deep enough. There are doors I haven’t found yet, let alone opened.  I like the cupboard door analogy, but what’s been coming to mind for me is more like a living treasure map - always shifting. The map is full of paths. Some I’ve walked before. Some are completely new. Some are brutal. And yet the hardest ones seem to lead to the greatest rewards. Along the way, there are demons to face and keys to collect. Keys to open other doors that take you even deeper and grant you access to new paths. As you progress through, more paths become visible / clear.  So my question is: How do you keep finding doors?

@pjfromnyc,"How did David Goggins used his tactical approach of WRITING everything down to pass the ASVAB exams to join the US NAVY and lose 100 POUNDS in 3 months & a half months 💛🏃🏽‍♂️🪖📈✍️📖  David Goggins used his “write everything down” tactic as a radical system of accountability and self-discipline—almost like creating his own boot camp. Here's exactly how he used writing to pass the ASVAB exams and lose over 100 pounds in 3.5 months to qualify for the Navy SEALs:   ---  1. He Got Ruthlessly Honest with Himself  Goggins looked in the mirror, didn’t lie, and wrote down all his weaknesses—mental, physical, emotional. He called it the Accountability Mirror.  He put sticky notes on his mirror with blunt truths: “You’re fat.” “You’re lazy.” “You’re not smart.”  Then, he added what he would do about it: “Study 4 hours a night.” “Run 2 miles after work.”   > “These weren’t affirmations. They were wake-up calls.”     ---  2. He Built a Hardcore Daily Schedule  Goggins wrote out his entire day hour-by-hour, including:  Study sessions for the ASVAB: He studied like he was prepping for the MCAT, often 4–5 hours a night after work.  Workouts: He started with short runs and built up. He eventually worked out three times a day—running, biking, swimming.  Diet tracking: He logged everything he ate, cutting out junk and reducing calories drastically.   He left no unplanned time, because downtime meant falling off track.   ---  3. He Created a War Log (Mental Accountability Journal)  Goggins didn’t just log tasks—he wrote down pain, failure, excuses, and victories to review them.  If he skipped a workout or ate badly, he wrote it down without excuses.  He also logged victories, like running an extra mile or passing a practice test.  He’d ask himself:  “Did I do everything I could today?”  “Where did I quit mentally?”  “What needs to be better tomorrow?”    This made him confront his habits, mindset, and laziness every single day.   ---  4. He Measured Progress Obsessively  He weighed himself daily, recorded test scores, and tracked miles ran. This gave him visible proof of growth—and no hiding from stagnation.   ---  5. He Used Pain as Fuel  Whenever he felt unmotivated, he would read back his failures—everything he wrote down in his worst moments—and use that shame as fuel to keep going.   ---  This system helped him:  Lose 106 pounds in 3.5 months  Pass the ASVAB (Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery)  Qualify for SEAL training  Eventually become a Navy SEAL and ultramarathon runner    ---  Would you like me to create a daily template inspired by Goggins’ method that you can use digitally or print out?",4개월 전(수정됨),1,

@pjfromnyc,"How can I use David Goggins tactic of writing everything he does down to get to weight 100lbs ✍️📚🪖  David Goggins' tactic of writing everything down is a powerful tool for accountability, self-awareness, and mental discipline. To use this strategy to get to your target weight of 100 lbs (assuming this is a healthy goal for your body type and height), here’s how you can adapt it:  1. Create a Daily Logbook  Set up a physical notebook or a digital tracker and divide it into sections:  Food Intake: Write down everything you eat and drink, with times and portion sizes. No skipping or sugarcoating.  Exercise: Log workouts, even if it’s just a walk. Include time, intensity, and how you felt.  Sleep: Track hours of sleep and quality (restless or restful).  Mindset/Reflection: Write a few lines about how you felt, what triggered cravings, or how you stayed disciplined.  Weight: Weigh yourself at consistent intervals (daily or weekly) and track progress.   2. Be Ruthlessly Honest  Goggins emphasizes brutal honesty. If you skipped a workout or overate, write it down. This helps you face patterns that sabotage progress.  3. Use “Accountability Mirrors”  Write sticky notes or reminders (like Goggins does) with tough-love affirmations or goals and place them where you’ll see them daily: mirrors, fridge, phone screen, etc.  4. Set Micro-Goals  Break the larger weight goal into small, manageable targets (e.g., lose 2 lbs every 2 weeks). Write those down and track them relentlessly.  5. Track Triggers and Excuses  Write down what made you want to quit or eat off-plan. Goggins calls out excuses in writing and fights them mentally—this helps build mental toughness.  Would you like a simple daily log template you can use or print?",4개월 전(수정됨),1,

@farouk6437,"My personal notes (NOT AI GENERATED):   ## 1. *Mindset: You vs You*  The biggest battle is between who you are and who you want to be.  To win, you need willpower and strong mental discipline.  It will suck, and it will continue to suck, but you have to want it and do it anyway.  Discomfort is part of the process, you must embrace it.  No course, video, or external resource will work if you don’t truly want it.  You are responsible for putting in the work.  Have courage and passion to overcome your inner resistance.  Create your own reality.  ## 2. *Discipline and Willpower*  Discipline means doing the thing even when you don’t want to.  “I don’t want to do it... but I do it anyway.”  Doing what’s hard repeatedly builds discipline.  Discipline is something you develop over time by being consistent.  When you’re consistent, the anterior mid-cingulate cortex (aMCC) in your brain grows.  If you stop being consistent, it shrinks back.  “I do hate doing it, but I do it. That’s discipline.”  Eventually, your brain starts to believe you love doing it.  This is how willpower is built.  ## 3. *Know Who You Are*  Many people have FOMO because they don’t know who they are.  They’ve never experienced themselves.  Much of their potential remains locked upabout 70%.  People often lie about who they are to get admiration.  They want dopamine from others’ approval, so they pretend.  This is not sustainable.  Knowing who you are means not living to please others.  Even if it feels empty at times, don’t compromise who you are.  You don’t need others to motivate you.  You build who you are every day.  “And who I say I am, I am.”  ## 4. *Your Mind and Inner Power*  Your brain depends on your internal monologue and dopamine intake.  Be mindful of both.  The right mentor or practitioner matters, don’t just trust any therapist.  Understand yourself deeply.  This is when real ideas emerge.  According to Naval, self-reflection plus silence and clarity leads to infinite ideas.  Your unconscious mind is your superpower.  Learn to shut out noise, including internal and external distractions.  ## 5. *Mission and Passion*  Know what you love and do it.  No one else needs to pick up the boat for you.  Your mission should guide your actions.  Work is part of the mission. Relationships and friendships are also part of that path.  Passion gives you the energy to follow through.  Knowing your mission and committing to it, regardless of emotional state, is key.  Perfection is not a goal; it is the natural outcome of committing to your mission.  Know your identity.  Identity is not just knowledge or guidance, it defines your path.  You are not who others say you are.  You are who you say you are.  ## 6. *Failure and Growth*  Teach yourself how to fail.  Losing is part of the learning curve:  You will lose multiple times before you start to win consistently.  Losing builds neuroplasticity, your brain adapts and grows.  Failing helps remove memory blocks created by stress or anxiety.  The brain remembers better through experience.  That’s why practice is essential.  ## 7. *Practice Strategy*  The ideal learning formula is 80% practice and 20% theory.  The more you practice, the more your brain retains.  Experience matters more than knowledge alone.  ## 8. *Health and Focus*  To support your mind, avoid the things that break focus and clarity:  - Avoid sugar. It crashes your thinking and leads to poor performance. - Eat well before intense work or exams, treat it like a gym session. - Use creatine (proven and sleep-approved). - Be consistent. - Stay passionate. - Make time to rest and recover, rest is not laziness. - Avoid social media, shallow connections, and external dopamine triggers. - Avoid noise from media.          ""The field is my god.""       ## 9. *The Learning Curve*  Learning takes time and repeated effort.  At first, progress is slow.  Memory improves as stress and anxiety go down.  There’s no shortcut to the top, just consistent practice and self-awareness.",4개월 전,8,

@Null1fy-x7r3p,"What I really like about David Goggins is that unlike most of the other influencers whatever he is saying he has proved by his own example. There is an abundant amount of information on how to make yourself motivated in work and the importance of work/life balance. But not everyone says that motivation and balance might make you better than average, but they will not make you the greatest. David on the other hand says that there is no motivation involved in what he is doing and there is no balance, he does everything necessary despite it being the most hated thing for him at that moment, and he is right. Everyone who succeeded in life spent an unhealthy amount of time on what they were doing. After some time there is no motivation involved, they just do it because they have to do it, and that's when they become greater than others.",5개월 전,0,
@colderdrums,"What I love about David is his honesty. I know that fucking feeling. He talks about how he doesn't think he's smart, but it's all about hard work and focus. I feel that too. And the thing is, sometimes I stutter, depending on my state of mind. I've had my struggles with it, but I'm a good person. I’ve got a hunger for success, and deep down, I know I'm going to make it. When I do, David, I’ll thank you a lot. Because even though you don't know me, and don't have a clue about the world I live in, I’ll still be grateful. You’ve made an impact, even if you don’t realize it.",5개월 전,3,

But for me, it seems like in this podcast he talks about suffering and pain too much and in such a way that doesn't help to improve my life, but instead makes it harder to deal with stuff. During the podcast he says multiple times that ""life sucks"". Unconsciously this information is being written to my memory and now I expect life to suck even in those situations when it doesn't suck. Also, David once said in another podcast that ""life will find your weaknesses and will beat you down"". I then start to believe it and it makes me feel weaker even when I'm good enough to deal with problems. So I kind of unconsciously program myself and complicate things this way without any need. Anyone here who has the same thoughts? Open to discussion.",5개월 전,0,

@Kirkxreign,"Achievement isn't external it's internal. You can use external results as validation, but if your still uncomfortable inside, it's not accomplished. Tbh he sounds unhealthy mentally and can point at external things to say I'm it, look what I did. Like trying to convince himself N fool many with the ""evidence."" Don't drill Sargent yourself. Love yourself first and move from there. When you can love yourself with nothing and alone, you can't ever lose. Then all your achievements will add to that. Yes it's kindness with trust in yourself. If you don't trust yourself you'll beat yourself. Enjoy the movement over the results. He's mad about something he hasn't actually ever faced before. He sounds extremely angry and hates. Especially his past self, I think he even hates what he's done cause it's only added more and more challenges instead of peace. Find your peace where you already are.

We were back in my childhood living room, where I was viciously abused (verbally, emotionally, and physically) on a daily basis by my own father and severely neglected by both of my parents. I believe it is my subconscious telling me I too am capable of transcending my tortured past and becoming a person I am proud of.

@psalmninetyone1322,"Hi Andrew. I saw one of these podcasts so I had to log in on my phone so I could subscribe and like. I really enjoy your podcasts. I must say there was one in particular with David Goggins that really spoke to me. David was talking about how he learns that he'll have to look at it again and again. And that other people might look at it one time and know it. Please let David know this for me. I have never in my life heard anyone that can describe exactly how I learned that is how I learn. In junior college in geology class I would go to the geology lab every minute that there was of the day that it was open outside of time I was in other classes I was there until it closed. Going over the different rocks and studying the different material my teacher wasn't even there the other teacher was there that ran the lab and I would stay there from sunup to sundown I would leave for dinner and come back until they closed. And I would go home and study. There was someone else that lived in my neighborhood that didn't have a car and was in my class so I would give him a ride. I remember one time asking him about the upcoming Final and asked how he's studying was going and he just kind of giggled and he said that he didn't need to study. The short of it is we both got an A. One person didn't have to study just went over the material in class with everyone else and then there was me that spent every waking moment at the lab studying. I had to do that for every single test. I have the same exact learning that he does I just have to go over it again and again and again I always would describe it well the few times I've tried to explain it to people as this. "" I totally understand something when I read it and when I hear it or when I see it"". But then I completely forget it, immediately. So I must go over the material again and again and again. The result is once I know it I know it inside and out! And I'll bet have more insight to the material then the others. I never saw that as a negative. Let David know that it's not a negative. I call that a repeat learner. So we may have to repeat the material but then we know it better than anybody else. 🙏👍🤗 two scriptures from the Bible to reference. One talks about renewing your mind and the other one talks about wisdom that it comes from God to all that ask for it. 👍🙏🤗 I really enjoyed the podcast.",8개월 전,0,
@michaelbrutallyhonest6026,"I've listened to DG off and on for years, clips, some full length podcasts. Bought his book 3 years ago,  still haven't read it. Was in a dark place, serious depression, life a mess, until March 26th '23, I took a step, very small. Committed to do this every day. The journey out hasn't been easy but DG, AH, others help tremendously. Almost a year ago I listened to a 13 minute clip of this on the Anterior mid cingulate cortex, which was amazing. Doing those small things you've put off doing, committing to be consistent, only increases your capacity to do more. Over the last 10 months, I've accomplished more than my last 10 years. Depression is gone. My encouragement to anyone where I was, start, commit to a very small step, make it doable in your mind, and stick to it. I'm 67, it's never too late.",8개월 전,3,

@M.CarmenPaz,"I am amazed that David Goggins, through his trials and determination came to the exact same conclusion as St. Paul.    - *1 Corinthians 9:24-27* - ""Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize. Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get a crown that will last forever. Therefore I do not run like someone running aimlessly; I do not fight like a boxer beating the air. No, I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize."" This passage speaks directly to the discipline and hard work Goggins preaches, using the metaphor of an athlete's training for spiritual and personal discipline.  - *2 Timothy 4:7* - ""I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith."" This verse encapsulates the idea of perseverance through life's challenges, much like Goggins' narrative of overcoming his personal battles to achieve his goals.  - *Philippians 3:13-14* - ""Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus."" Here, Paul speaks of not dwelling on past failures but pushing forward, akin to Goggins' philosophy of not making excuses but moving forward.  - *1 Corinthians 15:10* - ""But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me."" This reflects the idea that while personal effort is crucial, there's also an acknowledgment of something beyond oneself (for Paul, it's grace; for Goggins, it could be interpreted as human potential or willpower) that enables extraordinary achievements.",8개월 전(수정됨),1,

I ve been running and working out for about 30 years so far fighting my genetics.. in my 20th I dive into bodybuilding.... was invited to compete at the country's level competetion but I rejected this offer cause I was a winner for myself , in sport I achieved more than I could imagine. -  a fat kid wth zero athletic talents. and I will become a scientist as well. -  in computer science. because it's my decision and my next goal> I began to learn frontend dev at the age of 37.   people I meet think I m crazy and  they don't understand how  I can live such a horrible boring difficult life  - I 'm obsessed each time I have a goal and I can sacrifice whatever it takes to achieve. cause I hate losing.   I like to win. Men don't like me, cause they see my strengh, a loot of people are jelous of me. -  cause tey think I m kinda gifted special. there is nothing special about me apart from my work ethique. over the course of my life Ihave learnt 2 foreign lang, learn to play the piano, sing, dance, now buiding websites, graduated from uni and school with honor and medal became and athlete. well I did it for my soul. and I know the same  thing about people  as David mentioned - they  are not willing to suffer and sacrifice  they want to have a work-life balance;  - but I got used to this and this is how I win. there were days in my life when I questioned the way I live cause my strenght intimidates men and keeps me single. i don't questione it anymore.

@paulgrewal4339,"David is battling his own demons. We all do. No one needs to listen to this and take on his life. From 19-27, I felt like I had ED. I was a skinny high school kid, addicted to porn, and when I finally got a gf, I couldn’t do anything. I was afraid, desensitized and broken. So I told myself I’m broken. For 8 years after, I ate super clean, worked out 7 days a week, slept well, got successful but nothing helped. I accepted that I was broken. At 28, I met this girl. I kept everything a secret from her, just using over counter medication. 1 year into our relationship, I told her everything, fully expecting her to breakup with me. Why? Because I grew up with tough love. Being a loser wasn’t acceptable. Instead of belittling me, she told me it was all good. I popped off the pills, we celebrated small victories, I FELT SAFE. 1 month later, I was back to normal. A normal human being whose psychological issue now, was fully cured. Now, not everything can be cured with love. You gotta hustle, work hard and be strong but, all energies needs to be balanced. I would never want a partner like myself. I am the type A, OCD MF, I don’t want my partner to be like that. The Chinese have a word, TAO. You have to respect thinking that’s different than yours. And if you NEED to live like David, which a lot of us do, you need to learn how to cohabitat with those who don’t.",9개월 전,1,

No engagement often means that they dont have time or simply decides to dismiss me out of some form of prejudice or ignorance, so there has to be some form of engagement. The point I am making is that getting to the truth is hard work and that you wont get likes on for it. Some people takes this formula to mean that they have the right to be aholes though, which is a side-effect of the bite sized digital format that most people consume -- wisdom simply gets transformed and taken to mean things completely different from its source.",9개월 전(수정됨),0,

@happyjack9570,"I started today by watching your ""5 Bible verses that caused me to lose my faith"" which I fully agree with. I then read the comments and apart from one or two  they all concur as any sound thinker should. I then watched the reaction videos all of which in different ways wanted to educate you in your ""ignorance"" of your interpretation. On this latest video it proved to me you're still accepting everyone has a right to a belief but quite rightly they should also respect yours but rarely do. Keep heart as i questioned my allotted protestant faith officially at age 15 when as tradition i was offered confirmation into the Church of England and unlike my peers didn't see confirmation classes as a way to get out of normal lessons.  So I could attend communion as we don't have to show a membership card but chose and continued not to chose to commune.  My first doubt was from Genesis when Adam and Eve were unfairly kicked out of the garden for doing something the god knew they would in advance.Rapidly on was the statement that as the incestuous family developed and Cain murdered Abel how firstly could there have been a community where he could chose a wife and the other statement that there were giants. Please don't challenge any detail as I'm 74 and its a while since i read a book that is written by men (the women's one having been tossed out into the Apocrypha) that i have seen no evidence of being anything other than a history/mystery book.

@Muharrem069,"David, your words about pushing the limits of human willpower and breaking free from comfort zones resonate deeply with me – but I want to add a perspective shaped by my own journey and insights. It’s not just about enduring life’s hardships through discipline, but about discovering the depth we can uncover when our actions are aligned with a higher purpose.  Andrew, your research on willpower and the anterior cingulate cortex has given me profound insights into how consistent, intentional efforts can reshape our neural pathways. I’ve come to understand that willpower is not just a finite resource but something that can be cultivated through deliberate practice. This scientific understanding, combined with David’s philosophy of “just do it,” has helped me develop what I call the “System of Value-Oriented Continuity.”  This system emphasizes the connection between action and a why. When we align our efforts with a higher goal – for me, that goal is attaining Allah’s pleasure through a clear spiritual mission, serving others, and personal self-development – we transcend fleeting rewards. Central to this system is the purification of intention: acting not for fame, acceptance, or self-validation, but for the higher purpose of earning Allah’s pleasure. Discipline, in this context, becomes not just bearable but meaningful. Pain and happiness are no longer goals but byproducts of a life driven by higher principles and fueled by willpower.  Andrew, your findings on building willpower align with my belief that life isn’t about staying in a constant “fight mode.” Instead, it’s about creating a system of continuous, value-driven action that balances effort with meaningful recovery. Discipline isn’t an end in itself but a tool to embody our values. Mistakes, rather than setbacks, are opportunities for realignment. This system replaces fleeting motivation with consistency and chaos with intentional reflection.  I’ve also learned that recovery is as essential as effort. I’ve created anchors for myself by integrating moments of stillness and reflection into my day – most notably through the five daily prayers (Salah), which serve as spiritual rituals and moments of mindfulness. Additionally, I wake up in the middle of the night for 10 minutes to perform Tahajjud (night prayer), starting with cold Wudhu (ablution). This action, though initially challenging, has become a cornerstone of my system. Choosing to do what is difficult strengthens my mind and willpower, aligning me with pure intentions and deepening my spiritual connection.  Most importantly, this system is driven by dedication to a higher purpose. For me, that purpose is aligning my actions with sincerity and the desire to attain Allah’s pleasure. This includes fulfilling my responsibilities to myself, my family, my children, and society at large by contributing something meaningful. It is the realization that our days are limited and every moment is an opportunity to move closer to a greater goal. This awareness gives my actions spiritual depth and motivates me to act with intention and focus.  David, what I admire most about your approach is its radical simplicity – the uncompromising “just do it.” But I would add: this “doing” finds its greatest strength when it is grounded in inner sincerity and guided by values that truly transform us. It’s not just pain that shapes us – it’s the conscious decision to infuse that pain with meaning and purpose, bringing forth the inner diamond we all carry within ourselves.  Your discussion has reminded me that we are meant to transcend our limits. Not because we work harder than others, but because we can find depth in our actions that elevates us beyond ourselves. Thank you for sharing this message with the world. And thank you for reminding us that our greatest enemy isn’t the circumstances we face but the inner resistance we must overcome.  – Muharrem from Frankfurt/Germany",10개월 전,1,

@sjaypits1196,"There was no carrot, no absence of reward, no cravings or troughs, only highs when talking about dopamine. It seemed like programming oneself to want nothing yet do something. It's like giving and expecting nothing, with no definition of external, just internal. It's like competing only with oneself's limitations in terms of its current state not for the sake of achieving something since reward should not be defined and also not because you want to prove something. What remains is hope, that no matter what the consequence of the action is as long as curiosity, in the form of Goggins's action, could be answered. Goggin is like a person that you cannot satisfy because he is always satisfied. That is a satisfaction that people nowadays often misinterpret due to our orientation to external wants. Now, Goggins spoke to the public and misinterpreted. I was confused as well in the first place because I was fed up with the fact that after craving, comes the reward and is oftentimes external. Somehow society put it that way and in Goggin's current state,  when I set aside the rewards that society places on him, he is still Goggins.   So for me, it's like curiosity to oneself. Knowing oneself and discovering the unknown. Same as with other great contributors in a lot of fields. Only the division of labor classifies it, but the algorithm stays the same.

So many red flags within their vitriol... I truly hope most people these days realize the danger of these covert narcissists and just how toxic they truly are! They spend their lives being self righteous and thinking they do no wrong... Their so misunderstood, they do everything on their own, there lives have been so tough, and no one will ever be able to compare to what they have been through.... I'm not discrediting what good info and advice they do give, but I see right through them... Both are truly weak and will never truly love anything, even themselves... Hence their failed relationships and lack of supporting family or close friends... But I bet they have plenty of scorned haters in their lives paths... But narcissistic individuals are good at cutting people out of their lives, especially when they are done with them, or no longer can get any more ""supply"" from them...  The ""cussing"" comes from ignorance and not being able to express yourself more intellectually or a need to feel superior and refusal to try and express themselves in a less vile and offensive manor... You curse because you lack self control and don't care what anyone else feels about it... You refuse to change, and balk at anyone whom expects better of you...

Cursing is also a habit that is contagious so I need to forcefully remind myself not to bring this part of my communication to the forefront for the next few days after listening. Edit to add: Wow, hearing David talk about how he studies makes me wonder if I also had his learning style. I did poorly in h.s. but, when I went for a basic ambulance class I ""DUG"" in because I had such drive to do it, (then likewise for my subsequent degrees.) Learning is hard and takes much effort but, when given that effort and things are really in there and you know it... its truly amazing because no one can take it away from you. I feel the same way about fitness milestones. When YOU know what you are made of, and what you can do both physically and mentally then you have a special kind of freedom.

@tarakersey6115,"I just watched this and I could relate to this and I'm 51 years old . I have what I like to call an "" Unquiet Mind""  and I had to study like that . And I had to make outlines of everything. I couldn't learn like every one else. I didn't know I had ADHD. I Had been to the doctor and I wasn't diagnosed with that bc I wasn't running around the room. I could physically keep still. But my mind is never still.  Always on 100. I can't keep up with my thoughts. It was hard to get through Nursing School. But after me becoming a mother and a wife. It got a lot worse. I I  went through neuro psych testing and went through many tests. I have known all my life. From a little girl, my mind was not like everyone else.  I never can wind it down.  But anyway.  I can relate to him. As far as the learning. But he really needs to watch what he says about calling people "" Losers"" and  have compassion for people. I would recommend going to a Dr and getting evaluated and getting medication.  Bc it helps.   There are pills. It sounds like he is having a "" Flight of Ideas"". Trust me I know all about it. And at some point he needs to realize he was born like this at no fault of his own. And see someone and get medication . It will not cure it no  But the right combo can give him some relief. I know exactly what it's like to have an overactive brain.  No physical activity will make his brain go slower. In fact it will usually spend up.  I know what this is. I have sought help since I was 14 yrs old. I'm 51 years old. My issues get worse but it's tolerable. I see one Dr. Once every 3 months. Then another Dr  Every two weeks. It's obvious to me he has some things going on. He needs to work on his emotional pain that is  being expressed as Anger. He is also Projecting. People are actually taking advice from him?

@kineshiaharris428,And you helped me. I’m a mother of 6 divorced and 41. And I know what you meant about what you went through. Since my divorce 2 years ago everybody think I’m crazy but I’m not. I’m just learning myself. I had my first child at 16 and since then I have been focused on my family and work. Never taking time for me. But I just lost me somewhere but the only way to find me is to go through all of the stuff I ran away from. And I don’t know you but I love you for that. It just helps to know that I’m not the only one to go through this in my life. Thank you. ❤,11개월 전,0,

@mandyluzmarquez1234,"1:12:15   it might benefit to differentiate exactly who/what David speaks to when describing *it*” a peace of sh***”.  And it’s exactly that which he IS speaking to that people he speaks TO are probably not aware of even existing within them…That drive that lives so deeply and  only we can excess through free will… while THEY are hearing these words and wrongfully 1:12:15 believing he is describing merely their circumstance as making them a piece of sh***.  So while he is aware that he speaks to their will as the reason for consequences they face… THEY see the consequences as the reason themselves for   1. feeling this way ( depressed, un driven).   2. The cause for being called a piece of sh***  So it might be incredibly important to point out and differentiate what is merely the consequences of lack of “guts” to that which David is trying to describe which is capable of overriding these obstacles and needs to be the focus.",11개월 전,0,

@MrEStreaming,"Goggins gotta lotta great accomplishments under the belt and some wisdoms to share and as that body gets broke bad, I can only hope that he’ll find a new voice. One that moves him from the profane to the profound! From profane, to PROFOUND! He got the PRO part down! He got the Fane part down. Time to get FOUND… New sound… watch y’all… you’ll see… Goggins is gonna get past the profanity. And once he does, I’ll be eager to listen to what that will give him. How he has transformed himself from animal to Man-imal to Man to Master. How he has moved past that slave mentality of gettin beat down again and again and again from the outside. And then again again again from the inside. Goggins gotta get PLEASANT on the inside. Goggins gotta get PAST the profane. Goggins gotta get PROFOUND!   THAT will be the Goggins’ greatest accomplishment.  Old men get this, young men will… one day… one way or another… gotta be Pleasant. Gotta be Civil. Gotta get the head straight youngsters and man-child’s… or you ain’t gonna get any real access to polite society no matter how much money or fame you acquire. Followin the course of Iron Mike Tyson, Goggins is gonna get there. Tyson might have a few pointers to offer him… just sayin… TIME beats the FUCK out of us ALL! That meat-suit IS gonna break down, and ain’t a muthafuka on the planet that ain’t gonna die. You came into this world naked bloody and screamin and you’ll go out the same. You come from the soil, live upon it, feed from it, and will return to it. So, between the screams… get some pleasant in yur heads. Get some profound in yur heads. Fight like Tyson, yes! Fight like Goggins, yes! But don’t become a vulgar idiot in public. Keep that shit in the gym. Keep that shit in the lockers. Keep that shit in the Service.   Now, go get yur Goggins on young one’s!

I limited myself and my beliefs. I was hanging drywall, hating my job. Didn't think i could be anything more.

@The.Contractor.416,"If you have ADHD or ADD you got 30 minutes in by force lol... and you're debating to leave like me because you got the jist of the direction of this interview...   On the contrary, i don't think David is crazy and i resonate with his views on social media... it's all just noise on social media... or you can capitalize on it. Social media is a waste of time for absolutely the majority of people because it's all just blogs of materialistic lifestyles and very superficial. So it will only feed into negativity to be on there unless you have discipline and are calculated. Can you exploit social media for a gain? Or is it just useless likes and clicks in the midst of the time wasters on there. It's all as the famous line that was coined during the Roman Empire: Bread & Circuises. Useless food for a weak people to stay distracted and out of focus and purpose. I assume many of you learnt that during the planned-demic! At least i hope you did.   For myself, i came to the conclusion that discipline is paramount to anything in life... Whether it's prayer, physical activity, self education, or a balanced diet. To me, those which i listed above are a good foundation to start and if you have a hard time attaining those, then read a book i found 10-12 years ago called: The Slight Edge. It is the best book i read, which sparked my mind to begin building disciplines. And like David says, as soon as you turn it off, you get right back to square one. So you can not stop. You have to keep going. Even though ""it sucks."" We all know in our hearts that we have to keep going, and when you have that voice telling you in your head to stop, give up, lazy out, you fight it and you get a few steps further and the discipline engrains in your body a little bit more and a little bit more. Just as when you do those extra reps at the gym when you're tiring out.   I'll have to watch this in stages lol... i got to 45 minutes and I'm telling myself, i gotta do my prayers and head out to the gym! Lol...   I think many people will watch this video and resonate with David's experiences, though.   Thanks for the interview.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

Also, I feel the frustration when you are trying to learn something and your spouse/partner just ""gets it"". Story of my life with my wife and I.  She just absorbs information.   Also....this just confirms what I already knew about myself, that no matter what we have accomplished, no matter what things we have done to make us look great.....inside, we are all still that child who was picked on, scared, told they wouldn't amount to anything.

I then broke my ankle in 3 places. I gained my weight back, not being able to move and do what I to do.. I totally respect the willpower of both of you.

It's a lot like being an addict & in order to stay sober ,we have to be selfish and self-centered.  I appreciate you sharing your experiences and strength to keep on being successful.

Watching this podcast for the first time to help me STAY HARD! Good luck to anybody going through it. We will be alright. Just keep truckin 🤘🏻 Update: Today marks 31 days sober. I still have things I need to handle but sobriety was top of the list. Next up is securing a job. Let’s do this! Update 2: Today is October 1st, making it two months of sobriety for me. Still haven’t locked down a better job but I will triumph! Thank you all for the kind words 🙏🏻 Update 3: October 3rd, still sober and got a job interview on the 8th. LFG!! Update 4: I am sorry people, this is not the update you want. I made it sober from August 1st to October 13th. Said fuck it on the 14th and decided to drink. Was able to keep it “under control” for about a month and a half until last Friday (November 22nd) I somehow wound up in self destruct mode and have been excessively drinking ever since. Life is back in a wreck and I am struggling. I didn’t get that job btw. For anyone who cares, next update will be when I am on top again. God bless you all 🙏🏻 2025 Update: Happy New Year everyone!

Everything this man says can get me through anything. Common sense. Happiness used to feel like a threat to me. It was always something I could lose, so I fought ever feeling it, denied my own happiness, and lived in regret and fear, because every happy moment of my childhood seemed somehow stolen. I never lived a fearless childhood. Every day was rooted in fear and uncertainty, and ANY happy moments were eclipsed by my home situation. This is what some of us are born into. The best decision I ever made was to leave home at 14 and tell everyone to go fuck themselves. Thank you David. I wish I'd had you as my coach when I was a kid. But I do now. 🙂",1년 전,0,

@vandalar,"That's interesting that you get better basically by doing things that you kind maybe wanted to do but just can't seem to get into it, can't start or get going. IMO it's because you don't have that part of the brain developed, the neurons that are associated with that activity or that mentality are not connected. How to create connections- just like with learning- you start doing and repeating and with each time you do something new those connections between neurons get stronger and it becomes ""easier"" in a way to do it again because now, instead of having a blank space in that spot in the brain that deals with overcoming something, running, learning or whatever, now it has a connection and established pathway you can use and understand. It happened to me when i was a kid. I wanted to start running, but the day i planned on running it just didn't happen :D Because there is almost no connection in your brain with activities you haven't done before and no connections that deal with overcoming that same ""blank state"" where you can't seem to overcome something. But once you ""just do it"" a few times and start developing those habits/connections in the brain you become better at doing it.",1년 전,0,

There was trauma at the root of my rebellion and it produced rotten fruit, like my rebellion. Trauma was feeding bad girl behavior. When I knew that I was a child of God, and that there was not only research and information available to find out where I lost the key that trauma locked me up with, but there was another map in the Bible.

You raised the point early in  the discussion querying about the identity of the person who coined the concept what a child needs to survive a bad childhood is a single honest adult  witness who confirms the accuracy of the child’s vision of parental betrayal.

Its good to follow the path of least resistance to be happy, and to strive to do what is disciplined and beneficial even if its not easy in the moment, but Goggins is on the far end of that and it's not balanced.

@almaarnold7332,"Absolutely insightful from both of you. You both bring a positive message, you both bring what we need to hear.      Thing is with life is some can and do get themselves in sync but a significant number cannot master it. It is easier said than done and its as easy said as done, both statements are true.     Life is not easy and I mean just getting up each day and going through the the day. So many hurdles, big and small. Drive is needed always,   for without it we cannot even move. Just to take a shower or brush your teeth requires that all important drive/will.      I am not knocking what you both on what you say but some of us are stronger than others and some  get that light bulb moment/moments and are able to run with it, sadly there are others who push but keep falling down. They cannot seem to override that side of them for long enough to break that addiction/compulsion.  Even when/if you do manage to overide that weakness of will power and your sailing along nicely, holding steady, one little thing/big thing can kick you right back into that thing you fought so hard to get a grip of and the fight begins again.     Once your neuropathways have used something to help you cope, it is something your brain can push you into again and again.      I have been in and out of my addiction for years. I have mastered it over and over and sustained for years in between but  i know I have a weakness for it and therefore I have to show some sympathy/empathy for people who cannot seem to get a grip. One thing I do expect is some will power exersion.

@BIGGELATO,"The thing with Goggins is that he found an addiction in his sports and uses it to escape. Therefore, he is running from his demon. And demons as in emotions. Coping with escapism. His trauma has him by the throat, and his only way to escape it is to fully distract himself in the moment by doing massive actions towards something physical. Which he chose to punish, rather than worship.   He found all the way possible to punish himself physically, and using his skeletons as loophole guilt to fuel his rage while doing his activities. So in essence, this is the exact same as a drug addict, who instead chose to do physical activities to escape his ""demons"", rather than drugs. And demons are a combination of memories, experiences, emotions, feelings, moments, and that little servant in his head keeps reminding him of something he doesn't want to hear, therefore he runs from it.  That voice only keeps replaying scenarios simply because he is asking for it to do so. Thing is, the day he realizes this and chooses to battle those said demons, only then things will change for him. But in consequence, he will have an ego death, and settle. Which is something he isn't ready for. Because finding the root is the battle. He's done this plenty of times, but I don't believe he has fully done it for specific skeletons in his closet.   Nevertheless, this explains his anger, rage, cussing, etc. it is unresolved trauma or anxiety. Whether it's his past or future. Meaning, it's something he's done or lived through, or it's something he wants to achieve, and hasn't found a solution yet, causing anxiety from spending time overthinking, leading to doubt, fears etc., hence; a form of demons. Maybe not for him, but this is for anyone else reading, too.",1년 전,3,

@gives_bad_advice,"Talk about the anterior midcingulate cortex was most interesting and valuable to me.  this is something one can develop through effort over time, like a bicep.  This is a source of hope--one can deliberately fix this shit over time with nothing more than a persistent conscious effort in his everyday life.  And this approach flips everything upside down--feeling bad becomes good!  Situations that used to be bad become opportunities to grow the aMCC.  And there's nothing to wait for.  It can start right now.  Why shouldn't i put the phone down right now and beef up that aMCC?  Okay, here goes...",1년 전,0,

@recyclops1776,"David Goggins, a man renowned for his relentless drive and indomitable will, has built a life on the pursuit of physical and mental mastery. His rigid discipline and unyielding determination have brought him great success, elevating him to the realm of the extraordinary.  Yet, within the recesses of his mind, a dark specter lingers – the fear that one day, he may grow weary of the constant struggle and succumb to the seductive allure of surrender. This is not merely a concern for physical decline or loss of prowess. No, it cuts far deeper. It is the dread that the very essence of his being, the relentless drive that has propelled him to greatness, might falter and fade.  He imagines a grim future where his once-unshakable resolve crumbles, replaced by apathy and weakness. A future where the challenges he once conquered with ease become insurmountable, and the pain he once embraced as a testament to his fortitude becomes a crippling burden.  This vision haunts him, not because he doubts his strength, but because he knows all too well the fragility of human will. The knowledge that even the mightiest of warriors can be brought low by their own inner demons fuels his relentless pursuit of self-mastery, as he seeks to ensure that this nightmarish fate never comes to pass.",1년 전,1,

@itsrahulvk,"Few things I noted down in my own words. Just copy-pasting them here if anybody needed few notes (some things might be wrong):  - Anterior mid-cingulate cortex(every person has two of these on each side of the head) is a structure in brain that when people do something they don’t want to do (it’s not about adding more work, it’s about adding work that you don’t want to do) , it get’s bigger.     - According to study, Anterior mid-cingulate cortex is smaller in obese people, and gets bigger when they diet.     - It’s larger in athletes.     - It’s especially larger in people who see themselves as challenged and overcome some challenge.     - In people that live longer lives, it keeps its size.     - In many context scientists are starting to see it as not only the will power but as the seat of the will to live.     - e.g. if a person hates chilled baths and does it anyway, the anterior mid-cingulate cortex grows but if the next day you enjoy it or don’t do it out of fear or anything, it shrinks.         - anything you like to do isn’t gonna enhance your anterior mid-cingulate cortex.     - not surprising to learn that it’s strongly activated when we move our body when we don’t want to. - David Goggins says everyday he too hates doing whatever he does, because those work are obviously hard and not just for normal people , for him too in the exact same person, he just does it repeatedly , just like Micheal Phelps said, that he hated practicing everyday, but still did it every day. He knew exactly his goal. The only difference is those who get it done, at the end consecutively doing it over time, win and everyone can. - I also came to know that David Goggins also doesn’t consume mostly any content. - David Goggins says, there’s one thing he did wrong in his life : he used to please people for so many years and did it at the expense of himself. He says about himself in third person sturdily that he would never compromise David Goggins. (and now I think I too should see myself like that and protect myself that way) - To focus on his art/work, David Goggins says he cuts himself off from distractions, he’ll do only 2 podcasts a year, he’ll have his phone away, he says to be an artist, you don’t want distractions( which i also thought), googling things to fix them won’t help very much . - David says first you have to teach yourself to fail , a lot of times, only then winning comes. Learn how to fail properly. You are always in for hell and your ass being handed to you when you start but that is mandatory to happen, but also only after that you are going to win. - He says - If you had the courage and the heart and the dedication and the mindset , everybody can go fuck themselves, I know , what I know, I’ve listened to myself enough to know , I know what I know. None of you can hear what I’m hearing. And that’s what people don’t do enough of, they don’t listen to their journey. They listen to everybody else’s shit.     - In short : Do what your heart says , having had enough learning about right and wrong , don’t wait and hear other’s opinions. - Andrew says, a psychiatrist , Paul Conti whom he interviewed said “We think that the forebrain, the part of our brain that creates strategy , etc. is the supercomputer. but no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. The supercomputer of the brain is the unconscious mind. It’s the part of the mind that’s controlling almost everything. And most people don’t do the work to understand how the unconscious mind is controlling them, which is a scary thing but filled with potential. - One more thing David said but I’m summarizing in short : You’ve go to reinvent yourself everyday.",1년 전,3,

@meliemel2113,"This is from an Amazon reviewer who cured himself from schizophrenia and the steps he took to make it happen:  Paul Brown 5.0 out of 5 stars A resolve that reflects my own experience. Reviewed in Canada on February 13, 2022 Verified Purchase Amazing story. David Goggins shares his story of a personal transformation that is very powerful ( providing you can get beyond the many cursings he has to offer.) This man stumbled upon the very powerful laws of success, and used it to change his life and destiny within this world. I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia with delusions of grandeur, and for 7 years I was in and out hospitals: medicated, electroshocked and had no lasting improvement. The doctor later deemed me affected with ""treatment resistant schizophrenia,"" and recommended my mom transfer me to a long-term care facility (she became my legal guardian as I was deemed a danger to myself.)  This took a turn for the worse and I almost offed myself after realizing the ""reality"" I believed and lived in for 7 years was a lie. The shock broke me, and my whole being called for death shortly after. But there in the process of committing my final act within this world, lighting struck and I came to myself. I saw this as the act of a coward, because I feared living in this world, hated and laughed at by everyone and everything. ""Am I going to let them bully me to end myself? Not a chance. If they want me to go then let them do it with their own two hands. I will no longer run nor hide away in isolation."" From that moment on I chose to take back my life from schizophrenia. I faced down every giant it sent to crush me with an unshakable resolve: the giant of extreme anxiety, the giants of fear, paranoia, delusion, the giant of intrusive and blasphemous thoughts, the giants of hallucinations (auditoy and visual,) the giants of insecurity, hate, resentment, persecutory delusions (the world was in me and every where I went people would reaď my mind commenting on my thoughts mostly laughing at the torment i was experiencing,) giant of distrust, the giant of loneliness (there was not a person in the world who i felt I could talk with and pain of that loneliness was unbearable.) I hid away in my room because it was ""safe,"" but in this form of safety there was no freedom, there couldn't be any. But where the ""pain"" was, in the middle of that fire, the last place I wanted to be, was exactly where I needed to be: I had to willingly choose to make myself uncomfortable. Everyday from that moment of revelation, I left my room and talked with my mother and sisters, whom I thought were witches trying to kill me through witchcraft. I no longer waited for them to come into my room and greet me, instead when they got home, I went out and greeted them. I didn't do it because I felt like it, I did it because I didn't feel like it. I hated them for what I thought they did to me, and because I hated them I chose to embrace them. One inch at a time, one day at a time, I was able to move forward until today, I'm 100% free from all schizophrenia symptoms. I've been off meds for nearly 15 years now. I became an electrician and even passed my red seal and have been working full time in the trade. I just had my one year anniversary that I celebrated with a nurse that I married.  A co-worker loan me ""Can't hurt me"" because my story of recovering from schizophrenia, more specifically, how I did it reminded him of Goggins own mentality to get beyond his own insecurities, etc. I’ve never even heard the name Goggins until that point. But reading his story resonated with me because I too lived with that defeated self. I too held that ""woe is me"" victim mentality. I'd ask myself, ""why me? What did I do to deserve this?"" And I still suffered nonetheless. But when I shifted the question to, ""WHY NOT ME?!"" Again, the heavens opened up and a light came shining down touching my soul deep within (metaphorically speaking of course:) THAT'S THE QUESTION! It hit me so hard. For so long I couldn't see it. Why not me? Why do I deserve to be excluded from suffering? Babies are born into the world with all sorts of sickness and diseases and suffering, and here I'm crying, why me? I felt so ashamed I could barely lift my head. Nevertheless, this energized me to take on the entire world, and I did, and I won. I managed to accomplish what the doctors said to be impossible for someone who had schizophrenia as entrenched as i did: I overcame schizophrenia.  Reading this book made me realize why my co-worker asked me about Goggins. Many times it was as if I was hearing myself talk, word for word. It was incredible. It's a great book for the person who's tired to living defeated, whose back is against the wall and you've no way out. Within your darkest hour also lays your moment of opportunity to turn the tides of your struggle. Goggins tells us his story. I just shared a part of mine, and you've got your own to write with your life as you face down each obstacle trying to drag you under, and put them under your feet. It's our story, we determine the how it's told.",1년 전,0,

Different men, different circumstances of course, but here I am at 42 and I don't feel successful because I'm not where I wanted to be. (Yet). And this time, 3.5 years single, I've tried dating. This last one, I realized I was losing my strength with him, and felt like I would again not get to where I need to go in this life, with him, or anyone. I don't know if this is long term. And the sacrifice sucks- raising my 3 kids on a Texas teacher salary is ludicrous. I know our lives would be better if I could sacrifice my (feels like selfish needs) now, and keep grinding.

That’s what he meant when he said sometimes you get sucked right back into the cupboard.   David found a way out of those cupboards (maybe that’s part of why he created Goggins).

Then eventually when I got comfortable I joined the gym and every single fucking day I went every day 3 hours either before work or after but I went and it sucks I was tired and people talk shit and people make fun of me but you have to be fucking stronger than your fucking mind no you have to be stronger than the words that you're trying to convince yourself that you are.. a year later I weighed 147 lb everybody thought I got gastric bypass 327 lb at 27 if I can push myself anybody can push themselves out of anything you just got to want it bad enough nobody's going to motivate you but you you can do it I promise you you can do it it's going to be fucking hard you're going to want to fucking give up you're going to want to listen to the fucking refrigerator and go get that twinky.

@snowrider9018,"Goggins is a different influencer than any other I've seen. Lots of influencers really do preach quotes, live in social media where they hide their reality of their true selves. And us, consumers of media, really try to find EXTERNAL REASONS to temporarily motivate ourselves with podcasts, supplements, merchandise, etc. or do the opposite and feel depressed because other people enjoy life more than me.  But Gogginism is very INTERNAL, him writing his book is an EXAMPLE and EPITOME of an ordinary person who is the ""bottom of the barrel."" The overall MESSAGE of all his books is: ""if I'm able to overcome the most stressful situations in life with the genetically worst cards dealt to me and still be on top, then any person ON EARTH has the capacity to do that as well.""  I also found his advice to other people be unique: he advises to OTHER PEOPLE to not to do exactly what he is doing (running, going to be a Navy SEAL, etc.), but he influences people to find THEIR OWN challenges, weaknesses, strengths and to spend time ALONE to have those conversations within our minds. We need to identify and battle our OWN wars to stay on top of ourselves. BE THE BEST VERSION OF US ALL THE TIME.  Like in the matrix, the CHOICE is to either be our true selves or hide away and gain the attention of the social norm. Callusing the mind is really something you MUST BUILD, you're never born with it.  Here's how I'm applying this lesson to my life: I will openly express that I am a young, selfish, hot-headed college kid that is very stingy with money. I have a long track record of easily having a bad attitude with other people who push my buttons. Now I realize that I put myself around those people in order to try to ""live the college life"" which ends up backfiring. My challenge is that I have to find a way to not be selfish and control my emotions properly. However, my strengths is that I'm a hard-worker and although I'm cheap I really do find enjoyment in giving gifts to people I love. This is my hand I'm dealt with in my life.  Today, I started rucking light with 20lbs going 3.5 miles to get a benchmark. Now my motivation is just to do the same thing tomorrow, but maybe 0.10 miles farther. I'm also learning my own language Tagalog and reteaching my Nursing School material in preparation for next semester even though it's summer. My challenges are different than Goggins, but by utilizing his similar mindset, I'm revealing my hand in order to build my life to it's greatest potential.  I wish you all luck on your OWN journeys.

@f.f.6323,Repetition is everything!  I failed the 8th grade & felt talentless & weak.  I was a white kid in a mostly black school.  I started studying a Thesaurus & spending hours learning my Math & Science & by high school was taking advanced classes.  I became Editor of the Newspaper & won several awards.  My teachers would bs me & tell me how talented I was.  I wasn't talented.  I simply spent all my time making myself good enough to stand out a little until I was.  I'm not so sure anyone is born with talent.  I know I wasn't.  I still struggle so this is sort of show is very encouraging.,1년 전,3,

When I left the last time I couldn't walk 50' without someone in each arm and a wheelchair behind me.  I was bedridden for 10 years.  I decided I wasn't going out that way.  I walked halfway to my neighbors house.  Long story short,I ultimately ended up waking from my home back to same nursing home. When I walked in, Noone knew who I was! They thought I was there to visit someone! The director of the PT department had me walk for him. I quote, ""If I  hadn't seen it for myself, it's never believed it!

Like being in a position: do it or die. Nothing to lose, everthing to win... Luckily, the majority have never been in such a situation but that's the very reason why they, me included, will never gain such a will power.

@TheMrshawnpaul,"Going through a rough patch and this interview was one heck of a wake up call. My excuses certainly don’t compare to what David went through.  Exceptional interview skills by Dr. Huberman; it was great to learn about some of the science behind Goggin’s unmatched willpower  and thought process. I particularly enjoyed learning how the anterior midcingulate cortex affects willpower and how it’s strengthened by doing the things that you don’t want to do. I fear that mine is quite weak as I often make decisions based on comfort and/or pleasure. It’s empowering to know the science and biology behind willpower and it’s something I certainly need to train.  I’m curious to know the specifics about David’s breaking point, when he finally decided enough was enough. For me, getting started is the hardest part, I’m usually able to stay in motion once I get in motion. It would be interesting to hear David’s story of when he first started on this new life path.",1년 전,0,

@alexkrol1114,"I’d like to touch on the relationship aspect of the video. I believe it is in relationships and serving people that will power is very strongly tested. Like what Andrew said about that part of the brain that grows will power when we do something we don’t like. Normally when we serve others, we are doing what we don’t want to do for other people. Instead of looking at relationships as hindering our path for growth in will power. This is the strongest opportunity to grow in will power. We don’t have to push off our relationships in search of growth when the most growth can happen in the relationship. This is a reason why the majority of marriages now end in divorce because it’s hard. It’s hard to serve someone and grow in relationship with someone because it calls us to sacrifice ourselves and therefore our will power grows and that part of the brain grows. I believe that’s why the old people who have been married for 60 years feel so fulfilled, because they also found what David Goggins said he found by denying himself everyday. This is exactly the key to a successful lifelong marriage.",1년 전,0,

So I'm intrigued by the anterior mid-cingulate cortex. Wondering if you can point me to any data about it and women in labor. I'm a midwife and I have been speaking of this ""will-power"" piece in regards to childbirth. There is a time in childbirth (mind you, only normal, physiological, unmedicated childbirth) where every women either thinks this or says it out loud: ""I can't do this"". This is usually at the end when in fact, the baby is not far from arriving. It's the cliff...every women needs to get to the cliff, think they can't go further, and then....they walk out in faith....and just do it. There is sooo much about this....I could go on forever, but I'm curious if you've come across any research about the anterior mid-cingular cortex and childbirth.

And that’s not a perspective or an opinion, that’s a fact  The fact is DG is talking about how to use consciousness to overcome our self limiting thoughts and that only ever happens now. Because our thoughts are in the past (memories) or their hopes for the future. Neither are real. Tomorrow never comes and you can’t get the past back. But you have this moment and you have to choose it every single time. Not once, not twice, not a couple time but constantly every day.  That’s what David is doing.

@Kenoji8,"This is the episode that teaches the truth about life itself, the truth that is kept away from our ears in a ""comfort-centric culture."" It is not about pleasure or dopamine or reward, but about the pain of overcoming obstacles that we don't want to overcome and about the work that we would rather not do in order to grow and to learn. To do what we don't want to do brings us greater reward than those things that we want to do and are rewarded. This is the YouTube video and episode that will literally change the very operation of your life if you open your mind and accept the ""suck"" and the challenges of life...and not just run away from them when they appear.   I've needed this advice since I was a little kid suffering from depression and not wanting to be here in the first place. Had I heard this as a kid and understood the message, I would have taken every challenge on knowing that each challenge would suck...but doing it anyway because it just had to be done. And in the end, I would grow faster than anyone who wasn't willing to put in the work.",1년 전(수정됨),6,

You get one life, and God only knows how many chances. So, make every punch count, and as Carl Jung would say, ""Confront your shadow."" It ain't going anywhere, so wage your war! I'll use a bible verse Goggins would appreciate, ""Accordingly, I don’t run aimlessly but straight for the finish line; I don’t shadow-box but try to make every punch count.

What a special moment for Goggins, Huberman and all viewers when Huberman essentially validated Goggin's approach to his life with scientific evidence was podcast magic!

David Goggins has lived this way and pushed through pain to the Nth degree and for so many years that it has become his nature.  It would seem that he has developed the portion of the brain that Huberman was speaking of more so than any other human ever has and to the point that it has become his nature and he ""can't not do the things he does and/or the way he lives his life.  Very humbling for the rest of us who all know that greatness is within the grasp of us all and yet we are not willing to commit, focus, and sacrifice in order to achieve the life we say we want to have.

@KateGladstone,"I have a question about the anterior mid-cingulate cortex. What happens to it (and to the person it’s in) if the thing that the person doesn’t want to do (that the person forces himself or herself to do anyway) is an actually bad thing? For instance: let’s say there is a person who WANTS to do the things that are actually good (such as WANTING to do an exercise program, or WANTING to do things that increase willpower). Therefore, the only things he or she DOESN’T want to do (the only things that will actually grow his or her anterior mid-cingulate cortex) happen to be bad things: such as being lazy or whatever: things that are wrong to do in  themselves, and/or things that will have bad effects on the person who does them. Should that person/must that person there decide to do those bad things so that his/her interior singular cortex will grow and not shrink? From what you’re saying, it sounds as if the people with the biggest anterior mid-singular cortexes would have to include people who naturally want to be virtuous and righteous, but who force themselves to be/do the opposite!

@beccahannigan1187,"Really incredible message. I will say, though, that I don't understand how Dr. Huberman can say, or believe that ""no one has ever died because of their emotions."" I think I understand how we can get that impression with minor emotions, like when you're feeling sad or anxious one day, but there are endless examples of emotional states overtaking a person, such as they act harmfully or fatally---suicide (extreme depression or grief), homicide (anger), even heart attacks (from grief, sadness, stress), amongst many, many others.  I don't mean to make this a personal dig on Dr. Huberman (who has received plenty of digs already), but that's a prototypical masculine mindset (like the erroneous distinction between ""reason"" and emotion). It seems like such a statement can only be made by someone who hasn't experienced those emotional intensities---when individuals talk about struggling with emotional states, they aren't just biting their nails about small upsets; they're big.   At the same time, I so totally appreciate what Goggins is saying---I need to hear it!",1년 전(수정됨),1,

@t.l1357,"I've had many of the issues he's born with but realized pushing myself created more health issues. I gave it all up to God and remembered that Jesus said we can do more things than him when he was performing miracles. He told the disciples that some demons couldn't be removed without Prayer and FASTING!  This lead me on a spiritual journey to either stop being a Christian and just believing something else.  After I gave it one last shot by humbling myself and ego....doing a prayer fast and asking to be cured from hypothyroidism and sent knowledge on how to fix health issues from the root cause,  earnestly, it happened!  I know now in my heart that the battle isn't mine, it's the Lord's.  Another health issue has come at me and I'm currently giving that over to God as well.   David has his way that works because what he literally says, is how his life manifests. He says his life is gonna be hard so it is. He says he's in a fight everyday and he is. He says I have to learn in this certain way and he does.  My point is God's first example of power,  is the Spoken Word of God and it was ""Let there be light.""  That's how powerful words are and you can speak miracles or curses on your life.   So let the power God gave us all make things easier for you.  Jesus already paid the price.  He already told us we can go further than him.  I'm in that side of accessing what God already promised. The Kingdom is a great place to be and I pray that everyone who comes across this post has peace in their spirit and is blessed. 🙏🏾💕",1년 전(수정됨),0,

@GabagoolMoltisanti,"To motivate a donkey to move ahead you either dangle a carrot in front of it or you hit it with a stick. Similarly, if you want to motivate humans you either show them the reward for doing something (carrot) or a punishment for not doing something (stick). David's main motivation is to avoid punishment i.e. to not become the man he used to be.   Search for 'carrot and stick' in your native language and you should find a more extensive description of this idea.",1년 전,2,

Your podcast provided a platform for David to share his insights and experiences, and I appreciate how you facilitated the conversation with such thoughtfulness and depth.

@LaSoanyah,"As I listen to Andrew Huberman and David Goggins discuss building immense inner strength, I'm inspired to push myself harder and develop greater resilience. On most days...yes...this is my mindset. However, I need to remind myself to be cautious. As a workaholic with an addictive personality, I know I can easily fall into the trap of overworking and overachieving, which has led me down a dangerous path in the past.  Remember,  pain releases dopamine as well.  I've read many comments from others who, like me, are drawn to this mindset, and I understand the appeal. But I also know that I need to be careful not to let my enthusiasm for self-improvement become an excuse for neglecting my mental health and spiraling into pain chasing.  I've been down that road before, and it's a slippery slope. So, while I embrace the idea of building inner strength, I need to do so in a way that's balanced and sustainable for me. That means listening to my body and mind, taking rest days when I need them, and prioritizing my well-being alongside my goals. I'm committed to growth and self-improvement, but I also know that I need to do it in a way that honors my whole self, not just my drive and ambition. 🙏🏾❤",1년 전,0,

Matt. 11 Verses 28 to 30 [28] Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. [29] Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. [30] For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.""  Try jesus David. He will soften your hardness and make you a more gentle person. You can still do you and complete your tasks of everyday living.   Jesus will light the way, just call him into your heart, thank him for everything you have in your life, repent for your sins, then ask him yo come into your life, tell him what you need, he slready knows though hes just waiting for you to call unto him. He will always be there for you. Jesus is the best friend you could ever have.   Blessings to all ❤",1년 전,0,

Going from being obese and letting his demons eat him alive to chasing those mother fucking demons, losing over 100 pounds in 3 months, joining the Navy Seals, going through 3 hell weeks in a year, running over 200 mile runs, and that’s just naming a few of his accomplishments. I’m just at the start of project: get my damn life together, and this man’s story is truly inspiring to anyone going through hard times, or those who grew up with a rough childhood that drags them down to this day.

Also, wanting to learn and keep learning all your life is something that many of us strive for. He doesn't want to be a surgeon. What is wrong with being a paramedic? He is learning a lot!! Knowledge that he hasn't had. He doesn't have to do what you or anybody else tells them to do. He doesn't want to be a doctor or anything else. Plus, what does GPA have to do with everything he has accomplished? I value him more for his mindset and what he has done than a stupid GPA.

I was responding to person above saying he can do anything he sets his mind to, and I responded with examples of things he'd never be able to achieve no matter how hard he tried. Also, it seems like you're offended by the mere concept of GPA; to some extent I agree it doesn't mean much, but it's a widely accepted metric for proficiency in college level coursework, which itself is a benchmark for competence needed for desirable jobs. Being a paramedic is cool and is crucial for society, and I'd respect if an average Joe takes up the job.

Left my hometown at 17, went to college & learned a lot about parenting myself: reading and re-reading to study. I took meticulous notes. Ended up on the deans list and got accepted into a BSN nursing program and gave up my seat to start a business. I pushed myself to prove to myself I could. I normalized hard. I then was blessed with a son. Now that he’s almost 5, I’m ready to push in my personal growth again, while also being a strong mother and wife. I can do better. I can be better. I want to.

@deagler-bs,"First time hearing listening to David Goggins after hearing about him so much. I like his philosophy, but I do have some follow-up questions that maybe other people can help with.  Andrew asked Goggins if his life events were necessary to spur that initial change within him. Describes it as being ""haunted"" by his past...  I understand how this can work for someone in poor health or who's a dreg to society, but what does Goggins have to say to people who have had pretty good lives, i.e., not haunted by their past?  He says that the problem with most people is that ""they don't want it,"" but it sounds like a haunted past is an essential ingredient to wanting it. Is it fair to demand that everyone else ""wants it"" as much as you do when they haven't endured the same hardship? Is it even possible for them to ""want it"" without any hardship in their lives?  As someone who's had a very fortunate life myself, I don't feel as though I need to spur any change. I am happy how I am, and I don't think life has to suck the way Goggins says. I don't feel like I'm missing anything in life, despite not pushing myself to the absolute limit like Goggins does.  So then Goggins' message, in my interpretation, really mostly applies to those who look at themselves and their lives, and they hate it.   I do also think he misrepresents how many people wake up and just immediately hate their lives. Yes, misery is relatable, and everyone has felt that at some point or another, but every day? No, I think that's just Goggins, and that's totally fine. He has all of the justification in the world to be the way he is and think the way he does. I just think his mindset, yeah, doesn't work for most people because they're people who are happy with their lives and don't feel the need to physically destroy themselves only to still not be enough.",1년 전,0,

It is the center of inner strength and will power and is activated by doing stuff that is hard for us. In Goggins own words if I stop doing hard stuff I am right back when I was 300 lbs. Short cuts, brain hacks, flowery motivation shit just eventually deactivates will power and tenacity. Goggins entire life is about doing hard stuff period and he freely admits were his power comes from.

@realdwayneanthony,"I’ve been reflecting on David Goggins’s journey, and it’s impossible not to admire his unparalleled achievements and sheer mental fortitude. Like many, I find his story deeply inspirational, especially as someone who has navigated the rough waters of childhood trauma myself. Goggins’s approach to life through ultra-endurance, mental discipline, and cognitive strategies is nothing short of extraordinary. Yet, this makes me ponder the complexities of human resilience and coping mechanisms.  My own path, much like his, initially took me down the route of pushing my physical and mental boundaries to their limits. For nearly two decades, I’ve been a personal trainer, nurturing a passion for running, lifting, and the pure joy of exercise. Inspired by how much I related to goggins, I found Ultra… There was a time when the thrill of ultra-distances and solitary challenges of self-supported 100Km+ mountain missions were my ultimate testaments to dealing with my shit.  However, an intriguing shift occurred as I delved deeper into the emotional landscape of my traumas. It wasn’t until I recently sought out assistance beyond my understanding and capabilities that I began to truly confront and mend the embedded scars of my past. This journey of emotional exploration and healing brought about a profound transformation. The relentless need to prove my endurance (and myself) through the next 100-miler, to meticulously plan my training year, gradually faded away. Now, if I run, it’s for the sheer pleasure of it—nothing more than a marathon distance, often just to revel in nature’s embrace.  This transformation has led me to a place of contentment and peace I hadn’t known before, revealing that the emotional conquest was the piece I was missing. Reading David Goggins’s books, I found his stories and challenges very relatable. And while I see him continuing his path with the same fervor as ever, I can’t help but wonder about the ‘what ifs’. What if more exploration of the emotional dimensions of his life could offer him, or anyone for that matter, a different kind of peace and fulfillment?  It’s not my place to speculate on anyone’s journey, especially someone of David Goggins’s caliber. His accomplishments speak volumes, and if his method is what works for him, that’s admirable. Yet, from my own experience, addressing the emotional scars not only broadened my perspective but also alleviated the constant push for more, allowing me to find joy in simplicity and in moments I previously overlooked.  In the end, we’re all walking our paths, facing our challenges, and hopefully finding our peace. Goggins’s story continues to inspire and always will.",1년 전,1,

So got off of it last year, then all of a sudden, my weight started dropping off like is was supposed to... lost 30 pounds so far and have 8 pound to go to get to my goal.

@Gm__MUA,"I think what would help David to finally conquer his inner “demons” is to reframe his “demons” as his authentic emotional pain he suffered growing up through his own action or the action of others.    If he can view his “demons” as his emotional pain of days gone by, he will gain compassion and love for the young and emotionally fragile man he once was and start healing the parts of his emotional mind that were hurt thus making him whole again.     He needs to look behind these self-disparaging thoughts that spring to his conscious mind and “see” and feel the emotional pain of his childhood and heal it…not challenge it or push it away or judge it but to heal it.  He needs to give his emotional pain all the love, support and compassion he couldn’t give to himself at the time.    With this new understanding  and new approach, the pain behind the disparaging thoughts will eventually  heal and fade making him whole again.  From him to him.  On a personal note, I would rather focus on giving myself all the love, faith, support and compassion when endeavouring anything new rather than fighting off demons.  It can be very tiring.    By focusing on the love, we’re leaving the demons  behind.",1년 전(수정됨),2,

He smiles when he talks about being haunted and ""the stick"", but also his significant other and Charlie.     There is one thing I think Goggin's is partially dishonest with himself about.   While he may not be strong academically, he is not dumb in the least.  People who curse typically have higher intelligence, in that they curse because they understand nuance in conversation and how to make their communication felt, instead of just heard.  Goggin's doesn't just spew cursewords, it is strategically relate emotion, including with himself. People who curse typically are also more transparent and honest.  That is not original thought, but was in a study that I read somewhere.  May have even been at Stanford, and one of Andrew Huberman's studies. I don't remember.    This podcast was awesome, as much as I have consumed David Goggins he always seemed like an emotionless, hardass, robot.

Almost no people on this Earth with the amount of willpower he has. Most people would die before doing what he has, and it's not because they're lazy.

@melan0101-x8f,"I believe that not everyone should be placed in front of a microphone and speak their mind. There are so many people that are hurting this already very damaged world and society, especially in the mess that the USA is in right now. But David Goggins is truly a godsend. The world needs more of him. I know some people will read this and think it's a stretch, but if we all had even a little of the will and discipline David has, imagine how much better things could be, for everyone. But only the selected few will hear messages like this and actually make it a living reality, so it becomes actual legimate proof for the rest. That it can be done, and if your drive is right, it WILL be done. I'm at a point where I have lost all hope in life. And I'm glad I did, because as David says, I also don't live off the hope factor anymore. As a woman, I spent years of my life pouring into people, situations, that completely drained me and left me broken, alone, and depressed. All because of hope. Because I hoped things would get better. Because I hoped this and that would happen. But life is brutal, and despite my best efforts to be good, I was dealt shit fucking cards. But I will rise from the ashes of everything reality burned for me. Videos like this really do change a person's life. I'm grateful that during a time where I find myself the most lonely and depressed I've ever been, there are people like David that remind you that despite the suck, the only way out is through it. This pain and the pain I have gone through in the past will mold me. I don't care to be successful, rich, and famous. All I want is to someday conquer my crippling depression and broken heart and say I fucking did it. I'm at the bottom of the pit right now, but someday I know I will look down at the pit, and I'll be strong enough to keep myself from falling in it. And next time, instead of expecting someone, especially someone I once loved more than life itself, to catch me... I will catch myself, take accountability, and fight through the suck. Instead of succumbing to it. I'm not waiting anymore, I'm not hoping anymore for someone to save me. I'm not waiting for my knight to come. I will be my own knight, my own warrior, because it truly is me versus me. I am beyond grateful for this video. It's come at a point where I needed it more than ever. I know this may sound dramatic to some, but this video saved my life. When all else has failed for me, I finally found someone who understands the suck but pushes on. It's what I've dreamt of doing, I just didn't know it was possible. But I'll see to it myself. I'm a depressed lazy piece of shit now, but someday I'll come back to this comment and see how far I've come. Thanks to anyone who read this through. I'll use this to hold myself accountable. Here's to embracing the suck and going through it instead of finding ways around it. We can do it. We can do anything we set our mind to. If you're in a pit, I pray you'll find your way out of it, too. It's not where you're meant to be.  Believe that. And just fucking do it. Although these messages seem more geared towards men, I hope David knows his messages work on women, too. Here's to being the best you can fucking be. Stay hard",1년 전,19,

@MadisonlovesJesus777,"Hey, I just want to say that God loves you so much 💕He loves you so much that He sent His Son, Jesus, who is One with Him from heaven to earth to save you. Jesus lived a perfect life with no sin in your place for you 🩷 He suffered and was treated like a criminal to pay the penalty of our sin, He died to pay our debt. He rose again to life on the third day! Anyone who repents (realizes they are a sinner in need of a savior, leading to turning away from sin and to Jesus) and they place their faith in Jesus, they will be reborn, they will be saved. 🩷 Romans 10:9 in the Bible says “If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.” Sadly those who haven’t placed their faith in Jesus will go to hell for their sins. God wants us to come to Jesus to be cleansed and made new, through faith in Jesus we will be given eternal life in heaven 💕 The Bible is Gods word; the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are the gospels of Jesus in the Bible, read them if you want to know more about Jesus’s words and His love. God bless you! 🫶🫶 Psalm 46:1-3 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.

I was not a SEAL. Listening to him talk about his past and present, I come to the conclusion that he needs  some form of counseling. I'm not a professional. But he needs to let go of the past and the idea that, to be better, he needs to be in this perpetual war with himself. If you no longer care about what others think of you, then sit back do yiur thing, relax and enjoy. Enjoy your wealth, your wife, and enjoy your life. I agree that we all need a little friction in our lives. But that's just doing things that make us feel good once we have completed them. Like getting out of bed earlier to get our cardio done for the day, getting our strength training done after work, weather that's at 6 or 7 pm., eating more sensible meals, reading every day. I agree with him on some that. I do it every day. But, running yourself to the ground, for whatever reason, is counter to reaching a state of mind that can help you be feel good about yourself. I also agree that we do need to stop feeling sorry for ourselves, but we also need to give ourselves credit where credit is due. Thanks for the  show Dr. Huberman.",1년 전,1,

I have never give up because i belive in my self. The way david put it is is what reality looks like but no one talks about it  Like he said a lot of folks hide it very well  Not al of us knows or born with a brilliant mind or a normal behavior  He puts it in a way that it really gets to you or maybe for a few people that deals with similar lifes.

Please think deeply about this with urgency because this is your eternal life and soul, you don’t know when you could die, meaning you could die at any moment, so please consider this with all your heart.

@jojodesmond6211,"Goggins is pure testament that you only have yourself in this world to break through tough barriers and overcome pretty much anything. Fascinating about the anterior mid sing- cortex getting bigger and smaller with doing things you dont like! Brilliant! I would love an episode on AD(H)D versus Dyslexia, because my mum professionally taught kids (in a different way) who were dyslexic, with amazing results and most schooling, esp in UK, doesnt cater for learning more creatively, which a dyslexic brain often is and under appreciated. Sir Richard Branson and Sir Anthony Hopkins both were, who said he had to read his scripts a minimum of 250 to get it into his brain and 'off-book'. We seem obsessed with the ADHD diagnosis, but arent the two massively linked? Kids get left behind and then lose those focus skills and drop-out because they are left feeling stupid. Add to the mix the use of smart phones and too much tv and screen time in young children. Could this be a cause of this 'new' pandemic of attention-deficit-brain and do we really believe sticking everyone on Ritalin is the right choice long term? (alternatively running ultra marathons) ... I see mums handing phones to 2 year olds now...where's the public health warnings?! Can you unpick this in an episode..unless I've already missed this?

@milanrdesign,"from someone who suffers with depression his whole life. Medication does help, but its a change of lifestyle that helps most. Eating healthy, working out, going out for walks daily, choosing your friends even though some may seem to help they are worth letting go.

Without another human being to understand and you don't why your treated badly but there is something about you that people want to run from and you don't know why they run and you feel so bad inside you just want someone to hug you and noone trusts you. And you carry a weight so heavy but you know your not who they think you are. Because you have spirit guilds that won't let anyone kill you. But they can test you that is alarmed. I passed my test and I am better off alone than to go out in public cause you have to watch the changes on the faces of people you love. . Because when the face is blank you know they are thinking about a way to hurt you and feel justified in doing it. Sorry I am sad today. I tried to get in touch with the man who wrote mastery because I had not spoken to my oldrst sister and when she found out that my lymph fluid is not taking the toxins out of my body she came and forced me to let her in. And she took care of me the second day i was with her she had a stroke i barely stepped out of the room but the dr took her off water and food and i wanted to ask if that was normal because they did the same to my mom. My sister went into kauss mauls breathing and I laid on her chest and cried sisdy don't leave me please sissy.

David has learned to not see the negative voices in his head as enemies, but instead a mentor. Most of us only allow one sort of internal dialogue & that dialogue usually preaches to us complacency.

@Alex-ss9ou,"40:50 Some people may hate hearing this, but for the rest of us, this is exactly what we love to hear from you, man. Even though, I am doing fairly well, I've always wanted to focus more and get out of the ordinary, I hate the idea of a mediocre life. But for many years now I've been feeling like everything is foggy in my mind, I just sit and think way too much, I want to do more work and I refuse to go out, to just hang out, but I end up just sitting and thinking. Letting myself disconnect might just be the largest mistake I'm doing, because focusing for me has been ridiculously hard in the last few years. All my friends, even a few that are more successful than me, always tell me to go out and have more fun and I do, but I always end up regretting, struggling to get back in the game. The issue could be more complicated at the core, but regardless, I don't think there is any other solution than ""staying hard"" at all times. There can't be any magic solution, other than complete disconnection and ridiculously hard work.",1년 전,0,

@MrPinkfloydian,"At a certain point I was like: ""The Paul Conti series..."" (...) ""Oh right, Paul Conti series..."" and then Andrew even brought that up. I mean, Goggins really grabbed me with his initial testimony of his struggles and how he goes around it, over and over for days and weeks. That's exactly what I feel with my struggles... but I'm one of those f-lazy people that doesn't go the extra mile, that doesn't work on my will power. My ADHD...? 🤔 Well... I just gave-up exercising that ""muscle"" (of will power). And that's what he says: it's a struggle, it's hard... and fortunately he didn't sugar-coated it. But... he is so negative! OMG! So negative that he is too toxic for me. Sorry. Some (many) may grab inspiration from that and change their lives for the better. Even I enjoyed a lot (mostly the 1st half) of this f-slap in my f-face. Thank you, David Goggins! But... there's the other side. And what Paul Conti shared with us was The Positive process to figure it out, opening the covets, facing the demons, whatever comes out, and do the work, ""action, action, action"" or... ""agency, agency, agency (... right?... right...?)"". Again, I prefer the latter, the balanced one. I think it's more than enough to realize that life is hard, that most of the f-'rs that one may encounter will mess with your path... instead of adding to that, telling yourself, addressing to yourself, telling yourself that pseudo-motivational speech of ""You piece of sh*t! Do it..."" No way! There's the world sending your emotional state through the roof... and then you should also be creating another war against yourself? No no, thank you very much.

I was so happy to know that I can read and comprehend large books. I read so many Stephen Kings books. I learned my mind will digest the words if I am interested in the subject. When I am a millionaire I will pay someone to read and comprehend for me. I do know I am a visual learner so even if someone else read it and then explained it to me. Yes that part of ADHD is very difficult. I had a psychiatrist tell me I was smarter than the smart kids because I learn differently and I had to learn my own way. I said I thought I was just slow like my mom told me. He said no I take longer because I have to change the information so I can understand it. I think schools need to change their teaching styles. I love listening to you David. I listen I don’t know if I can incorporate it in my life. I am much more laid back. I would say be more gentle with your body.

So Andrew setting his ""story"" of starting at the hour mark (or 30 minutes)... he is just paving his way, setting the scene for his own bashing, being over-critic about a (like he recognized) stupid thing, about himself.

At the same time I started listening to Goggins.  1- Since then, I started running and lost 22 lbs. I started registering for races and I am increasing my personal records every damn week. 2- I also started doing calesthenics. I am starting to see muscles on my body I didn't know they existed. 3- I also started a podcast because of my fear of public speaking. 4- Finally, I started to learn ski. I was born and raised in Africa, never skiied or ice skated in my whole life. I fell numerous times the first day. I sticked to it, went back, took lessons, went back again, trained on my own. My plan is to ride a blue or black slope by the end of the winter season.  Why did I mention my boyfriend? Because monday, he came back from work and witnessed me walking on my hands for the first time, and he said I was a beast! Then yesterday, he looked at me and said: you told me you always quit, you lied to me. Everything I see you doing you are sticking with it and you have a great discipline. It melted my heart.

@martynawlodarczyk9828,"Three reasons why I believe your audience would benefit from an episode on OCD and ERP:   1️⃣ OCD is much misunderstood as a disorder, which keeps people from getting help. If you were to speak about the disorder on Huberman Lab, people with OCD symptoms would be better equipped to understand their own brains and seek specialised therapy   2️⃣ ERP is a type of therapy based on encouragement, facing your fears, becoming a stronger & more disciplined personality, and on virtuosity in noticing, naming, and feeling emotions. While most often used as treatment for OCD symptoms, most of the population would improve their mental health & gain courage if they knew of ERP and practiced it   3️⃣ finally, OCD awareness within the society and ERP therapy availability are undergoing a major shift due to the services of NOCD, an online platform with ERP-trained therapists and an excellent clinical research team led by Dr Patrick McGrath  Thank you in advance for considering this as a topic of one of your future episodes.",1년 전,0,

@teamhop,"Hey I’ve got some really great news to share with you, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on a cross and resurrected on the third day so you may all have eternal life. If you believe and repent of your sins and put your faith and trust in Him as you would a parachute jumping off a plane at 25000 feet up in the air, He will give you eternal life in heaven as a free gift and I promise you, He will change your life forever as He did mine. He is the ONLY way to heaven and He loves you all. Please think deeply about this with urgency because this is your eternal life and soul, you don’t know when you could die, meaning you could die at any moment, so please consider this with all your heart. If anyone tells you that Jesus isn’t the only way, they are lying to you and they don’t care about your future.",1년 전,0,

If you believe and repent of your sins and put your faith and trust in Him as you would a parachute jumping off a plane at 25000 feet up in the air, He will give you eternal life in heaven as a free gift and I promise you, He will change your life forever as He did mine. He is the ONLY way to heaven and He loves you all. Please think deeply about this with urgency because this is your eternal life and soul, you don’t know when you could die, meaning you could die at any moment, so please consider this with all your heart.

@JohnTavastian," @Kal-EL_Volta  when you start self improvement you give yourself these goals you want to reach. Let's take ""getting in shape"" for an example. Your dream body is the carrot and the work you need to do is the stick. Well you work your ass off and eventually get your dream body, what now?

@Kal-EL_Volta,"@JohnTavastian  I got questions regarding ice baths. I believe he said that ice baths increase dopamine levels by 250%.  Wouldn't a spike in dopamine with ice baths lower the dopamine baseline when not engaging in ice baths, similar to drugs?  Wouldn't the spike in dopamine make the neurons reduce the amount of dopamine receptors to balance out the spike? Does high amounts of dopamine overwork and kill neurons? If not, why does meth or cocoaine seem to cause neuro decay?",1년 전,0,
@JohnTavastian, @Kal-EL_Volta  I'm not smart enough to answer this question but this is what I know. Keep in mind I don't have sources to confirm. If I remember correctly Huberman one time talked about dopamine and how ice baths affected it. The ice bath doesn't affect the dopamine baseline but it does spike it and it's not a bad thing. There are 2 ways of getting dopamine. Easy and hard. Easy ways are things like social media and junk food. Things you don't need to put much effort into to get dopamine. These things are bad for your dopamine because you get it too easily and too much. Which increases your baseline and makes it harder to do actually difficult things. The hard ways to get dopamine are things like ice baths. They are good for you and they fix a messed up dopamine baseline to it's natural levels,1년 전(수정됨),0,
@Kal-EL_Volta,"@JohnTavastian  awesome, thank you. It's good to know that hard work gets you the benefits of dopamine increase without affecting your baseline.

Does this applies to a job since one may not like it but keeps putting in the work. Asking to know if because of you are obliged to go to work this does not make this brain part grow or simply not as much as one doing things they dont like to do but they want to do so like a diet working out and so fourth....

Okay now be disciplined toward that end. Grow and live outside your comfort zone toward that end. And have the discipline to be upbeat and not all Debby downer like David. Work doesn't make you a Debby downer unless you let it by not disciplining your mind.   And it is simple to know why those millionaires and billionaires feel like they are missing something. It is because they have NO goals.  Their goals are probably things they already know how to do. That's a dumb goal. Do it if you want but don't call it a goal.

Effort alone is necessary but not sufficient. 56:36 💡 The feeling of missing something in life often stems from not exploring one's full potential, which requires unlocking hidden aspects through willpower, courage, and self-examination. 59:34 🔄 Lack of friction in the lives of the wealthy or successful can lead to unfulfillment and missed opportunities for growth. The stick and being haunted drive continuous improvement. 01:00:33 🏋️‍♂️ Building willpower involves consistently doing things you don't want to do. The commitment to continuous improvement keeps the willpower strong and the anterior mid-cingulate cortex active. 01:13:04 🌄 Embrace the harsh reality of change; personal transformation requires inner awakening and a genuine desire for improvement. 01:17:44 🔄 Some individuals can rapidly change their habits when they truly want it, flipping the switch in their mindset.

@clairelee4597,"I've gained many valuable insights from this discussion. I'm particularly fascinated by the idea of creating friction involved in hard work, especially in its relation to the functioning of the anterior mid-cingulate cortex. This leads me to wonder: could we speculate that recovered addicts may have larger anterior mid-cingulate cortices? As we all know, addiction recovery involves a significant and continuous effort to resist cravings even after one reaches a post-recovery phase. Thus, it seems plausible that the daily struggle faced by recovered addicts could lead to significant stimulation and potential growth in this brain region. If this is proven true, the finding will be counterintuitive as addiction is often associated with an assumption that individuals struggling with it have compromised brain regions related to willpower rather than enhanced ones.   On a separate note, Goggins seems to view ""hacks"" as shortcuts or attempts to circumvent hard work. To me, they're not mutually exclusive; that is, working smart using some ""hacks"" doesn't always prevent people from working hard. Those hacks can help people to reduce barriers preventing them from putting in the effort they need to. I think we need to be cautious of this type of messaging, as there are individuals who can genuinely benefit from certain tools or smart strategies to bring themselves to where they can actually work hard. For people living with significant barriers, you need tools as well as willpower. Ironically people who're accomplished despite challenging circumstances are quick to dismiss this reality.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

Now I can fully understand Goggins, maybe some years ago I would have said indeed “what is he talking about?”. It’s there, inside us, not outside us, but I will be always grateful for the internet as all my mentors are out there in this world sharing the knowledge and from which I have learned that after gaining the knowledge it’s time for action, and that is the real GOLD.

That's why it's the best answer he could've given somebody that is in a situation he formerly found himself in. If someone came sitting next to him and said ""oh you are a piece of shit?.... Okay I feel really bad for you. Im sorry you feel that way"" do you think it wouldve made it likely for him to take steps forward?

@tayeba01," @zakarianafiee  Salah can be refreshing and kind of therapeutic, but it can also be extended to helping the anterior mid-cingulate cortex. Take reciting lengthy surahs for example. It's a bit hard for most to recite long verses. Even though our prophet did it all the time, but these days, we tend to opt for shorter ones; even imams do this because most people don't have the patience to pray that long. So, if you engage in lengthy prayers, then I'm sure it helps the anterior mid-cingulate cortex, as you're going against your will to pray longer when your mind might want that extra time to scroll on social media.",1년 전(수정됨),4,

Please think deeply about this with urgency because this is your eternal life and soul, you don’t know when you could die, meaning you could die at any moment, so please consider this with all your heart.

@PircherReid,"I've only listened to the first half hour so far. I have a lot of respect for Goggins. I also noted his unhealthy core belief ""I'm not smart"" and wondered - based on who's definition? What's 'smart' mean? He's very intelligent. I couldn't help but wonder how his perspective might change if he started to notice when he said such things about himself and paused to change the narrative. We are all capable of intelligence and we each learn in our own way. Also hearing his expressed thoughts around how much running sucks. Again I wonder how he might feel if instead of waking up each day and thinking ""running sucks"", he applied gratitude ""I am so grateful that I get to run each day and stay this fit and on the top of my game"". I'm a big believer in conscious language shifts and I would love to see Goggins find more joy in his life, he deserves it. Also - the revising one page over and over till it's rote-learned - I used to think I had to learn that way too and eventually realised actually if I push past the perfectionism and read through it, even if it doesn't make sense, and continue to consume multiple resources on the same topic that actually the terms keep recurring, explained in slightly different ways and contexts, and learning this way was more fun. Goggins if you ever read this, I would encourage you to give it a try. Just keep powering through multiple resources on the same topic till it makes sense. Also helps with critical thinking when sources vary slightly. Also, if you do read this, thank you for the mental cookie jar analogy from your book.

Again, I really haven't confronted that thought in past materials from Goggins, so maybe it was just a one-off here. There was a lot of vague commentary regarding his attitude, but I didn't hear anything specific. Maybe I am missing the point here and I am humble enough to accept that.

He lets the work break is disciplined thinking. The work doesn't MAKE you sound like that. Lack of discipline does. I know he's goggins and I'm just here in the comments but I am right about it if you study attitude and think about it. That is his 1 blind spot. But talks about it. He says the inner voice you walk around with all day long. But yet he still thinks in such a dark way. The work doesn't suck. The work is the only reason your Goggins now. It's a gift. But you have to train and discipline yourself to think that way.,1년 전,0,

At the end of the day I'll smoke a joint or take a drink while he's out there running again because I'm not afraid. Life is too short to hate it all the time.  I feel like Goggins is gonna hit a point eventually. Like 5, 20, or maybe even 40 years from now he's going to develop a happier and brighter mindset than what he has now and there's a good chance it'll be because he hurts himself going too hard as people who goo too hard tend to do.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

Face all of the dark, terrifying, ugly, disgusting, demented, traumatic, sickening, horrible parts of your past, mind, heart and soul. Be real with it all - with yourself. Be honest. Take inventory of what's in those cupboards, in the dungeons, and put in the work to clean them out. ""The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek"" - Joseph Cambell.

@Gangasudhan,Just a couple of questions on the area of the brain that expands as a result of executing on things that one does not want to do. 1) What is the impact or consequence of the area expanding/growing? Does it result in some tangible change because the area gets bigger or is it just the physical representation of the behavioural or attitudinal change? 2) Does the action need to be something that the person forces themself to do (e.g. I do not want to go running today but I'm going to force myself to do it anyway) or can it be someone else forcing them to do it (e.g. I don't want to do Maths drills but I am compelled by my parent to sit down and practice)?

@osornito,"I hear David's main point: ""It's up to you"".   While that's useful, I do feel that there is this pressure to be ""great"" and I feel like this is why people like Andrew become famous because they send this message that it is possible for everyone to be great. I think everyone can be better, but not everyone can be great. Otherwise, great wouldn't be a thing.   I bow to the self-discipline and determination that people have to change. Being someone who has had to go through a huge change in my life through personal will, I also wanted to become great. Over time, it has become a burden that never stopped haunting me. Making me feel like nothing will ever be enough. I do feel like it has become a sort of obsession to ""be great"", especially in the Western world. Especially in North America.  You don't HAVE to be great. That is the one thing I'd say that both Andrew and David get stuck on. I understand it's very hard to detach your worth from what you do, but again... you don't HAVE to be great. If being great is your only focus, were you really great at something, or just great at being great? How did you treat your neighbour today? Did you open the door for someone today? How about a smile at a stranger? A helping hand to someone who you know can't do anything for you?   I think this collective obsession with being great stems from a place of scarcity that society emposes on us, in one way or another.   Let's all help each other become great...

At 15 years old (I am now a 56 year old woman with a life that I not only feel proud of, but love) a doctor told me that mental hospitals are filled with people who never fail. He was talking to me. I took that to heart. Also, Goggins reminds me a bit of Diana Nyad who swam from Cuba to Florida. The sentiment of her motivation being ...If I already went through hell then this hard thing is nothing compared to that. I'd love to hear you interview her. Last, thank you for educating me/us about the anterior mid cingulate cortex. I am now headed into a deep dive to know more about this area of the brain! I love it and your show!

@Jellyna__,"Oh dear Andrew 🥺🥰 I've been listening to your episodes since 2020, almost from the very beginning and I've loved every single one I've heard!   Those first series, that have been just you and your lessons about neurobiology and it's mechanisms,  have helped me so much to understand better my mind & body! I've improved my life a lot thanks to your sharing ❤️🙏   In general, I tend to listen to your podcast in waves/seasons, when i get super excited, stunned and inspired, by all the knowledge i gain, to change my life hahah and i actually do!  At first, I didn't like that many guest episodes cause i preferred your way of transmitting the knowledge. But, after listening to many guests episodes and this one now, I got so touched by the way you show up  in each of them (and i guess, just the way you are). Especially in this one and the episode with Robert Green.   You know, to me you are a kind of mentor just as Robert has been to you, said that, to hear the excitement in your voice and to see you so hyped to have Robert Green and David Goggins on your podcast feels like you are revealing the human part out from the super disciplined scientist.  And that feels so good, so true, vulnerable, honest, real, I LOVE IT! I guess Goggins with his way of being has made you reveal a bit more of that. After listening to this episode i feel like I got to meet that hidden part of the mentor. The feeling is like the one you get when you see the most respected and tough professor from the university in your favourite bar, dancingand drinking. It's like wow, there is something more to what we've seen at the uni, this person is also fun and vulnerable, has it's own problems and difficulties. I mean, we know now that's the case with everyone kind of... But yeah i felt it and got so touched by you being just a human who, apart from knowing everything you share, also struggles to keep up with everything, all the protocols and has felt lost as well multiple times in your life before figuring out what works for you. Just as Goggins, just as most of us human beings..   Thank you Andrew for showing up also in this way on your podcast! And thank you David for being so open and tough haha ❤️",1년 전,4,
@FaraEveBarnes-e5h,"Is there willpower in choosing your words wisely? Comparing Rick Rubin podcast interview to this one Rick’s intentionality, level of consciousness, and words chosen wisely from the mind of a professional creator vs professional survivor of life can be measured in Hz to carry more positive impact on influencing the world. While I like some aspects of this podcast there is a point where your own energy as the host becomes submissive to the domination of David’s thoughts, words, and energy that you begin to narrow focus on validating his belief system to the degree that you put him on a pedestal and then start using science to support his belief system as the way people need to be for a successful or worthy life. There’s a fine line between high performance and sociopathy, and after spending decades of my life in the field with people at the world class level, that type if dominance over others using pain as reward resulted in damage to or loss of life in others from a place of self and other hatred. Living your life perceiving yourself or others as pieces of shit may be effective for increasing one’s willpower and bank account but it’s not healthy for one’s nervous system because it’s an addiction to the hormones of stress that keeps us tethered to the lower emotions of anger, shame, self and other hatred. It’s useful to the military for warfighting but not something that should be put on a pedestal because it can be measured via sound waves and light frequencies in Hz as dissonance (more and more effort and energy that creates patterns of opposing forces). The opposing forces are already here in this natural environment. We evolve to harness our brain, body, conscious, and energy so that we are not stuck in states of survival and being a victim of our environment or circumstance. Yet this podcast is riddled by a victimhood energy that was harnessed for war and became the operating system that is the comfort zone David perceives himself to reign over. Clearly success can come from operating this way especially in survival and military or emergency situations but that is not the reflection of an evolving brain in balance or growing in a way that it’s designed for the human potential and a potential which flows positive impact outwards without also flowing equally destructive and opposing forces. David is in battle with himself 24/7 and he’s developed the willpower to survive his operating system but that is not a brain at its highest potential or an expression of human excellence that elevates the world or lives around it. It’s surviving and dominating and I wish you realized that and could have helped him grow and reorganize his operating system using neurobiology and neuroscience advancements vs reinforcing and putting the imbalance on a pedestal. I am a service connected disabled military veteran and a world record holder athlete, and my experience comes from combat wounded research expeditions as a team leader as specialty care provider technologist and inventor along with Pentagon best practices in resilience and rehabilitation to peak performance from a whole body/whole human perspective.",1년 전,1,

@FaraEveBarnes-e5h," @l.w.paradis2108  David wires and fires the synapses of a past trauma neural network and debilitated level of mind - which he calls a piece of shit loser. Every time he does that he activates survival emotions and hormones which rebuilds that past trauma neural network in the present. He then has to consume himself with harnessing his time, energy, and relationships to operate and survive himself. It feels to him like he along with the world and people in it are all obstacles, threats, and struggles with victims, predators, and losers he despises with the same level of mind and decades of self and other hatred survival states outside of true survival feeds. I feel immense compassion for his battle but I have been a team leader and specialty care provider on combat wounded research expeditions and a world record holder athlete who knows what science and technology advancements have shown us we must do to evolve beyond this unsustainable battle within. I see that you are a teacher. There is an epidemic of student deaths from misunderstanding what is needed for humans to process the stress, trauma, and mental health issues across our nation. It’s not blah, blah, blah… it’s our society’s habituation to the hormones of stress and lack of awareness especially regarding youth brain and nervous system development following Covid 19. I offered my insight because I experienced IRB level scientific research in the field outside of an academic controlled environment. Many of disabled veterans have these issues with learning, studying, and more that Goggins has, because modern unconventional warfare activates a continuous survival state of mind. The Pentagon’s best practices for evolving beyond this you vs you battle within have been extensively funded because we have a high rate of suicide among veterans. There is no reason to support that mindset for anyone outside of high threat and tactical professionals.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

@1Dickhead23,"This was so amazing. Until it wasn't. I love everything this podcast stands for (that I have heard so far). I listened to over two hours of this podcast thinking David Goggins is beyond fucking amazing. He ONLY finds his worth when he creates and OWNS it. That's fucking incredible and true. Until you stop there......  I'm so thankful the relationship question was asked. I happened to have the same beliefs when it comes to relationships. That being said....... Goggins response of ""he makes sure everyone he cares for is well taken care of so they LEAVE HIM THE FUCK ALONE...."" that comment completely trumped the entire podcast. He has no one. I stopped it right there. And I'm not sure I will ever listen again. Life sucks. It will always suck and I appreciate the realness of that entire dialog. But he is SOLELY living for himself. Teaching other people to ALWAYS be as self-centered as he needs himself to be to LIVE his life to what he believes is its FULLEST will NOT EVER get another individual to where they need to be. Life is about figuring out how to overcome/ process/ recover/grieve/defeat failure. But it will NOT move in any kind of direction without success in some form of love for someone (any form of life) else. It's no wonder so many people go back to their addiction. Some aspect or form of a person's life HAS to be worth living for. Not just living to feel confident in a room full Rich intelligent self absorbed people.",1년 전(수정됨),2,

@jewlstah2010,"“One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious. The latter procedure, however, is disagreeable and therefore not popular.” -Carl Jung. Others have preached similar messages than David, but not to his level of ""madness,"" for lack of words. What he embodies is particularly special. I will say that, as a woman, I resonate with what he says, but I apply what he says differently. I’m not ever going to go through Seal training (duh) and I'm not going to be running 30 miles a day; I don’t want to and don’t feel bad about that. I am accessing this new level of mental fortitude by going immensely deep in the “dungeon,” as Goggins refers to it, and cleaning it out. This requires MASSIVE amounts of pain that have caused me to break down on nearly every level; to the point where death was far more favorable. But I NEVER fucking gave up on myself. I pulled myself out of the fucking muck and mire of life and came out of it as a ravenous fucking animal. The trauma that I felt for SO long did not get the best of me. I REFUSE to be a victim. We cannot ""heal"" or become fortresses if refuse to access the fucking DEPTHS of our pain. We have to SIT in our pain. We have to become one with it and accept it. We cannot just numb our pain w/ substances or anything else, for that matter; anything can be used as a crutch. We cannot heal if we refuse to listen to the ""negative""/ constructive feedback of others. We need to call out OUR OWN SHIT. We need to take accountability of how fucking shitty we can be and DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I have learned that I will never compromise my truth for anyone or anything. That truth sets me free day after day. And the work NEVER stops. In David's words, ""Stay hard.""",1년 전(수정됨),0,

Growing up poor with limited resources and an overwhelmed single-mother in a third world country to moving to a completely different culture and geography. Dealing with the hardships of having to learn a language while balancing school, a dysfunctional family and being bullied and underestimated my whole childhood and teenage years through.  I'm a 30 year old ongoing doctor now. I'm surrounded every day by people who's life was predesigned from the very beginning while I'm fighting every day to become someone I was not supposed to become.

So l %100 get where goggins is coming from as on a daily basis I have to live and overcome that part of myself which is the weak part of myself , the part that hates and bullies me. It’s something that can’t be turned off at times it can be a whisper and other times shouting in my mind 24/7  and yeah it can make me feel like what’s the point ? So I have started to implement consistent routines of exercise, meditation , prayer , eating and drinking properly and generally adopting the idea that there is a higher power out there that’s greater than me.

Sorry if I'm misinterpreting his words here. I'll try to make notes of what was said in that part, because I thought that information is worth gold - and it was Goggins who spent years and years fighting to get this gold and to bring it back and share it to us, which I'm very grateful for.",1년 전,0,

But it's entirely unclear why Goggins excludes the female sex from being real and authentic in a human to human capacity around the 2 hr mark. He says something to the effect of 'man to man, women totally won't understand this...'   What he's speaking about it is the capacity to be real and to be seen - the capacity to be who you say you are. I wish Huberman would've pushed back on this a bit. The ability and innate human desire to be real with yourself isn't exclusive to the male sex.",1년 전,1,

@antoinereymere557,"Really appreciating this conversation for a lot of different reasons. I have some thoughts and opinions I feel the need to express and a lot of questions for Goggins, some of which I don’t believe have definitive answers, and might be a bit rhetorical, but in any case I feel the need to ask them anyway.   So, from the outside looking in it seems as though Goggins has found some level of joy in the willful engagement between his Self and friction, or tension; that Goggins has found a certain peace in the misery of reality; maybe this Goggins even finds some joy in the internal praise, that is given by himself, for his accomplishments in the conquest to overcome and persevere in the face of adversity. It feels as though maybe that is the carrot on the stick. That despite the sticks use in consistently assaulting him and his persons. That maybe there is actually a carrot at the end of the stick that is yet to be seen?  It makes me wonder if the Goggins that we know, who learns to overcome and persevere in the face of adversity, would find same passion in moving that battle of will internally? I guess I wonder, would that not be the ultimate adversity for a world that seems to have been conquered externally? If it is true that the Goggins we know, has found success in his achievements through his approach, is it not also true that this same Goggins, to some degree, can find and recognize patterns of systems that work seamlessly to give you consistent and reproducible results?   Is it not also true that this Goggins is consistently building his kingdom from The base up, daily? If that is the case, then is it not also true that this Goggins can find fluidity in these daily practices, finding ease in the certain knowns and unknowns of that process? If this Goggins has found practical use of repetition and patterns - practices, then is it not the case that this Goggins can find a greater speed and momentum in the execution of those practices? That there’s always more space and time available in its infinite state? Putting down block after block in this routine way, at an almost inconceivable speed? Is it not also true, that in this very way this Goggins would in fact always be keeping what works and discarding what doesn’t? And in that, can it be assumed that some of this Goggins truth would be in his ability to refine this process infinitely with ease?   That makes me also wonder this; is it also the case that a truth of this Goggins is to gain access to, what seems like, inaccessible spaces? If this is the case, then I wonder if it would be that this Goggins might eventually use that same force of will to find and explore the basis of this Goggins - His - internal framework? His emotions, his thought process, his awareness, his empathy, his sympathy, his anger, his compassion, his passion, is love, his joy, his peace, etc. and fortify those same things in the way that this Goggins has fortified his will. Is it not that this Goggins is in fact the life long study of his Self? Is it not the case that his every piece is a crucial component to that study? Is not his health, his function, his consistency, his effortless ease of efficiency, not also a focus of practice in the study of that Goggins?  It seems also that a part of this Goggins experience is to unveil his inner potential from the seat of his will.(?) And if that is true, then would it not be the case that unveiling and developing the reoccurrence of these states: of paralleling emotions, thought processes, awareness, empathy, sympathy, etc. would be another unveiling of it’s own? Is not the fluid use of these, with the momentum of action, not also a goal? Would it not benefit that Goggins to have all hands available in the battle of his own mind? all internal enemies turned allies? all the parts taken care of, with that same care to family, so that the true Goggins can do his work?   Is it not like that of an internal kingdom being worked with? Would it not benefit that Goggins - You - to also develop a more fluid and direct form of communication with these internal voices? If there is a two way dialogue happening, is it not the case that these voices are just as flexible in their approach of communication as you are? Does that not also mean that you can develop and change the relationship with these inner voices? As to see them as allies, albeit from the sounds of it maybe not always so helpful, but friends nonetheless; as to make peace with them, as to collaborate, as to cooperate, as to find a level of communication that is heard as helpful suggestions in favor of this kingdom you are building in spite of their resistance - this kingdom of heart. Is it not also the case that in working with people that seem to be unworkable, unchangeable, immovable, that you would be in some way working with an external representation of your own internal voices?   As to see that there is change available to even the most stubborn of forces? That you have the potential to move this immovable force through your work in the study of you - in the study of your Self. Is it not also the case then that these inner voices could to take on a synthesized version of the characteristics of all of the mentors that you didn’t have, all of the support you weren’t given, by working with these individuals in this way? Is it not the case that these voices are in fact modular pieces of a whole You, that they too have a place at the seat of your Self? Can they not also learn to drive as you have? Can they not also be allowed to take on you as the mentors that they’ve never had? Is it not symbiotic in this way?  If it is to be said that the mind is malleable, flexible, and potentially limitless, then could not those same very violently opposed voices be worked with in changing their tone, delivery, and the brashness of their communication? Are they not as capable as you are in their own ability to adapt, make changes, and grow from the experiences that have been given?   If what you are expressing here is that the mind is ultimately the only real adversary? Then would it not benefit this Goggins to have access to all of the components of it, if not only just to see how the systems of them work? If not only to just admire how complex they are, and how little we know of them?  I also wonder if as you enter the dungeon of your psyche daily, as you have established yourself also as an occupant of this dungeon, is it also the case that you have built a barracks there, a home of sorts? And I wonder if that is the case, do you not also roam the other areas of your kingdom? Are you not also the people that occupy this space? Are you not also the judge, jury, and executioner at the gallows of your own thoughts? The civilians that occupy the space of you? The trades and markets, the shops and crafters, the goods and grains, the libraries, the theaters, the sounds, the wind, the animals and critters, the lakes and rivers. Do you not also dine at the seat of your own table, built with your own hands, and enjoy a meal from the fruits of your own labor, to nourish yourself for the unseen battles of tomorrow? And do you not also rest in the bed that you have made? This kingdom that you maintain daily, is it not also your sanctuary?  In thinking about this particular Goggins, I envision that even if this imaginary kingdom were to be just a rooted tree, that this Goggins would have it a home that could be occupied by any wayward soul. That its purpose and meaning would be practical and available to their awareness almost immediately, with no real question about what is what. That its intention would be displayed in its function, things being as they are, for what they are, and for what they are needed for, and everything in its right place.   I seem to also imagine that the paths you may have forged leading to this place, although not readily accessible, can be taught and learned. I imagine you as a guide in that way. To others who have wandered astray, or are finding a way. I see also you building tools in much of the same way, adding to the knowledge of what is possible and the effectiveness around that possibility. I also see this compression and denseness in that gravity of your practice. A sort of reforming of yourself as opposed to a stretched expansion of it.   Thanks for sharing a part of your Journey with us like that. I feel like I might be missing a lot here, but I don’t really know. I don’t really know much about anything, to be honest. Probably just talking to myself for the most part. Projecting maybe? I don’t know, but I appreciate hearing your perspective. I can only imagine that it adds a positive force to the perceivable world, despite the nature of its coming into being. Which brings up thoughts for me of various themes, from various myths and folklore that I’ve heard over the years. It loosely brings to mind creation myths for whatever reason.",1년 전,0,

@resistapathy,"I've seen people close to me who have had too develop strong wills- like my husband because of Tourrette's  and my mother who survived the Holocaust as a child- also develop a negative characteristic a long with the strong will. They overdo it and physically hurt themselves. My husband will go into like a manic phase and have to finish something- but he overdoes it and gets a muscle injury of weakens his immune system and gets sick. My mom would do too much gardening in the hot weather, for example, and make herself sick. And Goggins seems to be this way as well. Its something to watch out for. Maybe those people with strong wills don't have an early alarm system to say- 'watch out, you're reaching your limit- slow down so you have the capacity to push it to the limit another day'. Yes, others may think they are at that point too early, but not paying attention to when you might hurt yourself is not a good strategy for me either. I want to keep my legs- knees hips etc- healthy so I can run as long as possible- because I love running. The way Goggins is- he reminds me of when my daughter was starting to push herself out of me. I was starting to get those contractions and I had to concentrate to work through the pain. I had a nice lady come to talk to me during that time, but she was just distracting me from my concentration to get through the pain. I was walking a fine line, and she was pushing me off it. That is what I feel Goggins is like. He knows it won't take much to push him off his fine line of control. He needs to constantly keep up strong defenses and he can't be distracted from it. He needs to devote a lot of resources to not slipping. So he doesn't have that much to give to other areas. Like considering if being a SEAL and reinforcing the US empire around the world is a worthy use of his effort.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

It means to me trying to find like minded people to improve our lives and lessening the needless suffering of others.

Emotional dysregulation is a hallmark of ADHD, which I know from the scientific literature and personal experience. My family and I  are on the spectrum of ADHD (some members having it worse than others).  When that passion is harnessed you can achieve a lot- for good or evil.

@resistapathy,"My husband has Tourette's syndrome. His symptoms at there worst were stuttering, making noises, and moving his body in ways that can hurt after a while (like moving his head as if he is getting hair out of his eyes). He also has an iron will- he is Iron Man- and I think it is because he had to learn to try to control his Tourette's to escape ridicule. He had to constantly do something that was difficult for him- control his body. But it gave him an iron will and allowed him to escape his addictions when he decided to (when he began a family and didn't need to escape). I asked him when he started to control himself. The involuntary movements got worse at puberty. He has learning disabilities and only graduated middle school in Taiwan. He had to go out to work at 14. Before the age of 14, he would beat up kids if anyone made fun of him, and fighting felt good to him. But at 14 when he went out to work and his co-workers would ask why he always moved his head weird, he had to control his anger or be out of a job. So from that time he worked on self-control. He has complete control and discipline over his body- his Tourette's manifests more weakly now, but I think that is a function of age. At 60 years old he looks like a gymnast and regularly works out hours a day. Our daughters also have learning disabilities and had to work harder than others. My oldest recently tried to run for 24 hours straight- she had it to 15 hours I believe. She was number one in her high school class but told me others could do  it if they worked as hard as she did. I do think there is something innate in my husband and oldest daughter that is not just born out of facing hardship. I am a teacher and see how a lot of students struggle. Some naturally push more. There is something there that is a gift I believe. Maybe we can all work hard and face hurdles, but some will get to the realization that they need to keep pushing  faster than others. And they will enjoy or habituate to the struggle more than others.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

@painleasure,"The summary of the video in 10 points  1) Self-Reflection and Internal Dialogue:  Spend time in introspection to understand your own thoughts and emotions. Develop a two-way internal dialogue, acknowledging both positive and negative aspects.  2) Facing Challenges:  Embrace challenges as opportunities for growth and self-improvement. Understand that life is a series of tests, and facing adversity is part of the journey.  3) Taking Ownership:  Take full responsibility for your life and actions. Avoid blaming external factors; focus on what you can control.  4) Embrace Discomfort:  Success often lies outside your comfort zone. Embrace discomfort willingly and view it as a path to personal development.  5) Daily Discipline:  Establish a daily routine that includes self-discipline. Consistency in your actions, even in small things, leads to long-term success.  6) Introspective Cleaning:  Regularly go inward and address the deep-seated issues or fears in your life. Be brutally honest with yourself and confront your inner demons.  7) Resilience and Perseverance:  Understand that failures are part of the journey to success. Learn from failures, and use them as stepping stones toward your goals.  8) Avoiding External Distractions:  Limit external distractions, such as excessive social media and unnecessary commitments. Create focused periods where you can work on your personal growth without interruptions.  9) Overcoming Fear:  Confront and overcome your fears by facing them head-on. Understand that fear is a natural part of growth and achievement.  10) Continuous Learning:  Approach life as a constant learning experience. Be open to gaining insights from various sources and apply them to your personal development.",1년 전,3,
@amandaleigh6556,"Cannot thank you both enough for this. I’ve had plenty of encounters with the demons of my past, the traumatized self, the CPTSD episodes and coming to terms with what exactly it will take to push beyond the black and become my true self. I’ve described it as breaking myself down to the child I was before the years of torture and terror to regrow myself from that place, and become the woman i was supposed to be. I’ve described it as living lifetimes beyond my 41 years to get where i am, but trying to keep in the present. The “haunting stick, no carrot”, nothing has ever rang so true. But I don’t clean out those cabinets everyday; I do try to put the past in the past and THAT IS what makes me complacent or lazy even though I feel like I’m always grinding through, it’s definitely not my full potential.

I also have sleeping issues and found other ways to help, even if the sleeping issues are actually caused by a brain issue so his advice would not be feasible and he is not the owner of the truth, neither is Goggins. But they do act like it. I find the mental environment of self obsession they create to be extremely toxic, specially to men who now seem to have no joy in life, it’s all about controlling stuff at every step, like reinforcing OCD on people. I find it worrying that I see so many men under 30 obsessed with these two and their advice and lacking care for others. I have seen so many following the advice given by these two while growing distant from the ones they should care for the most. Not good at all.

And the secret to my willpower? just do it!”  I mean, really? Every day since a teenage  just doing the hard and painful thing and never ever slipped and doubted yourself?  What’s the inner deeper dialogue when you do the hard shit everyday? What’s the exact journey of losing 300 pounds?

@enlightentheload,Andrew I can't thank you enough for this and have to share my immense appreciation and gratitude -- it's changing my life. I'm a new counselor and feel now that it's okay to recognize that radical self love isn't enough... I don't see that being the case for my clients and it's definitely not true for me. I have ADHD and in a big way have been sitting on the question of whether it's worth fighting so hard to achieve what feels like my own version of self actualization. I feel awakened and validated now to channel my own similar strain of inner crazy (HA!) which I disowned a long time ago in the name of self acceptance. It's been so beautiful to reclaim that part of myself and I can't believe now that this ever even felt like a question. It's such a relief to know that a big chunk of my life can just fucking SUCK and that this isn't just a part of my journey but an important requirement that gets me to where I need to be.

@jbrkjferkjbekjb,"Trying to classify goggin’s experience as ‘stick vs carrot’ oversimplifies it. I think his stick has also become his carrot, or maybe it’s neither a stick nor a carrot but just him going into action every single day, if that makes sense. But I have to believe that it’s not all stick as clearly he feels rewarded (not feeling empty but fulfilled) and is constantly training for that ‘reward’ (carrot).  Also David’s methodology is unique to some but its philosophy is quite similar to eastern philosophy which focuses a lot on meditation, mindfulness, etc. Thai and Chinese monks would isolate themselves, meditate, and ‘clean’ their minds every single day. The difference here of course is that Goggins also goes out into the world and attempts extreme challenges to further push his boundaries and test himself.   The danger of course is that one who goes out into the world would get distracted by outside voices, etc. it’s the reason why monks ‘leave the world behind’. It is indeed not easy to stay disciplined to one’s own voice all the time in the outside world. It’s great that David knows the dangers of social media, and the pursuit of ‘success’, hence him limiting his exposure and ‘capping (the outside definition of) success’.",1년 전(수정됨),3,

Neither one is good at explaining it in terms that help others understand. In the case of Goggins, he seems annoyed by the people paying him money to explain. Even though he is the one putting himself forward as the exemplar who they want to mimic. Counting on Huberman to give us actual protocols on how to grow the anterior mid cingulate cortex and establish an internal dialog to overcome our aversions….",1년 전,0,

@LilAndrew90,"I feel this is the most hardcore I've ever seen David Goggins in a podcast and I've seen every single podcast he's been to. The ""Sorry I'm not sorry"" attitude and speech, the ""I've done all those things to become a strong man so that's why I don't feel sorry for you if you don't"" stuff and everything else have probably not been more badass delivered by David, ever. He detests mediocrity and doesn't shy away from telling us straight up that we either grind to become hard like him or we don't, that's it, it's our choice. No hidden agenda or mean intentions, David Goggins is 100% real. If now people don't understand what David Goggins is all about, not even after watching this, then it will probably never happen. He rarely does podcasts these days, he probably felt he said everything there is. I understood David right from the start, I've never been confused about his message, I've never seeing him like probably other people see him (a guy who only works out all day, run and yells at the camera), I knew from the beginning what part that had in everything. Because this is not all he does. It's just a part of his life. However, I feel that this group of people is small, from all the comments I've read. Majority of people get the point, some of them have started already doing stuff, losing weight etc. I'm glad to be part of a world where David Goggins exists. He is needed.",1년 전,80,

@thegemologist9574,"Autophagy is a cellular process that involves the degradation and recycling of damaged or dysfunctional cellular components. It plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, preventing the accumulation of damaged organelles and proteins, and promoting overall cellular health. Activating or increasing autophagy through daily cycles or triggers is important for several reasons, which can be explained through two key elements:      Cellular Repair and Maintenance:           Purpose: The primary function of autophagy is to remove and recycle cellular components that are damaged, misfolded, or dysfunctional. By activating autophagy regularly, the cell ensures the timely removal of these problematic components, promoting cellular repair and maintenance.           Significance: This process helps prevent the accumulation of cellular waste, which, if left unchecked, could lead to the development of various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Regular activation of autophagy is essential for cellular longevity and overall health.      Adaptation to Stress and Nutrient Scarcity:           Purpose: Autophagy serves as a cellular survival mechanism during periods of stress or nutrient scarcity. By breaking down cellular components and recycling their building blocks, the cell can generate energy and essential nutrients to support its functions during challenging conditions.           Significance: This adaptive response allows cells to endure periods of fasting, exercise, or other stressors, promoting resilience and survival. It is particularly important for tissues and organs with high energy demands, such as the brain and muscles.  Experimental and Researched Methods for Activating Autophagy:      Caloric Restriction:           Method: Limiting caloric intake without malnutrition.         Mechanism: Induces autophagy by mimicking nutrient scarcity, prompting cells to break down and recycle cellular components for energy.      Intermittent Fasting:           Method: Alternating periods of eating and fasting.         Mechanism: Triggers autophagy during fasting periods, promoting cellular cleanup and repair.      Physical Exercise:           Method: Regular aerobic and resistance exercise.         Mechanism: Exercise-induced stress activates autophagy, helping to remove damaged cellular components and promoting cellular adaptation.  Possible Autophagocytosis Based on Daily and Intense Physical Activity:      Daily Physical Activity:           Effect: Regular, moderate-intensity exercise stimulates autophagy.         Mechanism: Exercise-induced stress signals the need for cellular cleanup and repair, prompting autophagy to remove damaged components.      Highly Intense Physical Activity:           Effect: Intense workouts can further enhance autophagy.         Mechanism: High-intensity exercise increases cellular stress, promoting a more robust autophagic response to meet the increased demand for cellular repair and energy generation.      Post-Exercise Period:           Effect: Autophagy remains elevated post-exercise.         Mechanism: The post-exercise recovery period is characterized by continued autophagy, allowing cells to complete the cleanup and repair initiated during the workout. Adequate rest and recovery are crucial for optimal autophagy.",1년 전,0,

@ginagriffiths3677,"Andrew Huberman; David, you embody discipline and doing hard things. Right before we went to hot mics we were talking about learning and right now you are spending some time learning and doing things most people probably don’t associate David Goggins’ with so why don’t you tell us about it.  David Goggins; Most people just look at me at the guy that runs and yells as he’s running and while I do that to motivate people what people don’t understand is that my day is broken up into segments. I work out, I sleep, I eat but I spend most of my time studying. I’m in the medical world (paramedic in Canada) but i spend a lot of my time trying to nuke every single about it because I’m not just trying to be a paramedic and learn about veins, arteries and how the heart pumps and stuff like that. I’m trying to learn to the point where I can save someone’s life. Even though paramedics are doing that all over the world, I’m trying to be that paramedic that can dissect what’s really going on and figure out what medication goes where and just trying to learn the algorithm as to what’s going on man and I spend a lot of time doing that.  Andrew; I love the word algorithm because when I teach biology or try to learn anything that’s related to biology and especially the human body, I need to know the nouns but the verbs are what matter and that’s really what you are talking about. Because just by saying that brain part there etc. doesn’t tell you how it all works together. So what does your process for studying look like?   David; I’m not a real smart guy and what I mean by that is, I was born ADD (ADHD) and my brain can not retain information. I am not some genetic freak when it comes to running, learning etc., I am at the bottom of the barrel. So when you ask me this question on what does studying look like for me? I have to go over the same page over and over and over again while Jennifer can look at that page while she’s quizzing me and learn right there even though she doesn’t know anything about it. It’s the most frustrating thing how my brain works and so what I do is, I literally sit there with a pen and paper and i go through my books while writing everything down every single day I will repeat the same page until it is photographic memory from writing the same thing down and from there I go and relearn it again. So I learn the bulk of it but then I go and learn the small things within that. So if it’s a medication I first learn how to say the name of the medication, then I go through the dosage etcetera. And this is every single day. It’s not like “oh I got it”. Nothing is like “I got it”. Everything I do in life “it sucks”. Everything I do in life “it sucks”. That’s when I was 24 years old and 300 pounds there wasn’t some like “big epiphany” of let’s just go lose some weight and be a navy seal. No! I knew my entire life was gonna be a struggle which is why I just ignored it and I wasn’t even trying to jump off into this shit and learn how to read, how to write,how to memorize and how to become something I am not but through that process something happened to me and I realized, and this is the reason I feel sorry for nobody. In this podcast you are gonna really not like me because people are gonna think, that I am maybe lying or exaggerating. No! I was literally the lowest form on earth, no talent, no ability to learn and I literally know what it is to be rock bottom and build that up. So that question about learning is a pain in my ass and I don’t have to do it and that’s the thing about it. I’m 49 years old and a multi millionaire. I don’t have to do anything. All I thought about when I was growing up was “man I can’t wait to get to the point where I no loinger have to do this stuff” but as I got older it became a way of living. So how I do every day is how I do every day. It’s the discipline, the regimen and it was a choice I made. The choice I made was, what am I willing to sacrifice and what am I willing to give up to find every bit of who you are as a human being and I was willing to give up everything to do that. So studying is no joke.",1년 전,0,

@bradrtorgersen_videos,"David Goggins. The king of modern go-hard dig-it-out mentality preaching. Alas, for those of us on the Type B spectrum, Goggins is right. If you want to stretch way beyond your ordinary self—and achieve things you can truly be satisfied with—you just have to grind forward. Despite your emotional state. Despite whether you're ""in the zone"" or not. Force yourself to do the thing(s). Hate them in the moment, but do the action(s). I'm the laziest guy I know. Laziness is my middle name. But anything I've ever done in my life that I now point to with pride, is because I ignored how much I hated the thing(s) in the moment, and I made myself do the thing(s). And this is all it is.

My own experiences and rock bottom fade in comparison to Mr Goggins' but I somehow developed similar strategies to bring the locus of reward within. However, over the past 5 years, I lost that part of me. I felt broken and numb. Looking back, I have immense respect for that version of myself and I am now trying to build myself back up.   This episode helped me realize that my strategies were my strength.

After listening to this episode and the two about dopamine I have a question: How do you reconcile or what is the relationship between what you talked about in this podcast (growing the part of the brain affected by doing things you don't want to do) with the motivation dopamine gives.  I can't wrap my head around the benefit of doing something I don't want to increase that part of the brain, but also using dopamine to provide motivation, which would mean I'd want to do something.  Can the two be used together in some way, or are they at odds with one another?  To me it's a conundrum.  Thanks for everything you do on this podcast!",1년 전,1,

Some are our own worst bullies, so bad where we are sending ourselves into the grave with depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts etc. To the people who are already harsh on themselves this may not work, personally I only improved when I was kinder and forgiving to myself, including taking ADHD medication. I got did meditation, ate healthy, got beyond fit, none of it helped me mentally. It's my own personal anecdote but this type of mentality ruined me for most of my life. For the people that give 0 push, give 0 criticism to themself, too comfortable but unsatisfied with their life etc., then a lot of what he says makes sense.

@AnonymousUser-ys8ou,"Willpower and motivation, as understood from the many huderman videos:  Set rules, the longer you remain within their bounds, the farther the walls expand elsewhere.  Think of your mind like a fluid, as we know fluids cannot be compressed without exerting force outwards towards the path of least resistance  The path of least resistance when there are no rules is the path that fits the following criteria: 1. The most obvious results 2. The quickest results  3. The most intense results/experience 4. The most novel experiences 5. The most personally relevant/important experience/results  When looking at the rule free life we find that we become lazy.  Laziness is defined as ""unwilling to work or use energy""  In our current day life, work is highly valued, so work is important. (Because what is valued by others oftentimes improves self-esteem when achieving it)  You would think that if work is so important that everyone would go do it when taking the perspective that we will do what is important to us. The issue with this is, importance is only 1 part of the path of least resistance.   Other things such as social media, video games, drugs, are actually on the path of least resistance. Those types of things are often labelled as addictions, but really, anything is an addiction. Those things are labelled as addictions only because they do not fit into the value systems of others.   Really, what we call addiction is actually taking the path of least resistance. This makes sense though, people value work, and work is effort. No resistance takes no effort, of course the general population would look down on it.  In the past, the amount of resistance was relatively higher compared to today. Despite that, we find people are not super hard workers all around, which begs the question: is it the average resistance, or the min/max of resistance which is responsible for being able to work?  The answer to that question lies in a few areas, the first of which is in memory. Memories are encoded based on their (3,4) salience and novelty. So, we find that two low resistance factors lead to memory encoding. This is the survivorship bias at play here, what is not fitting of those low resistance factors are not making it home to our memory. Only the low resistance things are making it home, so they are what we remember and gauge our understanding of work/resistance on. In conclusion, the path of least resistance is the path most remembered.   Along with that, the most grueling task we have ever done is used to gauge our understanding of resistance. The hardest task on it's own fits the opposite of the following criteria: (2 and 3) as well as (1) which I will touch on later. The hardest task is usually long and it is something that lies at the extremes for experience in terms of struggle. One more important thing for memory is duration, the longer we are exposed to information, the more possible encodings can take place. Meaning, we remember our most grueling task well, and it informs our understanding of resistance as the maximum. The opposite of criteria (1) is the least obvious result, usually when results are not obvious, we need to add relevance to the task to go through with it. This self-induced relevance is often intrinsic motivation, the longest and most powerful form of motivation.  We now know, our understanding of resistance largely depends on our most and least resistant experience. So, to bring our understanding of resistance up, we have to either, remove low resistance tasks, or add more high resistance tasks.  This is where rules come in as a tool for reducing low resistance tasks. To set an effective rule, you must find things which fit the criteria for the path of least resistance, and forbid yourself from them (whether that is in frequency, duration, intensity, or by omission). Overtime, those memories of those low resistance activities will blur and the minimum for resistance increases to the next thing. This is a progressive strategy where you can omit more and more difficult to remove things, so there is no reason to stop. Everyone has already started this journey without thinking about it this way. We know there are certain limitations to what we can do, there are laws and experiences we avoided having/breaking because we know they are bad.   After the rules are set, it is time to find high resistance tasks to increase the maximum for resistance. Look for things that you don't want to do that are high resistance; for example your homework :/. After picking that thing, do it, as long or as intense as you can will yourself to do. It is important to just start it at all. If it is safe and won't damage you, that is all the planning you need, don't think about it, start that high resistance activity. Once you are used to doing the activity you can begin to think more about it and maximize your gains from it.  In conclusion, to work hard and avoid laziness, you need to adjust your max/min for resistance. Make the lowest resistance task higher resistance than others, and make the highest resistance task something you never thought you can do. Best of luck on your journey down the path of most resistance; make sure to not hurt others in the process. You matter, and are not the only one unable to motivate yourself.",1년 전,0,

@giosasso,"In the grand, unending conversation of science, there's this idea that's more like a secret whisper, really. Imagine, if you will, tearing a little hole right through space and time. It's the stuff of daydreams and deep, starlit discussions – this thought that we could just step through time like walking through a door, that reality could bend and twist, leading us down paths we've only seen in the intricate, spiraling universes of wormholes.  But let's be honest, it's mostly a bedtime story for physicists, isn't it? A beautiful, unreachable ""what if"" that lives in equations and science fiction novels.  Now, enter David Goggins. Imagine him stepping onto this stage of cosmic theories and starry-eyed hypotheses. He's not just a guy, you see; he's like a walking, talking challenge to the universe. He's where our neat, tidy laws of physics start getting sweaty palms and second thoughts.  Think of Goggins as this extraordinary anomaly, a man who doesn't just push the boundaries – he kind of laughs and leaps over them. It's as if he's got this secret map to places in time and space where the rules aren't the rules anymore. You know, like he's found a backdoor in the grand cosmic design.  It's almost as if he's out there, in the wilds of human potential, having a casual stroll through these theoretical minefields, making physicists scribble frantic notes and rethink their life choices.  This whole thing – it's more than just a chat about what's possible. It's like a campfire story where science and the raw, unbridled spirit of humanity sit down, share a drink, and talk about the universe. It's Goggins, with his feet planted firmly on the ground and his will reaching out into the realms of the impossible, showing us all a glimpse of what happens when you dare to ask, ""What if I just... go for it?""  And that's the beauty of it – it's a story that's as much about the stars and the mysteries of space as it is about the heart and the unexplored depths of the human spirit.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

I had no family to help me. I had no money. Literally at the bottom of the barrel… Somehow I found my inner strength. I dug deep!! I graduated high school in the hospital. I left the hospital in a wheelchair after three months. I started going to college. I hated it. I hated everything. I graduated number one in my class. Not number two… But number one. I dug deep. I got my first job. I was making more money than all of my friends. Here I was in a wheelchair. I did not stop! I kept going… Everyone started respecting me. The way people talked about me was something I never expected. I became this inspiration that I never set out to be. I exercise every single day… Pushing up hills in my wheelchair. 15 or 20 miles each day. Never stopping… I found that “thing” David is talking about. That inner voice that tells me “you cannot do it”. But I just fought that voice and created a new one! Everything I do now comes out on top. nobody can stop me — but me!",1년 전,115,

Another suggestion is George Mumford.

@Aetherius88," @sirtra  I didn't say people with Down's Syndrome don't attend regular school. They are generally in ""special"" classes. I'm just saying that general autism is more likely in this situation than Down's, which is the most severe form of autism. I've never known anyone with Down's Syndrome to excel in math.  Savant Syndrome, yes, but that's a different form of autism. I'd argue that if the individual in question here was in fact good at math that it would break the definition of Down's Syndrome. By definition they would be classified differently based on this skill and intelligence. There are several forms of Autism and it's simply more likely that the OP mixed up another form of autism with Down's. I'm just stating what is most likely.

@BlueCoore,"It’s interesting how Andrew was verbalizing exactly what I was getting from Goggins in this episode. Every single explanation from him, including the two-way dialogue nails Goggins mindset in the regarding of psychology.  Not that I’m a brilliant neuroscientist like Andrew so that we got the same brilliant analogies. But not that Andrew is a robot either so that he is a different race than me. So this finally feedbacks to Goggins again which is, it’s all in within you, and you know it.  Which Goggins actually explained with the: You as a scientists have to analyze the brain in every possible situation so that you can learn from it, but me as Goggins I know way more because I’m in the doing.   Therefore, Goggins knew tons of (and many more that weren’t share in this conversation) psychological aspects that scientist would take centuries.  I’m not implying wether science needs Goggins or viceversa, so don’t dig into that idea while reading this.   Point is, bro is actually him. Because he acknowledges his both sides like Carl Jung suggested, stare at that mutherfucker that don’t wanna run, and conquers.  There are many aspects in the Bible that explains a lot of the psychological senses that Goggins posses, also is interesting that he mentions a superior being, once again I’m not implying anything by this, just a mere observation that with the properly approach we can keep learning from the living proof.",1년 전,0,

@ERROR4o4842,"Today I discovered something, tell me if I am right- Instant motivation is a myth, unless it is related to a serious pain like death of a close one or a break up and so on,  But except for that all this charge up motivation does is give you temporary artificial confidence, that never lasts longer than a few days or months, but what lasts long is the guilt that comes after it, instant motivation makes you believe that you are not that guy who is just lying around doing nothing, but you are this guy who is fully motivated all the time, and the moment the motivation starts fading, you start feeling insecure  Unlike that, I propose another meathod, the 1 % rule - start getting 1% better everyday, now you might ask how do I measure the 1% , it is the amount you can change without letting the brain know that it's pleasure is being parted with, and after some days start challenging the brain little more, and like that but don't just to 50% or 100% , cuz that's just instant motivation which will not develop discipline in you but give you temporary sense of success without achieving anything",1년 전(수정됨),0,

He should then be aiming  for something higher than happiness like self knowledge or self actualisation or something. Otherwise it sounds like the pain is just an end in itself.  Also he seems to be saying, ""just do the opposite of whatever makes you happy"". This would mean that a teetotaller who hates alcohol should start drinking heavily because that ""sucks"" and is painful to do for him.   So there is fundamentally something missing here and I think it is the fact that he is not clear about the goal or the reason why he is doing it. At best he seems to be saying it was a reaction to how much he hated himself or the way he was, but at some point it needs to go beyond that. It has to become an obsession to find some kind of meaning to one's existence, to find some kind of ultimate truth or some ultimate freedom.",1년 전(수정됨),2,

Like David said, there is not one minute that I will not do it! I will never 'want' to do it.

@jameswayton2340,He re-parented himself. Something i hear from my therapist wich is what my goal is after trauma and emotional neglect as a child. its extremely difficult. It seems impossible. You called it a rebirth. But why did you say its motherhood and not fatherhood? Or parenthood?,1년 전,3,
@georginadoll6372,"@jameswayton2340 it's the words he uses about mental and physical pain. The absolute distress on the body and the mental anguish of realising that having carried a child inside and then gone through birth, that wasn't the start. It's then a HUGE project. A HUGE job of bringing up a child or children that are constant work for years and mother's carry that. It's like he says... I can't explain it. Then the continual small things, the monotony, the why did I do this? Why am I doing this? Who am I? Where am I? All the jeffin time. Always there. Not like some dad who switches off when he goes fishing or golfing. The only thing Goggins says that's not like a true mother is when he says about providing an needing time to do what he has to do. A mother doesn't do that because she carried the child or children. The only time I know of a mother doing that is the one that got killed going up a mountain. That's how God treats women who live their kids to go off and do what they want. For men, it's different but the hardwork and pain he talks about that he says he can't explain. That's a mother that does that shit. Dads  haven't  physically carried the child so it's going to always be different.",1년 전,3,

One thing about Goggins that comes through for me, however is,  and I'm willing to take odds on this, he's still got some pretty significant unhealed trauma driving that train. The one giveaway is the seeming lack of real joy. Going forward, where might he find it? My experience suggests he's going to heal and ironically find that joy . . . working as a paramedic. He's not diving deep into that study by accident.  If I cared enough (and I may at some point) I would also take the hard deep dive into Huberman's research sources. I suspect there are elements of those studies that don't really show the full complexity of what's being investigated. Another bet I'm willing to take odds on.",1년 전,0,

@angelinokon,"Dear 300 lb friend, People don't always get it, I understand. Things I wish a friend told me: 1. It can be hard to do basic things when you have a raging auto-immune thing and inflamation. Hire home health care workers to come to your house to clean, cook and shop for things to keep you happy and healthy. Have Huberman pay for it (smirk) or get it free from IHSS. 2. Bleach bath twice a week to cut the itch and the smell. Regular bleach only. Research how to dilute it in the water. 3. Indulge in a simple paper notebook and pens you love. Create a dopamine checklist of all the things you want to do to feel happy and healthy today (e.g Brush teeth, floss, nap, drink water, stare at the sky, walk around a book store, eat, etc). Check it off when you complete something. Don't worry about getting everything done. Recreate the list the next day. 4. Find a therapist to discuss why it feels safe not to fight. What in your past made it seem like it was safer to hide, be invisible. Write about it in your journal. You can get a therapist online in minutes.  5. Write in your journal a list of all the food you want to eat and liquids. The game is to eliminate processed foods and refined sugar. Enjoy what you eat. 6. Cut out one or all activities that feed dopamine addiction. Get obsesssed with your happy healthy checklist instead. Keep finding fun things to do that don't involve a screen (no gaming, p_rn, streaming video, or social media.) Limit screen time to 1 hour a day for healthy things only. 7. Seek doctors advice on medicine. Bimzelx (bimekizumab) was just FDA approved in October 2023. It's a wonder drug for psoraisis. Semaglutide can reduce food noise beause obesity is a disease. Belly and thigh are better than arm injection sites. Enjoy a dental cleaning to reduce brain fog and keep record of your own daily maintenance in your journal.  Try this for 7 days and continue if you feel amazing.  I love you friend. You can feel better.",1년 전,1,

@renntees,"if there's one thing I appreciate Goggins for is his ability to both accept his limitations and stubbornly learn ways to go around them to achieve his goals. this takes a lot of humility, more than discipline. we are so inclined to automatically let the ego take the wheel when things get uncomfortable and dedicate our time running from feeling uncomfortable. the ego hates being humble and truthful with the situation at hand and is constantly coming up with narratives that confirm why we can't or shouldn't achieve a thing we really want or need. it is comforting the conclusion Goggins' life draws: it doesn't matter who you are or what you have, you can always find ways to achieve it by taking the time and humility to know yourself and then work every day towards achieving your goals. I don't 100% agree with his ways and I don't have to because it's his life and his own ways, but I appreciate him. he is refreshing and real.",1년 전,3,

@StoicLoneWolf380,"I will never, ever get tired of listening to Goggins teach. I don't listen to him for discipline or for motivation. I listen to him for one quality - growth. What direction can I take? I've found my internal resources for my discipline. I don't even believe in motivation. I cringe at that word. I found what builds my confidence - doing shit that I don't like! Self-discipline is EVERYTHING! It sucks...yes, it. fucking. SUCKS! I'm 36, starting my career this year and it took me awhile through therapy to accept that I just started my marathon late BUT I started. I fucked off in my 20s and in my early 30s, I was complacent without a pinch of discipline. I relate to Goggins because what pushes him is what pushes me - all of the rejection from women, all of the internal doubt, my low self-esteem, my weaknesses, and what I failed at - I'm coming!  Listen, the science behind what Dr. Huberman discusses is amazing and it feels EXTREMELY good. I LI-TER-ALLY smile at uncomfortable shit because that is growth for me! I win or I learn. I don't lose. I run 4 times a week after work, at night, alone, in the cold, by myself. When people (including my own family) say ""it's dark"" or ""its cold"" or ""be careful"", I can't explain it but something in me brain clicks on. I smile, get my running shit, drive to my running destination, stretch, and run. I don't do excuses. I do NOT like to do any workout, period. It's a feeling. That's it - a feeling of I don't want to. I do it anyway because it's growth. I have learned to only do ""me"" vs me. I truly, truly don't give a fuck about society. It's a transformation. As you become more focused and digging into that dark place in your mind, you don't want to do shit with anyone. You become a bit off but being off IS you! It's truth because i ALWAYS, ALWAYS find me in the suck. ALWAYS!!!! Now I need to grow more by doing more shit I don't like which is calisthenics.   In the end, I want to be great and I'm nowhere near close to greatness. I don't want to be 70 years old knowing I didn't tap into my potential. Fuck. That! Just do it.

In a weird way I therefore find happiness in the redundancy and pointlessness of effort and pain. But I will never to the same extent as Goggins.  ADHD fucking sucks. Makes life so much harder than people think.  To me, happiness has always been my main incentive. So its ironic that I am now becoming more unhappy for feeling useless and worthless. Meaning that being unhappy for contributing to being great at even a redundant purpose, makes me less unhappy than I would have been. Maybe even happy.  I found that grinding a videogame and getting a drop in the ocean closer to ""great"" every day gave me purpose while remaining at a level of frictionless happiness I enjoyed. But I still have no success. I hate friction. But I hate not being successful.  Maybe something purposeful in real life will be something I can do without being unhappy one day. But I have yet to find that. Cause to be great at it I need to hate my life.",1년 전(수정됨),1,

@avivzelniker2937,"I’m only 20min in and Goggins is speaking big facts about ADHD. I had an opposite scenario where from age 8, I was diagnosed with ADHD, found to have a high IQ, and placed in accelerated courses. Circumstantially, my parents got a divorce and then I’m living between homes. Not very ideal for focus. Mom got stage 3 breast cancer. Yeah no bueno.   So once middle school hit (12-14yrs old), my grades were slowly but surely falling and I was taking increasingly higher does of medication (soon 60mg vyvanse). Right before highschool I chose to kick it myself because it severely messed with my mood and appetite. What was once a very happy, motivated, social and hungry, child turned into an underweight teen, in not ideal family situation, battling with the regular challenges of American public high school.   My grades plummeted by sophomore year of highschool. I hit rock bottom. I was getting on average 2-4hrs of sleep, unclean room, bad hygiene. Had a meeting with my highschool counselor, the dean, and both my divorced parents who never stood in the same room unless it was court/ for the kids. That meeting changed my life. I decided from that moment on to make life incredibly difficult for myself.  I never continued my medication regularly. After graduating highschool, I got into a 5th choice university, and took out hefty private loans. Not to mention, my parents each co-signed every other loan. If for whatever reason I didn’t make money out of university, I’m taking my parents down with me. I vowed to never take the ADHD meds unless I can get straight As or damn near em. First semester I was killing it: 4As and a B, I was sleeping at least 6-7hrs, making it to all my classes, excellent hygiene. Since then, I began taking medicine ‘as needed,’ but I still prefer to live my life without it.  As Goggins said, we [those with intense cases of ADHD] have to teach ourselves to focus. I never wanted to be reliant on the medication again. And I won’t. I have the tools now because I fought through the turmoil of living without them. I set my goals, took failure head on, and rose above.  Fast-forward to junior year of university, I transferred to a better university (one that I was rejected to previously), got scholarships for my grades I never would’ve received in highschool, and kept medication usage to only when studying for big exams. To be honest, I didn’t want to go to university at a point. I loved learning, but I hated learning what people thought was best for a boring run-of-the-mill career. But I enrolled and gave it 110%, just to be good at something I despised for the 8yrs preceding it. And I did succeed. Last 3 semesters before graduating I finished with straight As. To succeed at something you don’t like is a powerful skill. The uncomfortable. The doing, for the sake of doing.  Now I’m living in Israel with my family (please don’t get political in the comments) and before that I lived in Spain. I’m living my dream. All the money I make, I save or use to pay off my thousands of dollars in loans. The pain and the failures were the best things to ever happen to me. And I still face these struggles. I still face my rock bottom self. Just like Goggins and Huberman discuss it, these things haunt you. Excited for the beast I will become as this is just the beginning.  TLDR F*^% adhd meds, they’re giving crack to little kids mane. 60mg vyvanse at 12 years old wtf was my psychiatrist thinking. I seriously believe I would’ve been 3in taller if I wasn’t MALNOURISHED from a LACK OF APETITE.  Anyway. Thanks for reading my life story. (I’m 24 now) Good luck my fellow ADHD-havers. I’m good, but not great. The best catalyst for success comes from within. Find the things you want in life and push with all you got to make it happen. You are capable of so much and the only one who sets those limits are yourself.  Now someone please tell me… WHOS GOING TO CARRY THE BOAT?!!?!",1년 전(수정됨),1,

It’s kind of an addiction I mean even if I’m walking if I’m with someone that’s slower so I’ll just stop and I can’t get started again so it’s totally like you, I’ve learned and this is funny because Dr. Huberman talked about the whole dopamine reset I guess we do it naturally when we sleep but every moment of my day is feeding my addiction so I don’t stop or fall and I also notice if I stop or fall, cause I’m sick for example there’s no light.

@asadsayed1987,"Just pure love for David Goggins!  Was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitits back in 2020, unable to walk, sleep, etc. I still remember how painful and annoying it was and hearing that this condition is lifelong and chronic, i was completely broken. The only way to keep it in control was through being active throughout the day. So one day, after all that sorrow and sadness and feeling useless, i decided to do something about it.  started with small movements that hurt like hell and became consistent with it and went on 2 years like this.   2022, i discovered calisthenics and that was one of the best things that happened to me and to add more to that, I came to know about Goggins as well. I really felt his words. Read the book CANT HURT ME and that was literally the best thing i ever did.   Now i can run, jump and i do intermediate/advanced level calisthenics along with yoga and i have never felt any better in my life. My disease is chronic and life-long but the limitations are all in the mind. Be consistent, suffer for greatness and rejoice the pain💯❤🤜🤛",1년 전,62,

@aleps.l,"Me gustaria compartirle a todos los espectadores hispano parlantes las diferentes notas que tome al rededor de este podcast, que del cual siento que vale la pena escucharlo mas de una vez para clarificar unos puntos o memorizar otros tantos. Sin mas dilatación, acá las diferentes notas tomadas...  Todo el dialogo de David Goggins se aferra a sus experiencias personales, enfocandose demasiado en ello, en la experiencia y como es importante experimentar diferentes momentos en la vida, momentos dificiles en su mayoria y como reaccionaremos a ellos, y atravesaremos por ello.  Es importante por eso, experimentar la vida con todos sus matices, dandonos cuenta, segun Goggins, que en su mayoria son grises, lo cual me recuerda demasiado a Buda, la vida es miseria y sufrimiento ¿que vas hacer al respecto? seguir viviendo.   Huberman en la entrevista trajo unos estudios bastante curiosos al respecto de una zona en el cerebro la cual crece cuando se hacen cosas dificiles con constancia y tambien disminuye, cuando dejas de hacer esas cosas dificiles. Se puede decir, que la cosa mas dificil con la que estoy luchando ahora, es el despertarme temprano y deberia de hacerlo, para aprovechar aun mas mi jodido dia. Toda esta voluntad de querer hacer cosas dificiles, es algo que se va construyendo HACIENDOLO.  Es por eso que deberiamos, ir en contra de nosotros mismos, porque pues, al final del dia estamos compitiendo con nuestro yo de ayer y con el que queremos ser en un mañana. SOY YO CONTRA YO, NO ME PUEDO DEFRAUDAR.   Es curioso como Goggins coloca este caso imaginario donde nos tenemos que imaginar como una persona en cuidados paliativos recordando nuestras vidas, haciendo un pequeño repaso sobre todo lo que hicimos, es obvio que nos vamos a encontrar con grandes fracciones de tiempo perdido dentro de una institucion academica o dentro de un cubiculo oficinista, pero lo que se hace fuera de ello, es lo que realmente le da valor a tu vida, el como enfrentaste el dia a dia, las decisiones que tomaste y los momentos que en dificultad, disfrutaste, porque sabes que dentro de las masivas cantidades de mierda que comistas a traves de tu vida, encontraste algo de valor en ello y lo pusisite a prueba.  Algo que tambien me parecio increiblemente curisoso sobre la entrevista es acerca como Goggins examina la industria de la motivacion, que al parecer es increiblemente rentable. El dice como estos voceros son en su mayoria blasfemos, no existe una cura para la falta de voluntad ni para la falta de motivacion, por eso existe gente que aun paga miles de dolares, euros o pesos en cursos motivacionales para ver si al final pueden levantar su culo y empezar a hacer cosas que realmente represente un premio. Pero la autoayuda o la motivacion no se consigue de en otro lado, SE CONSIGUE DENTRO DE UNO MISMO, HACIENDOLO.  Goggins tiene esta forma de pensar en la que se fuerza a hacer las cosas el solo, en el que se visualiza como uno de los hijos de puta mas cabrones y recibe la motivacion de hacerlas al tener en cuenta todo el proceso por el que ha pasado. Es un proceso de auto reflejo, en el que ve las cosas malas de el mismo y se las explica a la gente sin aminalar la respuesta para que suene un poco mas agradable, LA CRUDA Y ETERNA VERDAD, sin filtros. Goggins es un cabron fuerte y quiero construir la mentalidad que el tiene para hacer las cosas.  EL CEREBRO ES LA HERRAMIENTA MAS PODEROSA DEL MUNDO.  No se puede ser un teorico, necesitas ser un maldito practicante.  Huberman trata de explicar desde sus conocimientos de psicologia (los cuales son pocos ya que el hombre es neurocientifico) y le narra a Goggins como en su cabeza tiene tres voces internas, una que le hace ver la realidad de las cosas, lo que realmente sucede, lo cual para muchos puede llegar a ser terriblemente abrumador, pero tambien hay una voz que recoge eso, lo analiza y lo asimila para que despues haya una contra respuesta hacia esa auto critica infligida por una de las voces internas. Es por eso que nos podemos enseñar a mirar mas hacia adentro, a encontrarnos con nuestro yo mas fragil, enfrentarlo, sacudirlo hasta los cimientos para despues reconstruirlo. Pero recuerda que es un proceso largo, que como diria Goggins ""te demorarias una vida en entender"" pero que puedes empezar hacer en cada momento.  Enseñate a perder, fallar es un arte en el cual se crea la maestria hacia la victoria.  Para finalizar con este podcast, Goggins termina con un discurso que me mantuvo embelesado, en el cual nos invita a pelear con nuestros ""demonios"" internos, enfrentarlos y encontrar una solucion apropiada a lo que sea que ocurre en nuestra cabeza para asi sacar resoluciones de ello, experiencias que es lo que al final se basa nuestra existencia en este plano material, experiencias, en su mayoria dificiles pero que al fin y al cabo, contribuyen en nosotros.

@kjpajor7337,"I’ve never commented on a HubermanLab podcast. There is maybe 20 or less episodes that I haven’t listened to of this podcast. This was one of my least favourite personally and let me explain. I think David was a great guest to have and having read his book and seen him various times before, it was good for motivation. However, I think it got away from what the HubermanLab podcast is all about. Andrew tried to touch on science and science related tools such as the Anterior Mid-Cingulate Cortex and other neurological areas but I wish these areas were increased in this podcasts. Perhaps not as much as the early episodes where we really got to learn about functions of the brain and neurology at a med student level but learning about these brain processes is what I think makes Andrew’s talent and understanding to covey these topics special about this podcast. Love the podcast but let’s get back to more science related tools and less about a personal journey similar to many other podcasts across the network these days. It might harder from a marketing perspective to have specialists who are less known compared to big names online (Goggins, Zuc, etc) but having these specialists who voices are not usually heard on podcasts or online is what makes this podcasts so unique and successful.

With the cold showers, Carnivore diet, and my love of neuroscience thanks to you, I'm always very eager to try and help others out that are struggling and where I was two years ago with my life.  It wasn't until I started watching you, Goggins, and a few others, that I realized like David says, that I need to go to war with myself on a daily and oftentimes hourly basis to fight off the guy I used to be. You all have helped me to understand what I needed to do,  and as a result, turn my life around for the better.  Thank you.",1년 전,1,
@jfelix5244,"Well done, gentlemen! When Dr. Huberman shared the research on the workings of the anterior mid-cingulate cortex (00:46:09), David's face and demeanor softened. Science backs up what he's been modeling in words and action for decades. His message has been largely misunderstood. He was called crazy. ""Well, guess what, mother*****s?"" With smiles and head nods (1:03:22), one could tell Mr. Goggins appreciated the science which validated decades of suffering and hard work. That said, the external confirmation pales in comparison to the True Knowledge that comes from putting the sword into the fire and hammering it over and over day after day. Goggins has been conducting his own experiments and doing his own research for years as a practitioner. When I give talks on neuroscience, I'm going to rename the anterior mid-cingulate cortex, the David Goggins axis in his honor. :)",1년 전,1,

I am an active Huber-head so I am finally hearing Goggins now and I’m floored by how deeply I understand him on a personal level. I didn’t join the Marine Corps for money, for college, or to bc it was a family tradition or bc I wanted to serve my country. I joined the Marine Corps to see the depths and heights of what I was capable of physically and mentally. My whole life I was a lazy, self-sabotaging POS and my parents never instilled any discipline in me whatsoever so I knew I needed to create it myself through pure misery. It was in the SUCK where I finally felt like myself and the anxiety of wondering who the fuck I am was finally silenced. And it’s because of that experience today that I can harness the power inside of me better than anyone I know. People who meet me or know me have always told me there is something special about me and I feel it too but it’s not bc of my physical beauty or my sense of humor… it’s the fucking monster inside me that forces me to face my fears and seek challenge because I refuse to wake up on my death bed wondering what I could’ve been.

@PeTer-e1q,"Dear Professor Huberman, first things first: your podcast is amazing, I have learned a ton and it has become my go-to format for listening.  There is one thing, though that I am often missing, and that is effect size. For me personally (and I hope for many people out there as well) knowing how much something influences something would be a very valuable piece of information for many of the topics you touch.  One (out of many possible) example: I talked to my 20-year-old little brother recently. He is very much into working out, but also partying and all-nighters at college. Wanting to shine with my newly acquired knowledge I told him about some of the mechanisms and empirical findings you shared with all of us on the importance of good sleep on all kinds of physical and mental functions. I was stopped dead in my track when he simply asked: yeah, but HOW MUCH does it really matter? How much less quality sleep can I get away with (for my gains :)) if I want to keep partying? I couldn't really answer.  I realize that conveying effect sizes (and also statistical significance for that matter) can be difficult. Not least because these things are complicated to grasp, even for experts (coming from a quantitative field myself i know how much I sometimes stumble over at first innocent-looking concepts in statistics). Also, effect sizes might not get reported by all publications. Also, knowing an average of effect might not be enough information when wanting to apply some piece of empirical finding as a tool for myself because I don't know how flat the underlying distribution is. Also, assuming that all causes are (linearly) independent from one another when contributing to a certain outcome might not capture compounding effects.  All that being said, I feel there is immense value in knowing how strong an effect is.  Again, thank you so much for your work, educating all of us about science!  Peter",1년 전,0,

@surething3862,"While I may not know your brother on a level that you might be familiar with, it sounds like a lame, ill-conceived response to a rather serious point that you were trying to make.  Data points to the emphasis you should put on sleep conducive to muscle growth, as well as how much sleep contributes to how well you recover. This is no revelation, look at bodybuilders at the highest level.  You can have a fantastic physique without sleeping normally, of course, but it will always be far less than optimal  It all boils down to preference. If he wishes to never hit his genetic potential/limit in physicality, you can’t stop him.  - someone who’s trained HARD for some years now",1년 전,0,
@PeTer-e1q,"Hey, thanks for answering! I agree with you on the specific point (i.e. I'd still strongly suggest proper sleep to my brother and I am sure he'll come around ;-)). But I still think my general remark is valid (or so it seems to me....). Namely, that understanding effect size (""how much"" something is influenced by something) is an important piece of information when trying to properly understand empirical findings.  More elaboration:  I just listened to one of the very first Huberman Lab podcasts again (one about sleep and light for learning) and had 2 thoughts.  1) Professor Huberman himself said in that episode that he wants to cover BOTH, the science and the tools because the tools alone, without understanding the science do not enable you to adjust and filter and be flexible based on your life/circumstances/abilities. Exactly this point: essentially picking and choosing and adjusting the tools he talks about is necessary for (I think) most of us and would be made much easier (again, for me) if I knew more about effect sizes.   2) More specifically: in the mentioned episode he talks about the importance of bright light in the morning and less bright light in the afternoon/evening. This made me think about screen time for my two young kids. They both have their allowed amount of watching TV per day. This happens to usually take place in the evening, due to a variety of reasons (mornings are usually hectic and have to be more efficient; my 6-year-old would get up even earlier if he knew he got to watch TV first thing, etc....). BUT: maybe it would still make sense to not have them sit in front of the TV in the evening because this could improve their sleep (among other things). But in order to decide that I would have to know how strong the influence really is. In the absence of that knowledge, I know about myself that I will just leave it undecided which comes down to not changing the status quo (maybe just my personal mental bias...)  All this points me to the desire to have some quantitative information about effect sizes (to the extent that this is possible, again, I know this can be complicated).   Would like to hear your thoughts on this.  best  Peter @surething3862 ",1년 전(수정됨),1,

I was losing the internal dialogue to the weak version of myself. While I've never skipped a day in the atomic habits that I've set for myself (my minimal standard), I've been acting far from my best. The good thing is, that now I've finally learned how shitty it feels to be overstimulated. It feels lethargic, unmotivated, weak, annoying, frustrating and in general just negative.

@Ihavethebiggestnameinyoutube,"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  01:25 📚 David Goggins faced a tumultuous childhood and obesity in his 20s, leading to an inner dialogue that drove his transformation into a Navy SEAL, ultramarathon runner, and bestselling author. 03:19 🎙️ David Goggins discusses a form of intense inner dialogue and self-discipline he practices daily to maintain his self-discipline, influencing his achievements. 08:07 🧠 Goggins, despite struggles with learning disabilities like ADHD, adopts an arduous method of studying by writing and rewriting content repeatedly to memorize and comprehend complex medical material. 15:16 🏃 Goggins separates his focus in activities like running and studying, viewing them as different forms of suffering that demand singular attention and discipline. 19:58 🔥 For David Goggins, achieving greatness demands an unparalleled level of focus, passion, and commitment, translating into a daily struggle and total immersion in each endeavor. 20:25 🌱 David Goggins emphasizes that his actions and sharing his story aren't driven by fame or wealth but to inspire those who might relate to his journey and learn from it. 21:23 💡 Goggins reflects on how his challenging background and physical limitations were part of a deliberate experiment by a higher power, believing that friction and adversity are the true paths to growth. 23:48 📚 While he shares principles in his books, Goggins acknowledges that the extreme, obsessive dedication required for greatness can't fully be conveyed in writing; it must be experienced personally. 28:59 🧠 His transformation came from internalizing the haunting reality of his existence, prompting him to navigate an intense and disciplined journey toward self-improvement without any external guidance or support. 37:59 ⚖️ Goggins' philosophy revolves around relentless discipline and effort, asserting that success is not about motivation or passion but consistent, arduous action—a perspective contrary to common inspirational rhetoric. 42:11 🛠️ Discipline is built by repeatedly reviewing and improving upon one's work and actions, especially during challenging moments. 43:38 🧠 Building mental toughness involves adopting the qualities and characteristics of admired individuals, incorporating them into one's identity through discipline and commitment. 45:34 🚧 The path to greatness entails hard work that may not look glamorous or motivating, akin to being stuck in a dungeon with the key to success but hesitating to use it. 46:31 🧭 The anterior mid-cingulate cortex, associated with willpower, grows when individuals persist in doing things they dislike or find challenging, defining the will to live and overcoming adversity. 52:46 🗝️ There's no shortcut or hack to building willpower; the true 'hack' is continuously facing and overcoming difficult challenges, which becomes a way of life and shapes one's identity. 01:03:23 🧠 The anterior mid-cingulate cortex plays a pivotal role in activating movement even when one doesn't want to move, closely related to dopamine and the perception of pain. 01:04:47 🔄 The anterior mid-cingulate cortex has neuroplasticity, capable of growth and shrinkage, emphasizing the need for continuous effort and upkeep. 01:06:10 🤯 David Goggins stresses the difficulty in articulating the immense inner strength he's cultivated, acknowledging the struggle others have in understanding the sacrifices behind his success. 01:07:29 💡 Goggins highlights the common pursuit of comfort and averageness, expressing frustration at the unwillingness of many to endure the challenging path to greatness. 01:14:56 🔥 Goggins emphasizes the internal drive required for change, stating that no external motivation or advice can substitute for one's personal determination to transform their life. 01:23:28 🌟 Goggins acknowledges the importance of sleep, nutrition, and recovery but emphasizes that to achieve his goals and build confidence, he had to forego some of these essential aspects of self-care. 01:25:52 💪 Goggins explains how he had to overcome various challenges, including insecurity, stuttering, and lack of confidence, by sacrificing many things to gain the confidence necessary for his personal growth. 01:29:11 🏡 Goggins prioritizes his family's needs but maintains an unbalanced approach to ensure he has the time and focus required for his personal growth and pursuits. 01:31:58 💬 He emphasizes the importance of being upfront and honest about one's true self in relationships, refusing to compromise who he is to please others, ensuring clear communication and setting expectations. 01:37:41 🔥 Goggins emphasizes the power of being honest and vulnerable with oneself, using personal truths as the starting point for growth and self-assurance, encouraging others to embrace their truths and face challenges head-on. [01:41:58 URL] 🧠 The real motivation for David Goggins comes from the unseen work he's done in the darkness of his life, not from external validation or recognition. [01:44:23 URL] 💊 Goggins emphasizes that the real ""medicine cabinet"" for strength and motivation is internal, within oneself, and not reliant on external substances or stimulants. [01:46:45 URL] 🏃 Goggins' approach is less about external success and more about maintaining friction, consistently taking action, and nurturing the mind rather than focusing on external supplements or shortcuts. [01:50:32 URL] 🧭 Building mental strength involves a rigorous internal dialogue, feeding the mind with the right mental nutrients, and becoming unstoppable through continuous practice and perseverance. [01:59:57 URL] 🌟 Goggins limits his public engagement to protect his own growth, understanding the frustration of being misunderstood while highlighting the importance of personal evolution and perseverance against self-doubt and external criticism. 02:03:18 🔥 Smokejumping involves parachuting near fires that are inaccessible by regular means, risking health and finances. 02:04:10 💪 Developing immense willpower is crucial, as it's a perishable skill; continuous challenging tasks maintain and strengthen it. 02:05:08 👀 The liberating feeling of honesty and authenticity is achieved when you speak the truth based on personal earned experiences. 02:10:21 🎨 Daily introspection and mental creativity are vital for personal growth; blocking distractions helps in shaping the ideal self-image. 02:20:02 🎯 Learning how to fail properly is crucial for eventual success; embracing failure prepares one for the challenging journey toward victory. 02:23:51 🧠 Listen to your own journey, not just others' opinions. Understanding yourself is key to success. 02:25:17 🧠 The unconscious mind controls much of our actions. Introspection and understanding its influence are crucial. 02:27:42 🧠 Self-understanding is rare; many avoid introspection. Going inward helps understand and navigate life's challenges. 02:28:10 🧠 Confronting inner demons is essential for growth. Daily introspection cleanses the ""dark cupboards"" of the mind. 02:31:27 🧠 Facing past trauma requires deep, uncomfortable introspection. Avoiding or dismissing it stunts personal growth.

You cant avoid doing what needs to be done unless you are ready to be old with crippling regret, at which point you CAN'T do what was meant to be done anymore.

Do what makes you uncomfortable (you have to be honest with yourself so that you can do what your mind is telling you to avoid). I take away that to be true to yourself you have to seek your own discomfort and do what scares you. Do it with fear but you have to do it so that one day you become what you were created to be! You can do this! You have to live your life with all of you inside free. This is your life. You have to live it to the fullest. You got this! One day, you will look back and see that every fear you faced was all worth it. You have to do this for yourself because there will never be a better decision than loving yourself. Love yourself first and that will transform everyone around you to be their best self. This is it. You got what you have been waiting for. Now it's the time to be intentional about seeking discomfort and letting you true self free and go wild!! A better day is coming as one of my favorite songs says! Let's be intentional about making the world a better place. Let's make a difference! Go wild my true self. There is nothing for you to lose but what you will gain will be beyond words.

I really love David Goggins and the messages he shares and I am glad to find you now too!   Anterior Midcingulate Cortex is also so interesting to me now, now that I know it exists. I think during the self reflection portion Andrew you mention that people don’t die from emotions, i had to ponder on that also and I think of people who may have.   (hypothetical situation but have heard of similar situations). Say someone passes a week or so after their spouse passes, that makes me think Grief had a part to play in that. Also with Anger extreme emotions over time, may cause death in the individual who does not process it I guess. But those are extreme cases.

It sucks, but we find ourselves in the suck, building confidence to the point that we can look someone in the eye with no fear and hesitation and state our truth instead of being insecure and people pleasing. We know we can do it but laziness and comfort in our routines holds us back, its also scary finding out who we are and who we are not, so we keep those cupboards closed and what we really need to do is open them and clean them everyday. Results take a long time but if we quit in the middle, we go downhill and cancel all the progress we've made so far.  Deeply profound messages you shared!",1년 전,1,

@erlank,"Very self confronting. A true human being. We leave a lot on the table. True potential is absolute commitment. The lion and the antelope and nature is 'always on', just like Goggins. There is no off day or gratification. The off day, in nature, is when you get eaten. Humans once lived 'always on' that's how we managed to perpetuate. Externalising our survival and justification through social constructs to protect us from the ravages and impartiality of nature, we have drifted from our true potential. It is almost impossible to be 'always on' in modern society. Yet it can still be done. Still, all paths are not the same. Not everyone needs to be a navy seal or ultramarathoner to become their ultimate self. Leonardo Da Vinci, Mozart, Mother Teresa, Picasso, Charles Bukowski, Octavia Butler, Alan Watts, Mohamed Ali, et al., obsessively followd their deepest passions, to achieve their fulfillment. It is difficult to compare 'greatness' across time and individuals. Every human is more unique than we can possibly imagine. Every life can be inspirational, when we focus individually on 'self realisation' and practice collaborative competition instead of dominant ego serving competition. That's what I love about David Goggins, he only wants to conquer himself and be the best he can be for his souls sake, not to dominate others, but to collaborate through his example with us, as to how we can all reach for what yearns to express in us, through our own unique journey.

@nottyseel949,"Yeah, I learned a long time ago that I was just looking for something to make it easier.  And that's why ""it"" was always my weakness and I stopped looking.  Still a bit weak, but the point is I stopped pretending that there was a trick to it.  The entire point is to suffer through it, and 100%, most of the time, I simply am not willing to pay the cost.  But I refuse to gaslight myself that I can haggle down the price anymore and that has benefit me greatly.  The only thing that actually helped was perspective.  Realizing that envy is not really a motivator.  It's easy to want someone else's results because you have no notion of your life after paying the cost so it seems like they got it for free, even if you watch some cute montage of how hard they supposedly worked.  It doesn't sink in and seems like ""it must be nice.""   A lot of our motivations are recognition, which I think for most people are really vanity.  Real things like health, addiction, relationships, productivity are not usually as glamourous as the things we think we want to achieve because someone else got a lot of credit for them.  Realizing the things that actually matter to me did make it, I won't say easier, but made it necessary to walk over the spikes to get them.  That I think is the most important assessment that is probably easy for most people not to make because of too many comparisons with others.",1년 전,0,

Has this ever been studied on a date/time scale? For example if karma is a thing which it is, that’s basically energy you put out coming back cause that’s how I see energy. You get what you put out. But how long does it take to get and emotional energy you put out to get it back in time?

I wanted to share a warm thought; If you think of your partner on one side cheering you on, or also maybe not understanding your work ethic; That image is also, maybe mostly, the result of the work you put into that relationship. It is an exchange of ideas, effort and energy with a net positive result for yourselves and your surrounding community. She cheers you on because she can, the relationship allows for it and tou have worked for that, that is a victory in its own, it is not random. I’m sure you have deeply loved someone, if not then Costello:) You can imagine where that can take you when it works out, when you both put in the work towards a relationship.

@shawnb2bfitness,"I always like listening to Goggins interviews because his mindset is so unlike the status quo.  I was pumped to know that Dr. Huberman was having him on.  On one hand, I hope that he's able to get to a place where, even as he uses the negative events of his past as fuel, he is able to identify less with that past and more so with who he has become.  ON THE OTHER HAND, I love his 'no excuses', 'no nonsense' mindset.  He helps us all to see that we really don't have excuses either, and that we need to start being honest with ourselves so that we can extract the greatness that resides inside of all of us.  The way that he lives his life almost makes him like a sort of guinea pig for us to see what humans are capable of.  We're so comfortable in our society!  The thought about exploring oneself so deeply is indeed frightening.  As a personal trainer, I can't imagine doing some of the physical feats that he's done - and continues to do - but I am pushed to expand my thinking.",1년 전,0,

@V12509,"Long post about some change that occurred in my life, if you don’t feel like reading you can skip.   David describes my life as someone with ADHD. I was always like this, suffering from insecurity, I gradually started fixing my mentality, what helped was seeing my progress and seeing how I got better than the people around me. I think the last straw was when 2 relatives from the medical profession told me while we were discussing stuff: “You’re actually good”. That was it, that was the final moment of my insecurities, all of the hard work on improving myself, positive visualization, doing work, eliminating distractions (I was using the methods Huberman advices before I even know he existed)… I got self sustained, then that affirmation from 2 veterans in the field, it snapped.  Now I’ve got a mentality similar to Goggins and Tate (controversial, don’t agree with many stuff he says, but the mental aspect of him I like it). I’m of course not on their level of mental toughness, but I’m way better than 4 years ago, and 4 years ago I was way better than 8 years ago. Progress is all that matters, I am my own competitor, as long as I’m overcoming myself, I’m satisfied.   1 semester away from being a doctor In my 2nd year when the p1andemic hit, I got the toughest period in my life, everybody told me to quit, everybody blamed me why I can’t pass while others can, everybody told me to compromise and take an easier route. I was alone, no one in my family stood but against me even though I know they love me and want the best for me but that’s parenting for you. It was very cold and looked timeless, it was like a prison without bars, where were all of the so called friends? They disappeared. It was only me in there against everything and everyone. I went from hating my life back then, to going on a roll, not only in university, but I started eating healthy, cooking, then I learnt a martial art, now I’ve got a lean physique.   I look back now with a smile, I don’t hate my life, I actually love that kid in the past, I understand him, and I appreciate how stubborn he was to rise up from the ashes like a phoenix.  I completely understand and empathize with David. I never knew this was his story. My respect to him is through the roof right now.   Hope everybody else makes it, if you work for it, you earn it, against all odds.",1년 전,0,

And i dont know if David is just a less optimistic person, or if this negative grind of his is a conscious play as to be part of his brand and appeal.   And its the same with getting in shape. Im no olympic lifter, but i went from beer drinking beer belly, to pretty excellent lean muscle mass. Again, there was some sacrific and hard work, but the process was mainly playful, explorative and joyful.  Not knocking him. His message has clearly helped thousands of people.

And as he was the one that put himself through all this, what should he be afraid of anything?

@generaldwane1462,"34:15 There is nothing but to do doing the thing there is no passion, no joy, no motivation, it's ugly it's every day of life just doing no discipline (all of these are watered words) yoj just have to do it's the doing without expecting results all those words are Bullshit doesn't mean anything. It's what you want your life to be and work towards it.  37:20 it's all stick you work everyday without expecting results but, you expect to live the life and do things in life more than the results. obviously in the go you achieve some goals but, it's not the target the goal is to live and do things everyday the only carrot is maybe you get reach the goal but, the real life is you do thing everyday doing it the next day, doing it again + gain +tommorow again +do it again +....... +n(infinity). Until you die do not attach greed (लोभ) with कर्म. Delay that carrot delay the gratification the only thing is कर्म doing. How do I want to live, want to be remembered and what legacy I want to leave behind. Its all what I can become to be remembered what i can do for the people and how much i can do.  1:10:00 It's a new life you have to want it people like to think about past when they were capable of something and were successful but, now they are not. ergo capable they like to feed of that past and not do anything always saying I was that and taking pride in that Licking that candy from the past and justifying avoiding today's hardship by saying I did it I did that and you should have seen me then. 1:17:55 there is no get out of jail free Card because I know what to do I know exactly what to do then why I'm not doing it I don't need David goggins, huberman to tell me I'm not gonna go by exact protocol of David goggins the haunting part of life is I know I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna start doing it, it's going to happen, it has to happen I don't have the luxury of money, I'm alone I have to do it. It will happen. I can't afford that I got to start now, and when I get done with that session, I got to start again, and again, repetition is key, callousing the mind, soon you'll notice that mind is start to getting hard.  1:40:00 it's alone the grind the life in the dungeon it's all alone like a warrior. 2:23:00 i know what i know everyone else can go fuck themselves I've had the conversation inside myself and I understand myself and everyone else who's trying to tell me something can go fuck themselves",1년 전(수정됨),1,

@mayagami1,"Hey Andrew!  First of all, thank you so much for the work you do with these podcasts. I enjoy them so much, and I enjoy a lot the variety of topics, the sense of details you put in it and they way it is very easy to understand and to get the points, even for my as a guy from Austria and not native-speaker of English…   I am a musician and therapist and dedicate my life in observing, discovering, unveiling and diving into myself.   This means in an emotional way: getting to know my emotions, give them their place and space and time, crumbling down walls, release old trauma, learning to love the parts of myself that are very resisting to change etc.   This means in a spiritual way: getting to know my heart space, learning to forgive myself and others, expand my heart space to hold a lot of things this life just brings by living it (with in my case having four children haha), offering spaces for people to come together for praying, singing, exploring inside and connection to something bigger than this human life. Etc...  This means in physical way to have a routine that strengthens my body and focus, healthy eating etc etc, all the well known things…  So, in many of these things your podcasts helped me, sometimes a lot, sometimes in a little details, all together in a great way. Thanks for that!  It feels important to me to reach out to you and tell that there is one thing, I am really missing in that:   It is to point out, that all this „self-optimizing“ practices include the danger of being very hard to yourself, of not learning to also be gentle, self-caring, self-loving with yourself. I am writing this after hearing this episode I comment, as it again points out to me, that this is in many things I hear from you, a missing hint. To me, all things things you talk about (or let other people talk about with you) make a lot less sense, if you not also focus on a healthy relationship to yourself in a soft way, not too much disciplined way, not self-(and of course other) judging way of living.   So please, don’t get me wrong, the benefits and good sides I enjoy listening to you and your guests are by far more influential and beneficial. But maybe considering a guest to talk about something off-scientific topic speaking about things I descried up in the text? Would love to heart that too in your style.  Again, thanks for your good work, blessings and greetings from Austria.  Andeo",1년 전,1,

@fightington,"The irony if this sort of grindset whatever approach is   no matter how hard you try - you will never reach even a m8nute fraction of the strength and power that comes from the Self that you are at your core - that you have always been and will be even after death itself you are in your essence the source of every strength you attempt to reach for - you are the source of the Big Bang itself - we all are that - always, already and before and after the the existence of the galaxies, the scape between the stars and all of the creative impossibility of earth and it's inhabitants including these ppl you think have all the answers  And the bigger joke is that the harder you try to get there the less you will discover this inherent power  It's like being in a park in paris on a warm summer night and puttimg your heart and sole into trying to get to that place in paris on a night like that   The trying is the problem and please dont inherit the same unconcious subtext of Goggin's whole schtick - that we are not already enough and actualky deficient anf we need to torture ourselves to prove to a part of ourselves that developed in a rough period where we were not mature enough to know any other way to survive  If you want strength - lift weights but along the way - discover the battle between all those forces inside you that have oscured the known sense that you are utterly content, free, alive and awake and are fullfilled in a way that words could never do justice  IFS is the fastest, the safest and the most dignified and respectful way to naturally return to the always already awake being thst you are   And from there you will care for and treat yourself with the attention and dignity that naturally arises for a human on a planet where life is touch and the struggle is real - but you can now handle it all  And your goggins related activities will be optimized, fueled and enhanced more than any motivational speech could ever do  You'll lift more , run more and feel better   Because you aren't containing half your energy in unresolved ptsd stuff and the rest on holding it all in and berating yourself for imperfection   perfection is impossible for the self but The Self laughs at the idea of ever aiming for something that You alredy are  IFS - Prof Richard Schwarz",1년 전,1,

@fourshore502,"for me, they key thing has been to exclude a lot of things, to sacrifice a lot of things, for other things. a lot of people dont want to do this understandably and think they have time to do everything (including me) but i think it is very necessary for growth to understand how painfully few hours of time youve got. take news for example. do you really need to know every single thing musk does every day for example?  or keep up to date with all the latest tech news or whatever? unless you are working in that industry no you do not. actually even if youre in that industry you probably dont. even working out. sure its good for the health but a lot of people in my opinion overdo it and they spend too much time in the gym and they do it for vanity reasons more than health. so i cut down my workout time to a few times per week, and i do it at home, i dont even go to the gym.  the second thing is to know yourself. if you go too hard for too long you will hit a brick wall and burn out. or destroy your knees, like he did with his running. is that really a good idea? so you have to work hard yes but work smart too. i dont believe the ""only stick"" approach works for everyone, and i actually dont believe that he is quite telling the truth about it either. he says things still suck but hes a multi millionaire and hes got a girlfriend or wife. thats not stick, thats carrot. if everything was all stick from cradle to grave why not just end it right here and now?   also and this is super important: DONT COMPARE YOURSELF TO OTHERS. we all have different difficulties different backgrounds different traumas different skills. some of the things i have overcome probably look idiotically simple to others. like opening certain software and beginning to learn it, or cleaning my apartment. but for me these were MASSIVE obstacles to overcome. think about that before you judge others too. for me going to the gym is like a reward, its the easiest thing in the world its like an escape from everything. but for others its almost impossible to doand they hate it.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

When you do things you dont want to do, and neither feel good about it when done? When it doesn't feel like an achievment, and there is still a lingering resentment afterwards for having done those and not being able to say 'no'.

@igorvolkov6396,"This episode helps to resolve eternal questions of philosophy and pure science. 1. Freedom of will. Can human do what he wants? Philosophers grind it for centuries. Frankly, that's simple. Of course he can, only within reasonable limits. Just set accessible goals. This sort of willpower faces mainly external obstacles. 2. This is more complicated. ""I don't want, but will do it."" How is it ever possible? I mean, everybody knows this from own experience, but how to arrange it on the level of neural circuits? The classical scheme is motivation -> action. You have a motor image in prefrontal cortex + desire, emotional activation from the limbic system (let it be cingulate gyrus). No desire - the image will disintegrate. No motivation - no action. I guess, a positive emotion still exists, but this is controversial. From cybernetical point, the brain is a multiparametrical regulator. You really pursue several goals simultaneously. Something is attractive, others - repulsive. Willpower is the ability to go on in such environment.",1년 전,0,

The inner self (soul) is a constant battle.  In order to win the everyday battle we must develop a counter active argument to the truth about what we really are (habitual and taught) in order to overcome our own enemies.

He even said there is no such thing as an inspirational story, there is no overcoming, no glory of discipline or will, because without free will EVERYTHING is and was determined long ago, so we are not responsible for any ill or good that we do. Sapolsky would say the triumphant story of David Goggins is not worth celebrating, since David Goggins was predetermined to do what he's done, so no credit can or should go to him for simply doing what we was predetermined to do. Does that sound right, or does that sound insane? I go with the latter.",1년 전,0,

@YyNRCyY," @vilma-sofiakumpulainen6374 there’s no peer review evidence that suggests pomadoro has any positive effects. Instead, just try and focus until u can’t. Once ur noticing u can’t stay locked in, take a break and come back in a certain amount of time. Also, medication shouldn’t be something u refuse or look down on. Adhd is a literal lack of proper workings in ur brain. Medication with proper studying and training can improve focus exponentially",1년 전(수정됨),0,

@Ella-kt1br,"When I listened to the podcast, I was thrilled and it really motivated me emotionally. But I was also ""worried"" about the motivation because I learned that it is only short-lived.  Motivated as I was, I then tried to somehow get closer to my goal of doing and achieving everything I wanted. I wrote a daily routine. That sounds so weak. By the way, I constantly think that everything I try to do is a very weak attempt to implement what Goggins says, but that's the way it is at the moment. When I finished after over an hour, my whole week was timed and I felt like I had robbed myself of my freedom. Really a very constricting feeling. All my enthusiasm from listening to the podcast was swept away.  I'm exhausted after this emotional evening and once again, as always after listening to David Goggins, I wonder how much I'm getting out of listening to him. Because he absolutely impresses me, but I always have the feeling, or the inkling, that I won't make it. And by that I mean that I can't even begin to make it and that all my attempts are really absolutely pathetic.  I guess I am normal people lol",1년 전,0,

@albobaby29,"Many men slave away to earn money, fame, women, etc i.e. ""conquer the world"".  Goggins and probably 5% of men have channeled their rage, passion, ""demons""...to conquer THEMSELVES.  That is the difference between the 5% and the 95%.  The question is WHAT was his motivation? WHAT flipped the switch for him to choose this path?  He's tried to explain it but it's impossible to explain unless you've experienced it.  I only did once with end stage cancer...refused medical tx of any kind.  Drank 100 ounces of carrot juice (try juicing that much with zero energy, I had to dig deep), did coffee enemas, took 8 grams of curcumin daily, and FORCED my low energy ass to walk the block several times daily.  That's all I did, but it was HARD.  I HAD to dig deep...or die.  (There are cureS, it was simple, but not EASY by any means).  David wasn't forced to, but still managed to, which I find intriguing.  Even now, years after recovery, perfectly healthy, doing low carb mostly carnivore, and some physical accomplishments like a black belt, I STILL have trouble digging deep to get my ass to the gym, exercise more, pursue goals, etc.  But I tap into that switch I experienced to save my life, and I'm usually amazed by what I can do.

@copernicansun744,"I wish someone would ask Goggins the hard questions.  Reading his first book he described in detail how his father was ambitious, how he would hob nob with famous people and prided himself as a power player in the greater Buffalo area.  He described how his father abused his mother, his siblings, and himself.  How he was a slave driver at the roller rink.  Goggins' dad was a hard man and meeted out punishment on those around him.    One of the main things Goggins harps on is being a 'great' man as if this is the ultimate ideal to shoot for.  Does he not realize his dad had the same goal?  In order to become great he punishes himself...and has come to enjoy it.  In a way he is taking his father's approach and turning the punishment inward.  According to Goggins, his father was an incredibly selfish, self-serving person.  A lot of Goggins' advice centers around selfishness...and he has three failed marriages to prove it.  He's basically said that the women in his life weren't aligned with his goals (which centered around himself and his own greatness) and he left them.  I'd like to hear more about how he treats his family and the children of his exes.  The fact is the body will eventually break down, we all die, no one gets out alive.  While you can climb the mountain and eat the pain, maybe for life, in the end what is your legacy?  FIghting everyone and everything or selflessly loving those around you?  As hard as Goggins is, you would think he could handle the challenges of a relationship with another human.    This is coming from someone who admires a lot of what he says and stands for.  I am sure thousands of people will be impacted in a positive way particularly in the area of the mental game as it relates to obstacles, challenges, etc.  The point though is that we shouldn't glorify one aspect of the human condition over all others as if that is the be all end all of living a life well, especially if the driver behind it is trauma from someone who used a similar approach to evil ends.",1년 전,1,

@Elena241092,I think what Goggins is referring to it’s that inner feeling that you are achieving your highest potential.

@toowavyydotbiz,"Accordingly, as observing this particular conversation and in being in alignment with a topical point; it can't be argued that Goggins is an upstanding individual, at least, on the surface and the way he presents himself. However, to say that he has, quote, ""Mastered his inner dialogue,"" I'm inclined to disagree. For the sake, a person who has truly mastered their inner dialogue, their inner self, is no longer at war with himself; he has assimilated the positive and the negative natures <voices> into one, coherent unit. the negative voice is not an expression of its own accord, as opposed to a ""created"" voice which serves as a counter. the negative voice that you hear is your own voice according to your present ability to perceive. the ""created,"" more positive voice is such the same; it exists according to your ability to perceive likewise stimuli. these voices are not at war with one another; both serve their unique purpose given various circumstances. as long as a person is at war with the, per say, negative voice, then this person has come into the development of his wholesomely full potential. ah, nonetheless, well played Goggings. 💯",1년 전,0,

@RunNow-gg6dm,"It sounds to me like he has OCD. He keeps checking, waking up full of anxiety just to look if he remembers correctly... reread stuff again and again... which is probably why he dont remember because he keeps checking. His memory works fine he just doesnt trust it. Even running to the point of injury and going back looks like ocd with people washing to the point of bleeding and keep doing it because it's never good enough. The cursing is fine but the way he put Huberman and people who follow him down indirectly when he talks about the people who promotes tools with their sauna and stuff is passive aggresive, and Huberman handle it like a charm. He sounds like a victim ""everyone would bully me, I suffer the most...""  he takes pride of it and get lots of attention and money from it. Victim mentality is not only about whinning and doing nothing, they are often proud of there suffering. He keeps talking about how he was always alone but he always has his mom by his side even if he had to take care of her. He doesnt always suffer and never rest I once heard him talk about how he watch reality tv with his wife for her, keep in mind he only share what build his narrative. Saying stuff like I'm the most discipline man who ever walked this earth, wearing a sweat with his name on it, talking about only him, third person, his success and how much he suffer most than everyone... how others are humans below him as if he wasn't one of us, talking about fictif characters to say that he is them but he is real... Sound like narcissism ! It's not the full picture and it's just for show/business, his here to promote his book that he didnt even bring and wrote. I love the message though going toward what scare you,  beyond pain.. taking responsibility and all, I started running thanks to him but he is no god and he has a lot of flaws like all of us humans do, he seems to only focus on being successful, making it and forgot about humanity. I think he just dispise his past self and everyone who remind him of him, just like his father hated him, he became his own bully instead of building self acceptance and compassion for himself and working toward his goals.",1년 전,1,

@larasolt5910,"Woah is the first thing I could manage to say after listening to this episode of the Huberman podcast. Something struck a deep nerve for me. That feeling you have when you are completely alone with your thoughts and you realize how lost you are, inadequate and not living up to your potential.  I think David Googins perfectly encapsulates this using his body language and his words to describe exactly where the mind goes when you are in a rumination of misery and despair. You can see it in his eyes that he’s been there many times before and I have to say that is more powerful and motivating than learning productivity hacks. These success routines we buy into only glamorize the positive and comfortable emotions which is really a farce in the end because comfort is not going to be the thing that motivates you which is what David Goggins points out. Many successful people sugarcoat and don’t go into the true grit and struggles it takes to be successful. David Googins is here to share the hard truths that nobody wants to hear and think about.  I honestly find it really refreshing to see his genuineness and candor shine through. He is a deep soul and there is no question that his will power is stronger than steel and it didn’t happen overnight. Thank you for this podcast and for the wake up call I needed and many others probably needed too 🙏🏻",1년 전(수정됨),34,

I think it's the wrong question to ask. A better question is ""What journey in life do you want to go on?"". The reason I think this is better is because most of your life is a journey, so you better enjoy the journey!   Let's say your goal is to reach top of Mount Everest. Does it REALLY matter if you reach the top? For me, I'm happy to go half way, I still enjoyed the journey. The goal, lasts maybe one day, the journey can be weeks or months.  I'm writing a book at the moment. I'm enjoying the journey. Do I need a goal that the book has to be out in 6 months, or it needs so many readers or be a best seller? No!  If you enjoy the journey, quite often a successful by product will happen naturally, but pressuring yourself to have a painful journey to meet a goal is looking at life from the wrong angle.

@genevievebetournay198,"Have any studies identified what the aMCC looks like in people living with chronic illness? Daily life with a chronic illness is usually filled with micro sucks and serious macro sucks may come up on a regular basis. These sucks are also often directly related to survival/a willingness to live. I’m sure that there would be differences in these people due to varying levels of challenge, environments, resources etc., but nevertheless, I know that some people persist and thrive through their illness(es), and I imagine that they must end up with rather developed aMCCs.   I know much of the data around this structure is fairly recent, but I was too curious not to ask. (Also I am using language from your video with Chris Williamson because that’s actually where I first heard you talk about the aMCC.)   I wanted to put the question first because the following may be a bit tldr, but I did really want to say thanks Andrew Huberman. I have felt incredibly grateful for all of the content that you put out, not only for my own sake, but for that of the whole world. This episode may be the most compelling one for me to date, as I can’t seem to help writing to you in the midst of racing thoughts and feelings. You presented me with some very valuable knowledge (the info about the aMCC and the real David Goggins), at a very important time.  In this case, the immense gratitude extends simultaneously to David Goggins, for being who he is, and for being honest about his raw and genuine self. I have never had an expectation that I would find people who think in the ways that I do, nor do I feel a need to find them for me to continue thinking/living in this manner. But I may have had the hope, and certainly can’t deny the power of connection, along with the reassurance, comfort, and inspiration that I felt hearing from someone who thinks in this way and is living the life of the stick.   🙏🔥",1년 전,0,

That's the issue why most people struggle, they just follow everyone else and agree. That's why I'm damn successful, but I don't need you to believe me or care. All that matters is I believe me! I don't need validation or approval from others. David does....""look at me l, aren't I so great?"".  Putting himself through all that pain, running when his knees hurt...is it really successful? Not for me.   What's successful is being close to family, being healthy and having lots of time to do what the hell I want at 44, not working. Maybe it's not successful to you and that's fine. But it's successful to me and that's all I care about. Some wanna work till they are 70....I don't.   I would rather enjoy the journey of life and stop following others, stop worshipping them and believe in YOURSELF. Everyone has an independent mind...use it...stop following the crowd, otherwise your just like everyone else...caring what others think....a sheep basically.

At 1:50:00 they talk about supplements. That's exactly what they are, supplements. You can't just chug protein and hope to gain muscle. The only thing you need if you want things to change, is to take action.  and at 1:53:31 Huberman is so right when he talks about how the tip of the iceberg is him being a Seal and doing the Moab and all that other crazy shit.

@kobajourney,"David is the embodiment of a verse from the holy Quran "" لا يكلف الله نفسا إلا وسعها "" meaning "" 'Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear'  So it turns out you never really know how much you can take, unless you’re literally forced into staying strong through certain days. Sometimes it comes as a surprise, even to your own self, and you watch in awe as a new version of yourself starts emerging along with what you’re unexpectedly enduring. It surprises you because, out of all people, you’re the one who remembers how much it hurt when you used to cry yourself to sleep just a few years back, over much simpler issues. Issues that you only wish could have lasted – now that you’ve seen worse. But you only happen to look back at them with ease later for they’re what made you this strong; they’re what made life realize you’re ready to take in more of what it never gets enough of throwing right at your face. This is when you really need to be proud of yourself, more than ever. Because no matter how tough things will always turn out to be, you’ll always find it in you to make it through them.",1년 전,1,

@JamieWilder-fu2xh,"I'm a bit confused on the brain part that grows if you're doing something you don't want to, shrinks if you enjoy it...   For people with Major Depression, getting out bed can be the hardest thing, something they really don't want to do. And they do it. So wouldn't this part grow, and then eventually they'd have the will to take care of themselves better? Like they know they should brush their teeth, sleep and eat well, etc. But they just don't have the will to do so.. I do understand that depression isn't quite that simple, but would love some clarification.   And in my personal experience I might really hate doing whatever habit I'm trying to implement (right now, getting up, out of bed, and outside at the same time each day). I do not want to do it. So, this part of the brain is growing. But eventually, as I know from personal experience, I'll begin to enjoy and cherish those moments in the morning... and then that part of the brain will shrink?

@Nicole-vw2iy,"I strongly relate to this guy in so many ways, but I definitely use carrots in combination with the internal approach. I have lots of trauma and didn’t have a shield either. I also have adhd and cognitive disabilities and every day life is very challenging for me. I too push through and have made some big changes. My faith and motivation to overcome the challenges has been the things to keep me going day after day even though it’s hard. I lean into the pain a lot too and am obsessive with many things. Many people don’t believe I have a cognitive disability or anything because of how high I function, but they don’t see how hard things are. One thing I will say is different about me is that I see a lot of value in everyone, including myself, even when I am not overcoming and succeeding. I learned about ableism in school and how harmful it is. I feel like health and success are important, but it is important to see other people as having value regardless of these things. No one is a piece of shit in my view so I don’t like that ideology. If I had to choose to be friends with a kind person who was overweight and low functioning versus a high functioning fit person who is mean then I will for sure pick the kind person. I would like to be a fly on the wall for the every day interactions he has with people. What are those scheduled times of super love and affection like? I guess he is up front about it and the person agrees so it should be good. I appreciate upfront communication for sure because people do love the lie and self awareness is key. I’m just a bit nervous about the compassion and empathy, but like I said I’d have to see him interacting with people. Maybe he’s a sweety to his woman and family.",1년 전(수정됨),1,

They tell you to “Go have some fun, bro”, “you need to have a balance.” There is no balance with self betterment because the polar opposite of being better is being worse. So finding a “balance” between the two will leave with mediocrity. We were built to be extraordinary. The power we possess in our frame is undeniable, so much so that Goggins is “haunted” by it. Your potential is limitless! Go do it!",1년 전,0,

I have no interest in this disagreement between Goggins and whoever that is Military; valid or not, to what degree there is validity...well that is history and nothing to do with today. After the Military Goggins has done many things that would be impressive even to the Elite Olympic Endurance athletes. Goggins has a warrior attitude not for fighting other people, but his hatred of who he used to be, hatred of his own weaknesses...and he fights his own weaknesses. So he will have okay days and nothing is unusual about that. But Goggins puts in 100% when he is injured and very tired; still he goes for a long daily run.

I will go over and over and over the same page. 22:50 - 23:07 It takes every bit of you to extract greatness from nothing. 34:55 - 36:15 There’s no passion or motivation. It’s just everyday of your life just doing. 43:15 - 45:38 I lived a life so disciplined that I became the person who has all the traits that I admire. But what it took was hard, ugly work that has nothing motivating about it. 50:05 - 50:29 “You we’re blessed with a strong will.” It’s something that you develop, through years of suffering and going back to it. 52:15 - 53:00 There is no fucking life hack. You just gotta do it, and do it, and do it, and do it. The hack is gonna fucking suck. You wake up, you feel like shit and wonder how you’re gonna deal with everything. You can only fight.  56:00 - 58:55 You will never hear me say “I’m missing something.” Because I found it years ago. You find it repeatedly in the suck, to the point where you know exactly who you are by having done this experiment on yourself. You are both the lab rat and the scientist. You create your own self. You choose who you can become by finding your soul, your will, your heart, your determination and courage. And what that looks like is that you are scared and you think everyday to yourself “I’m stupid”, “but I’m gonna figure a way to be smarter.” Vs saying “I just can’t do that.” And there’s no hacks.

I believe I understand where both of you are coming from mentally because I’ve put in the practices to change my life which include writing, learning new skills, new languages, workouts 6/7days a week, and running 20+ miles a week. Minor accomplishments include me landing a role in a feature theatrical film, and running my first marathon. All of this was achievable by the grace of god, mentorship and the reconstruction of my mind. I owe a lot to David Goggins although he would think otherwise but if you see this comment please tell him, I Lamondo Hill II said thank you for helping me face my demons and going back to see them each day.

@chinawyte,"I enjoyed how Huberman seemed influenced by Goggins' energy - I'd never seen him so animated.  I love how Huberman researches the brain/will power/motivation connection and Goggins has simply lived it and has learned it through how he lives.  I admire him (both of them) so much with the one exception being I disagree with Goggins training through injuries.  I want my body to last and since running is destroying my knees, I'm not going to run an ultramarathon...I do endurance hikes and mt scrambles instead. We can all take from bits and pieces of what he says though and apply it to live our best lives.  Sidenote:  I was formerly a flight attendant on private jets and took care of children (from lil ones to grown adults) of multi-billionaires, many of them have been handed so much and there was a mix of poor attitudes and wonderfully raised kids.  After this podcast, I can see how many must have such little willpower after being raised all their lives with anything and everything that they want.  I have also worked in prisons and with former criminals who grew up in poverty and have seen incredible willpower post-prison.  Fascinating.  Please interview Alex Honnold, who is another anomaly of a human (free soloing El Capitan in Yosemite (about 3,000 ft) via an incredibly difficult route with no rope) after also reviewing and comparing his brain scans because what he has done is remarkable as well.

@yaelbloem5090,"Excellent podcast.   The way David spoke the truth about the real struggle of having ADHD, and how focus and learning is so monumentally difficult, and his iron determination to do the work even if it's unbelievably hard...  gives me hope. I'm 52, and have struggled with ADHD my whole life.  School as a kid and teen was excruciating. Work as an adult is just as excruciating. I went undiagnosed only until recently, and only now I'm finally starting to understand ADHD, and how it impacted my life, mentally and physically.   David speaks the truth to the heart of the matter, doesn't sugar coat, is motivating and inspiring.  When he says that listening to so many people on social media who talk about all the ways you can help yourself doesn't really work... and the work can only come from yourself..I mostly agree.  I've listened to hundreds of self help podcasts, and none ""worked"" , none really ""hit home""...  I've learned a lot from listening, yes, and I enjoy them very much. And am greatfull.    But, I think David is right when he says ya gotta dig into yourself find out if you want to do it,, then do it yourself.  There is no other way. Thank you Mr Huberman for a great podcast.❤",1년 전,2,

@lopezjraul,"How does one start doing the hard things? How do you know you actually don’t like doing the hard thing that grows the anterior cingulate cortex? And, perhaps Goggins commitment to doing hard things is what has helped him overcome his ADHD? Possibly other habits and tools as well. All the exercise he does assuredly helps with that. I’m particularly interested in how he has been so persistent and consistent despite having ADHD and doing things he’s apparently not interested in or doing things he doesn’t want to do. One thing that really intrigues me is the vision he had of himself at some point and knowing the person he wanted to be. When you all talked about the carrot and the stick it seemed to me that there’s two carrots in some way not a traditional carrot like an external reward but still a positive future gain so I’m labeling it a carrot though maybe not the right word. That is the person he wanted and continues to want to become and the process itself. But, interestingly the idea of doing things you don’t want to do and embracing the process seem to be a bit at odds with each other. I’d be curious to see how these mindsets might be teased out in some neurological tests or neuroscientific experiments. Like is the idea of “love the process” learning to enjoy what you don’t like and does that mindset shift affect the growth of the anterior cingulate cortex? According to the findings Huberman mentioned it seems that learning to love the process may be poor advice if we want to keep strengthening and growing.",1년 전,0,

Talking about how the specific part of your brain grows when you do something you don’t want to do.  The Bible calls us to repent. Repenting is turning away from the temptation in the sin of this world out of love of Jesus. It’s giving up the things that you love because your creator, who loves you calls you to turn from those. In return for that, you sacrifice your Temptations, by turning away from them in an act of love.   This is an a book we have had access to since the beginning. This is so basic yet we break down all these studies and do all this science base research in the secular world to only come back to the same conclusion, yet worded differently.   Let’s go ahead and give God the glory for this incredible life we live in these miracles of bodies and minds. We were blessed with.

@justingoforth8350,"This is also the story of Christ.. To suffer, accept humiliation, to die, and to rise(resurrect). In order to become a new creature born of the Spirit we have to endure the battles through constant observation and trial. You must do and you must endure. This demonstrates acts of faith. The fire is transformative. You have to go through hell before the gates of heaven can open. Hell is the prison your mind has cast you down to, but it's a choice to stay there in that prison, separate from the highest good. Reaching the narrow gate isn't going to be easy. That's a promise. Trial and tribulation are a part of this life. Through it all, if willing, you become authentic, a human being that is 100% real who knows his/herself. This is where your treasure lies. This is the kingdom of Heaven. Overcome your demons, by seeing them then know there is one greater inside of you that all those demons must submit to.  Aim towards the highest place so you bring it to the lowest. Integrate all of yourself, regardless of shame, doubts, or persecution. This will help in the participation of slaying your desires, temptations, and passions allowing you to be as true as you can be. It will let your yes be yes and your no be your no. Everything else is noise from the tempter. You stand on the rock where hell cannot overcome. Life is won by emerging out of the fire and being reformed. Keep winning the little battles until the war is done. Then, when inner conflict has reconciled. Your reward will be great.",1년 전,0,

And as someone who was a bullied and quiet pudgy 11 year old when Halo CE came out all those years ago, Chief was like a blinding light of hope to me for wanting to be a fearless man and to an extent, he has done that. My faith in God, too, has strengthened that resolve further, and I intend to set the best possible example for my son to follow in on how to be a strong and reliable leader and to never let his goals be limited by anyone, not even himself.

@arthur83932,"I have a question, I mostly agree with what Goggins said but I still felt like he was too extreme sometimes with the message he's preaching, it gave me the idea that he wants or at least hope for everybody to follow the same path of hardwork he did, and if they don't, they re labeled as weak or missing something. And some parts like when he stopped playing Baseball, which he liked, just for the sake of being hard on himself makes no sense to me. If he wants to live that way I respect him and it's rlly motivating to know oneself can be like that, but in my opinion I really think life should be about equilibrium between discipline and having fun Maybe I didn't get the message or I misinterpreted his message, this is why I'm commenting and I'm looking to hear you guys opinion on it,  because after scrolling trough the comments all I see is people agreeing with it without giving different points of view, it's almost like they re following him just for the sake of it even tough most part ain't doing half of what he is preaching. It's like ""he's right, I'm the problem and I have to change"" without rlly critically thinking about it and wondering how they can apply it on their life, because I know for sure most of the people that say that ain't gonna do shit and maintain the long term discipline he did. Plus he says everyone is an individual and should be different and not follow a pack, yet almost feels like he feels like he's better than everybody just because they don't follow the same philosophy as he does while using the example of random people asking him ""I'm missing something in my life"" and generalizing that everybody who don't live a life full of discipline everyday will  miss something in their life, so his way is the only way.  This is not a hate, just genuine question, because that's what I interpreted from the message he passed on this video, it doesn't mean I disagree what he said fully, I'm actually thankful to hear abt what he said and his message helped in a way, I just don't think he's fully right with it, thank you",1년 전,4,

@lightworker3,"wow- so much to unpack in this one. Going through a dark time, withdrawal from codependency & facing ancestral trauma & demons that were unearthed through my hypnotherapy journey I was beginning to feel like I was going crazy. My thoughts couldn’t shut off- I can relate to the ‘many voices’ of which many were NOT helpful. This to me speaks of energy & other ppl’s energy in our field. I loved everything David said yet a twinge of my heart aches because I DO think we can have healing for these voices to speak more kindly to us- and we can become our own master out of our strength/divinity rather than the shit other ppl programmed us to believe we are from our conditioning or lack of support that sets our programming. Luckily I was able to reprogram and delete the corrupt files. Dr Huberman- I would love you to interview Dr. Mellilo about FDS functional disconnectivity syndrome & he soeaks about tics, autism & ADHD & has amazing treatments. I work with these kids (as a pediatric Occupational Therapist) for over 20yrs & I WAS those kids. Trauma can cause this, also many other reasons but what u experienced as a child with the tics & need for movement in your head & skateboarding/pressure or heavy work- we do these treatments for kids to help them & you were doing your own ‘therapy’. I love my job- helping kids realize they are just wired differently and their brain needs different inputs to organize itself- it’s a great job 🙏🏼 Thx for your podcast- it helps many of our families & fascinating topics- I geek out on this stuff too- never ending expansion & mindset is huge- without a working mind- life is hell. I had to endure it and now can support the mom’s & military families I support. David absolutely had to endure this to teach it❤ his story/life is hard but a blessing & a gift to all who take the time to understand his perspective & knowing ppl will benefit from both your vulnerability shared.

@jasonhamilton9525,"First As much as I like Goggins and still find his words inspirational I think it is important to note that for people who have injuries such as depression, PTSD, or sever injuries his words are occasionally used by people to be abusive to those who are injured and to not feel empathy towards them or help them.   Second  It would be nice to hear that there are situations where his words are not only not applicable but rather harmful to the ability of someone to succeed or heal.  It would be nice if he would spend more time describing his internal and external rituals he uses to compensate for his disabilities and neurosis.  As someone who has dealt with things such as dyslexia and ADHD and who has had to relearn how to read because of a TBI I am aware that the little things we do as mental and physical rituals make a big difference.  As an example; counting your blessings produces chemicals in the brain that can offset depression or that imagining doing physical exercise even when you aren't physically capable of it produces endorphins that help the body heal like you were exercising.  Third As someone who has suffered acute depression and anxiety due to a traumatic brain injury and faced the demons of prolonged suicidal ideation I feel that his words that show a lack of empathy for those who cannot control their emotional state regardless of their physical condition to be very hurtful and dangerous.  People do not choose to stop eating or to commit suicide from depression they are killed by.  If the water was rising on the ocean and you walked across a man who was buried up to his head in hard sand you should not tell him he is weak for and deserves to die if he cannot do it himself.  This is the same as being physically injured with a TBI or other forms of mental illness.   Thank you Goggins for your efforts to help people with your inspiring life and your honest intent to help.  Please consider mentioning a couple small things so those of us who suffer through these experiences aren't cast aside to die whimpering while I families watch quoting your words for why they don't need to feel bad for not helping and ridiculing us.",1년 전(수정됨),1,

@GlimpseIntoTheirNatures,"Wow.  Conscious mind.  Makes sense.  We are in alpha brainwaves when getting our eeg taken.  Thus, the inattentive ADHDers are the Day dreamers.   I detect weight differences which sparks my memory. An envelope with one less piece of paper is noticed my memory remembers its original weight. Yet, to recall factoids on a subject I despise, like calculations for a formula that I'll never use for a test, is awful.  Thus Using kinetic movement, walking and reading outloud these boring factoids, really helped me to set things into memory.    Military people get the training we all ADDers need to succeed. My father had 2 years in conscripted service, and had all the symptoms of Inattentive too.  Yet, he followed suit, got up, got to work, and did his work with percision because of the training in the military.   I however, can see many of us are different from one another regardless of also having ADHD.  There is a ""risk taking"" gene that Goggins may have, that I don't, so to speak. I believe intelligence can be increased, by optimizing the missing ingredients in the body itself, example, B6 = more dopamine, Gaba = more persistence due to less anxiety, etc. Not all folks have the same deficits, but testing will help to decide what to try.  I don't think for example, that Saffron which is being pushed as a Ritalin substitute is for everyone, some of us have sensitivity to even Turmeric so following the crowd, is not a good thing.  Lucikly, we get rejected so often that we don't follow the crowd anyways.",1년 전(수정됨),1,

Greatness is not self defined, it is externally defined and his accomplishments pertain essentially to himself and himself alone. He is a fantastic physical specimen. He is a fantastic mental specimen. He is not a man of greatness sorry. He has contributed virtually nothing to the grand scheme of society and THAT is what defines greatness. There are plenty of smart scientists for instance, but do you know why only men like Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg, Hawking, Durac are considered men of greatness in the scientific community? Because they fundamentally altered the structure of science and our collective, species wide understanding of it. In the ancient world, you know why Alexander of Macedonia, Ghangis Khan, Marcus Aurelius, Cleopatra, Nefertiti are considered individuals of greatness? Because their leadership and ideas, fundamentally changed the course of human history. That is what it means to embody greatness.

Your beginning doesn’t define you, even the external things don’t define you, what defines you is your soul, what you are, and what you will take away from this journey of life.

@mjluna33,"Carl Jung proposed that the only way to become whole & maximize the potential of the psyche was to do the hard inner work in efforts to sublimate, or bring to the surface, the unconscious. Integration of one's unconscious into the Conscious was the way to overcome traumas, complexes, and the hard wiring of our early years. This is where he diverged from and disagreed with Freud. Freud believed we were destined by are formative years, Jung argued that we can overcome all that was embedded early by going into the abyss and bringing to light what has been stored in the darkness.

Nothing to look forward to, no winding down no rest just brute force and suffering? I cant for the life of me understand why.",1년 전,2,

@GlimpseIntoTheirNatures,"This man is a great and determined human.  I had no idea he was in the tribe.  ADHD.  As an inattentive female no one caught on nor did I...that I had this too.  Until 44. I did receive a massive spanking for being late in grade 4.  Lucky I was not a boy that lady (teacher) would have had her ugly wig for breakfast.  I was not hyper.  But heavily timid. I lied about why I was late ever since.  Thank God for a terrible public transit.    My short-term memory for tests required walking up and down my hall while reading outloud. All highlighted in different colours.   I hope he sees this. He could try that.   It adds the vocal to the study and body movement.  That was in the 70s.  In the 90s I was vindicated.  Some Japanese Doctor started to use brain scans and noted that seniors who read out loud retained more.   No scan in my day.  But I figured it out.   I wanted to go to University.  Archelogy,  Art. English.  I could never make up my mind.  So at 36 went to college and got an associates degree. Corp Comm.  I had to quit Computer Graphics Technical the ""professor"" wanted to know my IQ.  My then bf had one of 130.  So I told him.  Me guy has an IQ 130.  And I am the one who caught him.  So I may be smarter.  Should have seen the goof's face.  I quit that course.  Everybody else was saying in 96 that I should have started to get into Multimedia.  30 years later.  That heart ache is still looming over my head.",1년 전(수정됨),2,

@theteleiosjourney,"Good evening, gentlemen.  This podcast has provided profound insights into internal conflict, mindfulness, and taking specific action.  I openly admit that I grapple with my internal dialogue, which often feels like it's tearing me apart on a daily basis.  Now armed with knowledge on how to combat these negative voices, creating a resilient persona capable of withstanding life's challenges and facing inner demons head-on without faltering, while also enhancing and fortifying the part of the brain associated with overcoming obstacles, will undoubtedly have a significant impact on my day-to-day life.  I've taken the liberty of copying some of the transcript and started delving into the newfound knowledge it imparts.  I hope to apply it effectively and wisely, recognising that there's a wealth of insights and battles waiting to be discovered in those metaphorical cupboards. As Mr. Goggins said, 'If you don't know how to fail, there is no victory,' and 'So the first part of my success was learning how to fail properly. And then eventually, I started getting a few victories.'  While the challenges may seem daunting, I'll leave the 'Christmas presents' where they belong. (Haha)  Once again, thank you for the honesty and straightforward explanations, Mr. Goggins and Mr. Huberman. May God spare you to continue influencing more lives positively.",1년 전,0,

@hollowedboi5937,"So far - Even in his mid to late 40s and having enough to live without fighting he's still learning and keeping routine.  He has ADD/ADHD and some other learning and physical disabilities, and therefore has to make up strategies of disciplined routines and doing beyond what you believe you are capable of, despite pain and endless hours because he still is living despite it all.  Pain in perseverance isn't something that can be written, rather it is something to be experienced.   Life was and still isn't easy for him, getting up and going against his former self is a struggle that he chooses to fight to stay on top of it for himself. Social media is feeding to the masses what you do and getting comments in return from people like your former self. Nobody's got you except for you at the end of the day, at the end of life, your harshest critic and forever bonded person.  Return at 31:21",1년 전(수정됨),0,

@hollowedboi5937,"Be vulnerable, how do you wanna be remembered?  personal opinion note I feel like he is the extreme embodiment of hustling, but it doesn't mean we have to be him. I take it more as learn from his life and his discipline lessons you can use for yourself, not a complete roadmap of how to live life. Most of that map isn't for certain and is for us to experience in reality and decide what to do. So for me, I will use his life lessons for the hard times in life and finding that extra resolve and energy within me when I know I gotta do something no matter small. But I'm not gonna be spending every waking hour hustling, only a designated time (example 30 min in the morning lemme go through my emails and to do list from the previous day, 30 minutes warm up figure drawing, then 1-3 hours illustration with breaks in between for stretching, cardio to keep myself woken up, and small walks around the block)  without distraction to do something well everyday. When doing the chores or catching up with someone maintaining friendships. I'd say its more keeping yourself accountable and watching how you change over time instead of letting everything happen passively.  To surmise, find what works for you from role models that you feel envious of being or find some connection with. To paraphrase Trystan Lee since I liked this quote, ""if it works for you, it works."" Same with Goggins if it works for him it works. There's always another way of doing things but find what works for you.   All that being said (@ 58:26 rn) I agree that its a harsh truth but by far a lesson I'm learning everyday that hard times build a person. The stuff that sucks that you don't know how to do or might have set you back a ton in reality or in your mind is what hurts but also shapes you. Its the act of accepting your current reality, having an inner dialogue with yourself both understanding but also objectively, and  overcoming those things or learning how to do those things that you'll grow. With art, finding how you don't know how to do some fundamental and are scared of starting cuz you might mess up, but accepting that's where I am and I may fail but I'll learn from that failure and get better. Or maybe I will do it and I'm just afraid of failure in itself. Regardless I won't know until I start and try it. So I agree with that. ""The problem is you, and you don't wanna fix it.""   Belief versus proof of action. Just like with hell week, people will yell at you and call you the worst of things, maybe shove you around make you go through the worst of it. But continuing through those hard times is what shows you that you're capable. You are capable. Even when it hurts or all the dominoes fall down, the game isn't over.   Focus on one thing at a time don't multitask to give your all to that one thing. If you're gonna mess around then do that fully, don't be between work and your fun. If you're working then focus on just that.   Be you, aim towards something rather than running from stuff and saying what you are not.  Your inner dialogue is a two way street between that voice and how you respond to it. There's a time and place for all actions and emotions.   Teach yourself how to fail properly. Victory is laid in a continuous process of failures.",1년 전,0,

I think it's the wrong question to ask. A better question is ""What journey in life do you want to go on?"". The reason I think this is better is because most of your life is a journey, so you better enjoy the journey!   Let's say your goal is to reach top of Mount Everest. Does it REALLY matter if you reach the top? For me, I'm happy to go half way, I still enjoyed the journey. The goal, lasts maybe one day, the journey can be weeks or months.  I'm writing a book at the moment. I'm enjoying the journey. Do I need a goal that the book has to be out in 6 months, or it needs so many readers or be a best seller? No!  If you enjoy the journey, quite often a successful by product will happen naturally, but pressuring yourself to have a painful journey to meet a goal is looking at life from the wrong angle.

See the difference?!?? Goals DO matter. They effect your results depending on whether you set the goals high or low or whether you just wanna “go on the journey.” Just saying “go on the journey” sounds too chill and passive. Sounds too comfortable and low bar. I wouldn’t use that approach because it sounds like nothing great would get accomplished with that mindset UNLESS you somehow combine it with a “go all out” mindset with it.

The truth is all the actually need is just new bigger goals. All of their goals are probably easy to them at this point. They need something bigger. Not to gain something but to become something more. To experience something more. @billyalexander5645 ,1년 전(수정됨),0,

@nicalgrobbelaar6804,"I am what David would call a ""regular guy"". 33 Years old, happily married, great job, financially secure, friends, family, decent health (not obese), no drug problems, and no problems in general. Since the age 22 I  felt like something is missing. Like I am living a mediocre life and not pushing myself to attain what many religions, philosophers and great minds consider to be what is destined for man. Not ""man"" in inverted commas who lives his life based on reactions to external influences, but one who is truly in control of his faculties and lays out a definite course for his own life.   This goal which I have set for myself has mainly come as a result of the study of the different religions of the world and esoteric subjects and I have no interest in the motivational speaker grind-set mentality. I have come to the realization through my studies that, to achieve my goal, I have to be merciless with myself and lead a life that many would consider miserable. This effort is required not only to reach spiritual goals but also to achieve what I consider to be worldly goals (such as learning a new language, improving my physique or excelling at my job).    I clicked on this video by chance and it is my first time seeing David Goggins, which I have consciously avoided because I considered him as part of the grindset motivational speakers. How surprised I was to hear him express, almost verbatim, the rigorous effort required every day without the feel-good mumbo jumbo. What he says aligns perfectly with the wisdom of the ages without him being over-philosophizing or being religious.   I commend this man and encourage those who dare to walk the path of what I consider to be what God, or nature (whatever your convictions), has destined for man - the man without inverted commas.",1년 전,0,

That does not mean I ever will strive as hard as Goggins, but I value him for inspiring me to be better.",1년 전,9,

@sephblack,"As a clinical psychologist, I'd love to give this guy therapy. He's helped me a lot and I wish I could return the favor. He's still suffering in ways he doesn't need to suffer, in ways that only take away from his greatness, not add to it. I hope he finds his way out from underneath the demons that pile on him every day. I don't think they're required anymore.  This to all ya'll who try to follow Goggins' advice and continually fail: wounds can sometimes propel people to greatness, though less often goodness. More often, they putrefy and poison your mind and spirit, your interactions, your relationships.   Some people are sharpened by fighting themselves.... and the thing about fighting yourself, is that the one you're fighting never goes away. They're always with you. David Goggins says this in different words. He's always fighting himself.  Real talk, I don't see this work very often. Way, way more often I see people blunted by fighting themselves. Down. Hopeless. Ashamed because they can't 'get it', can't beat themselves. Any idea how often an addict tries to gain sobriety using the stick? Almost always. How often do they get sober doing that? Not never, but almost.   Neither of these people are at peace. One of them just has more to show for it. But what if you could be at peace, and be great at what you are called to do? Hell, what if you could actually do what you're called to do, instead of what you're compelled to do so that you're 'enough' and 'worthy'? What if you could rest without immediately reverting to the worst, most wounded version of yourself?  Stay hard, that's the mantra. A mountain is hard. Stones are hard. Both are ground to dust by the soft persistence of water and wind.   Surrender, surrender, surrender. Peace. It's what the Bible is about, the Heart Sutra, The Bhagavad Gita, The Tao te Ching. Set yourself free and see what greatness (and goodness) follows.",1년 전,2,

So I asked myself, what’s so intriguing about him? Because he’s a loudmouth that works out? If he’s really as tough as he says, why didn’t he box or join the UFC?

And that will motivate me to work more for you.  In David goggins case he doesn't have any carrot aka hope for outcome. He will keep on working and working and working and eventually the carrot will be his but he will still keep on working and working. A simple thing to remember which is - do the work instead of worrying about the  outcome because outcome is product of your work it's naturally will come to you,1년 전,1,

It’s not easy, and there are sacrifices that have to be made every day to keep pursuing my college career. But it’s fucking worth it.

@tippiersky4534,"I totally understand and partly share Goggins ethic and the fact that we put limitations on ourselves and immediately shy away from suffering when we should push through. But most of the times I see David or Jordan Peterson and look them in the eyes they seem so full of anger and kind of bottled up energy, one can't help but wonder if all this discipline doesn't cause a lot of repression too.  I guess if one wants amazing results he should be strong and unilateral, but if one wants to strive for a good healthy life, happy by a reasonable standard... we do need laziness, relaxation, joking around and not always be go-go-go. We should have more of a broad-eyed, holistic view (both physically and metaphorically) of life.  I wonder what Carl Jung would say about some ""extreme push"" guys like David Goggins.  And I say this with the utmost respect for the man, what he says is still very very treasurable in this weak and empty society, just wondering about the lopsidedness of it all. Life isn't just ""objective-strife-result"", that seems to me a bit crazy as the only structure one is locked in.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

How he studied and grappled with his internal dialogue, views himself as an artist who is creating himself everyday,  he focuses on what's in his control, which is his own actions, rather than focusing on and being bothered by what is outside of his control.  His self-awareness, reflection, sense of agency to do what is best for himself in order to be his best self is inspiring.  Hearing his story and everything he went through, it gives me a lot of hope and the realization that I have the power to improve myself just like David has.

He also thinks a decent amount about the metaphysical and has some interesting thoughts on spirituality and the supernatural world and how it applies to our practical lives.

@liricabox,"I'm not a super big fan of Mr.Goggins but I respect him and I appreciate his way of expressing his feelings and thoughts of the concept of discipline. I don't know him personally. I don't know how (and why) he became this public figure that he is now and I don't know if he is real or just trying to have succes in the ""motivation realm"". I dont know this and I hope thats not the case but the internet could be a weird place and full of hypocrites. I don't trust people on the internet, even if they are famous. But, whatever if Mr.goggins narrativd its real and honest or not, some of the things he is saying seems interesting and I would like to share my thoughts.  First, I love how he express himself about discipline because It seems very real. Discipline its just doing whatever you have to do. I agree with that. Its very simple concept but its hard to implement (and usually sucks, its a struggle). I agree. But, on the other hand, I feel that he is very hard or strong with his approach, a little extreme. I think that you have to know when you need discipline and suck it. But also you have to know that not everything its discipline. Being relaxed and confort its not a bad thing. You just have to know when its time for each thing. You have to be flexible and goggins seems to me a little inflexible in this aspect. Sometimes I feel like maybe he has an obssesion with discipline and if he is happy and its help him, good for him, but I'm not pretty sure if this approach it's healthy in the long run. I dont think obssesions are good. Having the power of being discipline, I consider this something incredible useful and healthy but also you have to learn to being relaxed and in comfort. For some people being relaxed it's is hard because they feel guilty for not being like grinding or being strong.  The ""always grinding mindset"" I think its pretty popular today, at least in motivational videos in youtube. I dont feel this is good and maybe Mr.Goggins sometimes transmits (to me) that vibes.  Second. Mr.Goggins seems to see things in binary terms. You are a loser (someone without discipline, I guess) or you are a winner. Like I wrote before, I feel like its pretty extreme and I dont feel its a good idea. Things are not so easy. You can have a bad day, being less discipline, even have a lazy week... And what? You are a loser for that? Why? I think its absurd. Until you die, you can change, you have an option. You will change when you have to, when its time. If you get change quickly, beautiful, if not, okey. Life its an experience not a test. The ""I'm a loser"" mentality I feel its a very unproductive way of thinking, maybe even sick way for your own mind. What its the benefit ot blaming and punishing other people or even ourselver for not being discipline X amount time? Maybe you could use blame to have the fire inside you to make the step you need, to have discipline. But it just a little time. I don't feel like Mr.goggins use it in that kind of way.  Third, I love his explanation of his struggles. Even what his problems, he tried to change and It seems like it went good. I really appreciate that. Sometimes I feel like he is enfatize a lot his childhood and his problems to read/write and I get weird vibes with this because I feel like: what he is trying to selling me? Why he enfatize this a lot? But I don't know, Its just the esceptic in me.  Whatever. I have to watch another hour of this podcast but I want it to write some of my thoughts.

@zauberlu,"I admire Goggins and think that I understand his point of view, but if you apply what Paul Conti says in his book about trauma to what Goggins says, it begs the question, what is compassion, then, and why should we be willing to give less compassion when the receiving end are ourselves? I genuinely don't know the answer to these questions and absolutely would take Goggin's approach on many stances, maybe more than 50% of times, cause there's no evidence either that there should be balance or that balance means this or that percentage, but, still, what then becomes the line on the sand, the standard, the clue for when to beat us up, or other people, for that matter, to makes us a better person and find all the answers and for when not letting a subordinate, a relative, a young or an old person, or anyone really, run when they are injured? Life is always complicated and there's no one size fits all solution for anything. I agree, in this sense, with him that there´s no hacking! We have got to figure out everything and these tips we receive from any guest, from Andrew himself, from books we read, from growing up lessons and inner voices are just pieces of a puzzle or part of other structures, which we must define as well. In Goggin's case, it's  clear that he is a very tough person with himself, as if he were two people, and the person who steps up to talk to us in his interviews and books is the one imposing and assessing behaviours. He won't let the other one come up, he keeps this one away with all the swearing, making him feel ashamed for being vulnerable. And we tend to watch this and admire him for putting himself through such hardships. Ok, I agree with it most of the time, but can't help thinking, would I do the same with my children, with people that in my understanding might have had suffering enough without the same opportunities I've had to learn how to cope, and finally how do I know that what I need is always to go running injured, is there never a time to be compassionate with myself? What I mean is, Paul Conti and David Goggins apparently have opposite views on what to do with trauma and I can only tell you that I see value in both and can never step down from how much complicated life is.",1년 전,0,

@noahehrenfried528,Dr. Hubernman i've heared you talking about the AMCC in previous podcasts and i also find it a very interesting structur. But do you know if there is a difference in groth of the AMCC in things that you don't want to do and thing that you don't want to do but have to do? Example 1: I don't want to wake up at 7 am but I do it anyways. Example 2: I don't want to wake up at 7 am but I have to because of school or work. BTW thanks for the great podcasts !,1년 전,0,

@reylo101,"Though what David Goggins is saying makes sense to me yet I feel he is missing a piece of the puzzle. I completely understand where he is coming from and what it took for him to build himself. It's really commendable. Yet I feel something's amiss. I am not judging David at all. God knows I have so many flaws. And his message has came at great timing for me and I intend to implement it. Yet I think there should be a balance between the masculine and feminine aspects of life. I am not talking about gender but the masculine and feminine qualities within each one of us. So there's a place for the tough love and pushing yourself (which is infact very important) and there's also place for compassion and kindness towards self. And both should balance out each other. That would be a holistic approach in my opinion, to lead a life with family, kids and society and also achieve great personal success. I am grateful for having received David's message today and I wish him well.",1년 전,0,
@empoweredwithiggy,I have been coaching people on breaking through their mental blocks for the last 15 years and I can tell you where this grit determination will drive focus discipline hard work comes from for David   Our voids drive our values is a statement that should be more talked about but nobody talks about it in influencer industry because they don’t understand it   You cannot teach someone hunger desire will focus desire that hard work obsessive ethic that comes from within. And it comes from a void in your life that’s so deep that makes you hungry that makes you want to do anything to get to that which you perceive as missing in your life   For a lot of people it’s depression for a lot of people it’s freedom restriction it’s bullying it’s domestic violence it’s being poor it’s not being able to provide for your family it’s not having a roof over your head and growing up in a war torn country. The things that bring us immense pain immense suffering immense sadness are creating voids in our life for things that will help us shift our life mentally and physically.   A person needs to get into deep depression needs to be lazy and fat and unhappy and miserable and horrible feeling of I hate my self for you to get out of that. People don’t talk about this enough they want suppress those emotions they don’t talk about mental health more they don’t talk about things that we perceived as missing as things in our childhood.   I woke with my clients where I take a moment in their life that they perceived as pain suffering and horrible trauma and I equilibrate that for them where they see but most importantly FEEL what that suffering gave them and they balance out the suffering with gratitude and they see the balance and see what it gave them was more than just pain it gave them something that was more important that pain it was TO FIND THEMSELVES   Now we don’t talk about childhood trauma we don’t talk about those things enough yet every single individual who ever made it had a huge void of that thing which they achieved,1년 전,0,

I regressed to a piece of shit alcoholic again in the last 2 years, but hearing this and understanding what I hadn't heard before about pushing through the injuries and pain because if you don't, you'll regress, that's the most relatable real shit I've heard from him. If I'm not running and going to the gym, my demons fester and I'm drinking and smoking that day, and will likely be dead in 10 years. That's worth pushing through any injury even if it means limping, learning ways to overcome at all cost, because the alternative is not an option any more.

@kindboy0001,"IMPORTANT NOTES 👇👇👇👇 14:04  what are you willing to give up to find every bit of who you are as a human being? 18:24  David Goggins said, ""I don't feel bad for people who have ADHD, who have learning disabilities. And some are impossible because you just can't. But a lot of them you can. But people don't want to go through the process of focus, of teaching yourself how to truly focus. This is where my message gets lost"". 19:15 ""Nothing is easy"". 20:21 ""I'm not trying to maximize money or maximize people knowing me. I do these things because maybe someone out there will understand me and get it and say, I can grow from this guy, and others just won't"". 22:06 You have no fucking idea how great you really are because you are using such minimal, minimal of what you have. And if people can learn to focus, this is what's possible. 22:40 The most frustrating thing in the world for me is when normal people judge a man like myself on what it really takes to extract greatness from nothing. It takes every bit of who you are if you choose that route. If you don't, Merry Christmas, do what you got to do. 28:51 No matter how much you improve, no matter how much you change who you are, it's not permanent. 33:10  What life really is for the majority of us is hell. And (on social media) so while people love to show you the cars, and the house, and the vacations and shit, all that's good. All that's happy. I'm going to show you the side that I know most of you are going through. And people hide very well. I don't want to hide anymore. 33:53   Human beings want to show you the best side (of life). And they want to hide the worst side.  36:01 How do you want to live?  How do you want to die? How do you want to fucking be remembered? 38:55 You know exactly what to do, exactly what to do. It just sucks doing it. 40:42 So there is no get-out-of-jail-free card. This is why I say stay hard. Because when you weren't given the gifts, the only thing you can do in life is stay hard. 44:50 Everybody has the ability to do it, but they just don't want to. 45:32 Hard work looks horrible. 46:15  There's a brain structure called the anterior mid-cingulate cortex. when people do something they don't want to do like add three hours of exercise per day or per week It's about adding more work that you don't want to do. This brain area gets bigger. 47:10 The anterior mid-cingulate cortex is smaller in obese people. It gets bigger when they diet. It's larger in athletes. It's especially large or grows larger in people who see themselves as challenged and overcome some challenges. And in people that live a very long time, this area keeps its size. 47:38 In many ways, scientists are starting to think of the anterior mid-cingulate cortex not just as one of the seats of willpower but perhaps actually the seat of the will to live. 57:12 Most people are missing something because they don't know who they are. They never examined themselves. They've never done this experiment on themselves. You create your own self. Most people are missing something because there's so much trapped in there. 1:06:26 If you can't imagine yourself doing something, the person that's doing it is crazy. 1:49:56 Once you figure out your brain, you become unstoppable in almost anything.  1:57:10 Normal people who only have one voice. Never created the second voice. The winning voice is the second voice.  1:58:32  I know why you go on Instagram. I know why you do because you just have the time. You have the time because you don't want to put that time into bettering yourself. 2:11:54 It's impossible to listen to you and listen to what your mind and body are telling you we must do. Because people don't do enough of it. They don't do any of it. They don't have passion. They lack passion, drive, and determination because you haven't spent time with yourself. Your mind will tell you what is next. 2:17:10 There are three voices, strong, medium, and weak. the only way to, quote-unquote, ""know it"" is to spend a hell of a lot of time there.  2:20:02  The path to winning is going to be years of failing first.  2:25:28 psychiatrist Paul Conti said, ""The supercomputer of the brain is the unconscious mind. It's the part of our mind that controls almost everything. 2:26:41 he calls it the cupboards. You have to look in the cupboards. And it's often really scary what you find in there. And most people are just like, I don't even want to know the cupboards are there.  2:30:46 David Goggins said, ""Those cabinets are fucking dusty, dirty, and scary as shit. Broken glass, fucking dark, spiders, cobwebs. But most of all, your biggest fears, the biggest things that put you in a fucked up place you are today are in there. That's why we all like to keep them shut. You like to lock them up. Act like they never happened. That's why you never grow. You never improve. You never have real conversations like we're having right now"". .... stay hard",1년 전(수정됨),36,

@twistymcslide2,"I'm ADD and ADHD , learning disabled , had an IEP, etc . totally felt David when he was talking about his learning process with new info that wasn't absorbed easily.  . I had a really hard time with my schooling,  but the worst was when i went to Hebrew school ,  i just couldn't get it , and the teachers back then didn't understand learning disabilities in general , let alone after school hebrew instructors.  i stressed so much , it got to the point where i just would tape record , and memorize , vs really being able to read the language.  i felt like i was faking it ,  and it really caused a distancing until i was an adult , from the religion .  Kids now are so lucky to have a better support system  , the advances since the 80's/90's have been massive .   the best thing for kids like us , is for people to be supportive of their passions and push that , over specific standard school studies.   My mom was a great teacher , but also my biggest advocate , and representative.  without her id have been tossed into special ed and that wasn't who i was/am .  She did that for all her kids ( students )  . and i wish David had someone in his life when he was younger . but also get being your own biggest critic.   no ones harder on us , than we are to ourselves .   Can also speak on that what we do understand , and have passion for , we excel , and are hyper aware , deeply invested , have a lot of initiative and will overwork as an outlet  , and have great situational awareness  .  .  i wish i could have lunch with David sometime .  wish my Uncle was still around , he was an old timer ultrathon runner based out of AZ and CO  , he used to train with Pam Reed and was on her team for years , and he used to do Leadville , and the Rim race ,  Blackwater , etc. .  his name was Benny Linkhart . was a great man .",1년 전,0,

@derekxiaoEvanescentBliss,"This is an incredibly fascinating interview:   Unsurprisingly, as Andrew Huberman has alluded to, David Goggin's has a mental process that is not at all new. In particular, it has existed in western therapies for childhood trauma (recently ""invented"") and eastern ""spiritual"" practices. Notably,  (therapy) internal family systems; a style of therapy that conceptualizes your inside as wounded and protective parts, that are led by the core self. the more traumatized you are, the more distinct these parts become. at the extremes, you have ""dissociative identity disorder"". when each voice is speaking, the other voices actually don't remember. it's not even distinct voices, it's fractured identities. The therapy works in managing the dialogue between these parts and the core self. the core self is supposed to embody, in part, the values you want to manifest. the core part, i believe, is what you see as ""goggins"", who also relays what the other parts are saying. heavily recommend you look into this NO MATTER who you are, if you are interested in cultivating greater awareness and becoming more like goggins. awareness and introspection is always the firsrt step. this is easier in the presence of a compassionate witness (a good therapist).   (practice/philsophy) buddhism: The buddha, muuch like goggins, had a long period of self introspection where by he realized things about the nature of the mind. One big realization, as andrew huberman mentions towards the last ten minutes of this interview, is that emotions are all just phenomenom. you don't need to act on them. they're nothing ""real"", you don't need to distract yourselves from them (the way an alcoholic might distract from heartbreak or failure by relapsing, or binge eat, etc). Goggins speaks of people who are scared of their internal world ""lowly"", and talks about how introspection is key. andrew huberman mentions meditation as a key practice for self awareness. buddhism is a framework that exemplifies this sort of introspection.   There's many other ""methods"" that are very close to what goggin's describes that encourages introspection. This includes  - somatic experiencing (therapy)  - compasssionate inquiry (therapy) which i don't want to go into detail on.   In any case, it's clear through this interview that 1. mastering your internal world so that 2. you can act with laser focus towards one goal (goggins is willpower. yours doesn't have to be). is the key to goggin-esque success.   good luck.",1년 전,1,

@derekxiaoEvanescentBliss,"I wonder if there is a connection between what viral figures from the ""childhood trauma"" camp like gabor mate or ranjan chatterjee would say about david goggins mental process.   In these camps, a lot of the focus, as far as i understand, is  1. compassionate observation (without habitual/unconscious action) of your emotions/thoughts (for people with childhood truama like david goggins, whose father beat him, it's likely dominated by self critical chatter). You don't just notice the voices, and notice how they drive you to addictive behaviors like binge eating, drugs, work, etc. You also look for the meaning. i.e. ""I have these voices because my father did this to me. the voices and what they say are not who i am, they are what PART OF ME learned to say to myself to survive"".  2. action with awareness: as you cultivate awareness, you'll catch yourself as you reach for that donut, go for the blunt, reach for the alcohol. in those moments, you simply realize, ""Oh, I'm trying to cope with my voices again"". in this space of awareness, you chose to do ""the right thing"", whatever that is. You need to learn what ""the right thing"" is, intellectually, so that at these moments, while being hit by negative voices and emotions, you can still tell yourself what to do,   Simple as it may be, this is a multi year/decade process. In particular, they emphasize that the negative voices and feelings never really go away. You just learn to coexist. these camps are heavily influenced by the buddha.   Funny enough, the buddha and goggins has many similarities. The buddha, like david goggins, was extremely introspective. he spent some years early in his life heavily observing his mind. He came to realizations, then spent time teaching a few heavily interested people to cultivate what he has learned. Funny enough, this sounds a lot like goggins. many people are drawn to the end result of, for goggins, being an invincible highly motivated man, and for the buddha, someone who is fine with everything that happens (equanimity). Just as for the buddha, Goggins also has only met a few people who he thinks really ""gets it"". Goggins is like the modern day buddha, who instead of dissolving inner voices, spent decades cultivating an extremely tailored inner voice: it's tailored to the specific self critical voice that he learned in his infancy/childhood due to an abusive father and for the society he lives in that praises accomplishment/individualism.   I'd say, start meditating. properly. observe your mind. figure out who you want to become. create an inner dialogue that allows you to take actions that consistently bring you to what you want to be.   Goggins manifests the essence of willpower. Due to his history, he fights his subconscious critical voice with a conscious angry/driven voice. You may not need this. and you can pursue the essence of any quality you want. Just as goggins says, he decided to paint the image of david goggins and create that. Don't try to create yourself in the image of goggins, try to find who you want to be.   tbh. I think goggins is overidentifying with the angry voice he created to counter his childhood voice. I don't really understand the purpose of ""not losing the willpower"" all the way up until he dies. The voice served a purpose in getting him out of his slump. It serves a purpose now by inspiring people who are where he was. but he holds onto the voice as his identity. I think it is beginning to outstay its usefulness. His body is breaking down, I wonder how he is as a father (i truly don't now), etc. It's all very interesting. this was an excellent interview. well done.",1년 전,2,

Does this growth still occur the other way around, when we DON'T do something we want to do, like an unhealthy habit? Say you're someone who eats a bowl of ice cream every single night after dinner. You know you need to stop eating that bowl of ice cream every night, but you have a difficult time fighting the craving. If you manage to resist the urge to scoop yourself a bowl of ice cream one night, does that stimulate that portion of the brain in the same way as doing something you don't want to do?",1년 전,0,

By actively resisting distractions and challenges, such as those encountered in the pursuit of difficult tasks, we fortify our willpower.

What I do every time the chimp in my head tries to stop me from doing something challenging, I say “fuck you” to the chimp in my head, it really doesn’t like that.

@girlywhoreads7524,"David made so many good points in the podcast! It was so true when he mentioned that the easy part is listening, but the real work is doing it yourself. Similarly, it was moving when he said that you really know what you need to do, you just don’t want to do it. This was really eye opening in terms of how powerful the mind is. I am a little apprehensive to say this next part, but David himself said you shouldn’t be afraid to say who you really are, so here it goes. When David was talking about how he can tell the truth to a “man, not women because women won’t get this, man-to-man,” my one question is what exactly is so hard for women to understand about telling the truth that only a “man” could get? Overall, great podcast, took a lot of real lessons from David here and Dr. Andrew Huberman you are really amazing for putting out great life changing content every week. I always look forward to the new podcast every week and its really changed my life",1년 전,0,

You can go too far in either direction, characterized as solar or lunar. Buddhist monks that have a hard time walking right because they sit so much on one side, and Goggins has to be the impersonation of the other.

@perfectpersona4334,"David Goggins is not crazy, and I actually believe that like my father, he is a genius that underestimates his own ability due to academic perspective yet actually got through life somehow (will to grow). My father and that side of the family is what I see as pure 'will'. So much abuse, poverty, neglect, crime, all of that and did something about it. I genuinely think David Goggins just needs to learn how to learn, because learning is a skill you can learn to do as well when it comes to academics, and as someone who would try to help people in school I was more like his wife who could grasp it instantly but not be able to explain it and that was what I trained my inner dialogue to do as well, working on language to be able to explain conceptually and now I'm able to literally teach this friend I met in group therapy how to learn so he could do well on his finals, like man we are the most adaptable vertebrates on the planet (i hope thats a safe assumption to make), consciousness itself IS will, mind is will, and being able to manipulate your own mind to see different perspectives, gain metacognition/self awareness of ones own thought processes, and make change is something David Goggins has done exceptionally well, I hope in the academic domain he can learn to creatively conceptualize, that would be hilarious to see David in the future fully articulate exactly everything he knows to those who just dont 'get it' because language is just another barrier for us to overcome and understand to effectively communicate one's own perspective. I can only call it destiny that I share a birthday with him and Jordan, just gives me more drive to impact the amount of people they have as well. Mind is the precursor to reality, manipulating your mind enables you to manipulate reality, and David is the clearest, most blatant example we have of that today.",1년 전,0,

They were probably just having a good time. I threw a fit, and my mom tried to console me saying something along the lines that I was only hurting myself. I knew she was 100% correct. Like David said, we know what the truth is.  I've reflected on that many times over the years. I believe I was addicted to that specific negative sensation of not feeling good enough. The feeling is what is important, but if I had to label it, I was afraid I wasn't good enough.

@wholetthedogin2369,"Hey dr huberman, got a question for ya. Most meditation practices aim for awareness in the moment by simply observing internal and external stimuli, and that seems to put people in a state of contentment in that moment. Assuming this awareness could be brought to every second of your life, wouldn't it be possible for one to be satisfied with that moment no matter what, due to the lack of well, thinking. It's paradoxical in the sense that a way of contentment can only be brought by the lack of thinking and by pure observation, yet people chase the same feeling by doing the exact opposite, working with the future in mind, in the present. In a case where basic survival needs are met, what does this say about the human tendency to Long for a certain ideal in the future? What does the science say behind this feeling of satisfaction due to awareness?",1년 전(수정됨),1,

What I hear Gogging say is he has removed all distractions and choses to ignore / not address all at once, in order to be able to accomplish anything. That's how he's ""trained"" himself ""out of ADD"" as Andrew suggests - he does it by dealing with it. Repeating until it sinks in (which takes much longer for us with ADD when not intrinsically interested in the object of attention). So again, David's structure isn't now suddenly built in a way so he doesn't have to deal with ADD -- he's just learned to deal with it, and it takes work every time.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

I'm the ""I'll go at the quarter hour"" kind of person Andrew described. I love my downtime too much. Goggins inspires me more than I inspire myself, and I think that's the problem I (and many others) have. Goggins is telling us to leave him alone as much as possible and go do what we know we ought to as much as possible.   Thanks Goggins, and thanks Andrew.   I'm gonna go now.

@Navigata1,"Ohh wreched man that I am! - That which I want to do, I do not do... That which I don't want to do, I do - Goggins says, ""Whose gonna carry tha Boats"",  - Paul writes, 'Take up your Cross... You have to die daily to sin'-  In Goggins we have a true to life example of a man that dies daily... by choice--  And now Huberman Explains that what we see in the development of will power is the growing of the Anterior Mid-Cingulate Cortex 🤯 So it just hit me laying in bed this morning-- sin is what we want to do, resisting temptation is what we do not want to do - and if u flee from sin daily... the mind changes 💪🏾 -   When Peterson quotes don't cast pearls before swines, or when the Bible says spiritual things are spiritually discerned - that sounds like the frustration in Goggins voice when he is saying mere mortals just cannot understand Him - His mind is Just Different because of His Choice to Die Daily & take up His Cross of His Choosing -   Training of the Anterior Mid-Cingulate Cortex is found in Scripture - the more we learn about the mind the more we get convinced that the Word of God is True!

@alvarezgamers,"You don’t know me son !!!! I relate so much to Goggins. My dad and mom both smoked crack when I was a child. They were very psychically abusive and both died when I was ten. My grandma died a mouth later. I was thrown in a group home from the age 10 to 18. I was in special ed and they said I was emotionally disturbed and learning disabled, which is something easy to be when your parents beat the hell out of you as I kid... Then I was homeless in my early 20s.  When Andrew said, Goggins had no one to shield him from the world as a youngster, I could so relate to that, when you have no protection from the world - it makes you extremely tough. Fast forward 20 years later, I have two masters, a brown belt in jujitsu, two licenses in my profession ( clinical social work) and have two great young sons I pour all my love into. Ironically enough I still feel very unaccomplished and still push myself as if I'm homeless and a messed up abused child. I also relate to Goggins when he said his rich friends always come to him and say ""I'm missing something"". I always tell them you look for your wealth to bring you happiness but it will never bring you true happiness. It will buy you nice things, but until you really live for who you are, nothing matters.",1년 전(수정됨),1,

We look for better answers than what we have because we assume smarter people than us already figured it and did some science to prove it but sometimes we already know what we need to do and want to find someone to tell us no do it like this and it's gonna be better.  I've struggled with this for years and am just now able to get my head around it.",1년 전,2,

@MinomeEslinde,"In therapy and life coaching there is this instrument called ""tactical spite"" which if appropriately applied in the correct context and situation, is very powerful and constructive. Whenever people (from the crab bucket) say you are not able to do something because of reasons, then some people weaponize that talk to show them wrong, by doing it anyway, successfully. For crabs in the bucket and for gatekeepers of the higher layers, this breaking beyond the preset confines is terrifying. But for mutual-growth oriented supportive friends, this growth  is an  awesome thing to see. In  both his audiobooks, Goggins gives options to adapt to your own needs and your own path, explicitly telling the listener or reader, to not follow his. Create your own flavor of progress.",1년 전(수정됨),1,

@JP-zl9qx,"The part on inspiration, character, and self image is very interesting. As kid who grew up mostly without a father figure, I remember vividly using the same mechanism, especially around teenagehood. I would pick up parts of fictional characters to build up and ideal version of what a man had to be; of the man I wanted and needed to be. This ideal is one of the most important thing that helped me keep my head above the water. Just like Goggins - even though maybe not to the same extent - I can't say that I was born with the brain of an academic. Most of my school years were a pain in the ass. Yet, through consistent work and with the support of my parents, I am now a masters student in Philosophy. I haven't had to make it all alone like Goggins did, but I can relate on the feeling of building one's identity, a process that's highly important especially as men. A friend of mine, who's a university teacher in psychology, once said to me that it was a miracle that I could develop the way I did considering the childhood I had. She's probably right, but we are living proofs that it's always possible to make it.  Thank you for sharing your story and thank you to Dr Huberman for making this deeper dive in Mr D.

My response was because I hated it and have no reason not to. To build discipline. Now i can share actual data for my why.  1:05:15 makes sense why it gets harder(mentally) when you fall off.

@justinwejsa1256,I think people misunderstand him because nobody is supposed to. Not just him but any individual. It is so rare for people to be themselves. Which understandable cause the only people that know if someone is doing that IS OURSELVES. People can know (think they know )someone for a lifetime and   actually never know who they really are. Cause that’s just determined by the person themselves. That’s why it’s so easy for people to just end up living their whole life as a lie.  one thing I noticed when he was talking about society telling you to be soft on yourself and what not.. he doesn’t even realize (I don’t think he does anyways?) being you is exactly just that. So many things play factors to being your own true individual . Literally everything you do each second of the day plays a factor if you’re being that or not. It could be a never ending conversation. That’s what makes it so interesting cause every person is going to come up with their own answer.,1년 전(수정됨),0,

In regards to the cursing I heard that there is actually a better use of indering higher tolerance pain for longer when cursing. Where and how would this be seen in the brain?  I loved to hear that you believe in god and state that openly. I am writing a book about the benefits of believing in god. For example, practicing different forms of prayer as a type of meditation.

@chroniclesoftheunknowm,"That was so fucking real. When he mentioned on how he's misunderstood and people will take him out of context is something I relate to on a small scale. My own family members don't understand what kind of journey I'm trying to embark on. They don't see the way I talk to myself. Even if I tell them, they don't understand. I don't want them to understand because they're not ready to mentally go through what I'm trying to go through. Cleaning those dark cabinets is never easy, they are not ready to clean those cabinets. Realizing that I'm the only motherfucker that can work on myself and no one in this world can do that for me. I'm ready. As I say this I'm aware those voices are telling me different, but I need to learn how to gather all of them to agree on doing the challenging stuff and to quit avoiding them because that is not the life I want to keep on living. Even writing this I'm going to be misunderstood. All you need to know is that David Goggins is one of the realest motherfuckers I've ever witnessed in my life. I don't expect to meet him at all in this life, all the I care about is that I'm putting in the work in for myself every fucking day because that's the fucking life I want to live. No one can hold my hand and walk me during those tough challenges. Yeah, they can cheer me on, but no one has access to my own mind to cheer me on internally.

@marci.yoga.teaching,"Yes, that portion of the brain could be called Goggin’s part! I have stronger willpower than most people and I relate to that fire within him he ignited. I don’t always want to do stuff, it sucks, but I do it and each time I overcome the weak part of myself I grow stronger.  So Goggins whether he likes to be a model for this or not is reminding us of the fire we all have within if we don’t baby ourselves all the time with stuff which feels good and comforting.  I water fast for 10 days every year (many reasons) and people think all sorts but it empowers me on all levels and if challenges come I think ‘well I survived 10 days with no food I can get over this, too’. We just need to learn discipline but we are like little unsupervised children let to our own devices, constantly self-sabotaging by default. And thank you!

@ip-sum,"If I remember correctly from your willpower/tenacity video, wasn't there a difference between being aware of the fact you're going to do something you don't want to do, and being ""forced"" too,   What I mean is, wasn't there a difference between feeling helpless or something similar, and having the intention of doing something you perhaps did not want to do, where you get more of the positive physiological and or mental responses, as opposed to just the negative?   For instance, is there a difference between lets say your hot water heater is damaged/malfunctioning whatever, but you need to shower immediately to prepare for something and leave within 10 minutes, and now you need to take a quick cold shower, and you hate the idea of it, but you are unaware of the idea of this being a potentially beneficial act?   (Or what if you planned on your shower being an attempt of cold water exposure that morning anyway, you could even be completely unaware of the fact you don't have hot water?)  So would that fall more into the category of ""negative"" stress, and would it still positivity affect the growth of your AMSC? Or is that out of the window because you're just hating this moment and idea and see no positive angle here, it's just a frustration?  Sorry if this seems scattered/poorly worded, but what I'm saying is, and I'm trying to consider your other guest, Anna Crumbes work on mindset here, if I remember correctly she had mentioned if you're lets say considering the more ""negative"" aspects of stress, you're more likely to suffer from the negative consequences,   as opposed to focusing on the more ""positive"" physiological responses, you're more likely to have a positive outcome.  So if I'm only considering the negative aspects of stress, (let's say my mindset/only reference of Stress is hyperfocusing on all the negative aspects) Seeing how that's all I am aware of in that moment, I'm possibly leaving ""money on the table"" so to speak, and missing an opportunity to benefit from something, possibly even just causing harm even to myself instead?  I'll have to finish/rewatch the other videos, but the human body is so fascinating, it's the same moment in time and your perspective on the ""issue"" could possibly dictate completely different outcomes and effects on your health, etc.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

@Iloveyouman555,"This was special Andrew. I feel this podcast gave us all a true insight and window into who you truly are. I’ve watched over 200 podcasts of yours and never once have I seen the fearlessness or truth you’ve spoken with such conviction as I did here. I feel that Goggins brings that truth out in all of us; whether we choose to believe it or not. I also believe each one of us here on this Earth has a greater potential than we want to know is true and we are able to push past the barriers of our minds and restraints we create for ourselves commonly known as our “reality”. However, it’s up to each individual whether they want to undergo the grueling journey of the suck, and the process of what it takes to truly become the best version of self  I feel a massive shift occurring in front of our eyes. Society as a whole is rapidly evolving and turning into this world that we wouldn’t have recognized even as recently as Five years ago. Five years, that’s about 1800 days. And I can firmly stand on the fact that we are a significantly different, evolved and have a more diverse mindset as humans than we were back in that era,  And also feel a vast majority of the reasoning for this newfound mindset of society is because of people like you and David; who’s ultimate goal is to show others what you know as your truths and purpose work. And by sharing them without hesitation, reservation or fear, it gives me the ambition and motivation to continue in my own personal journey of finding what my purpose work, life goals and personal truths are for self. Thank you truly from the depths of my heart for providing this content free of charge, your work has inspired me in ways I didn’t know were possible and has opened doors into consciousness and considerations I didn’t know I had prior to consuming your content. And I’m sure many others, if not the vast majority reading this, feel precisely the same. You fucking rock dude  Stay Hard my fellow citizens of this orb floating through Space 🫵",1년 전,4,

You could probably even make a separate episode with the answers 😂. I do realise that my comment is quite a time-consuming ask and appreciate that you are very busy. However, I’m sure that everyone can benefit from your responses nevertheless.  You mentioned that the Anterior Mid Cingulate Cortex expands when you do something that you don’t want to do.  1. Is it conditional upon you perceiving the task-at-hand as something ‘constructive’ and/or something you know you should do but have been putting off?  2. Conversely, does it also operate in the same way if you abstain from engaging in a task that you want to do? Again, is that dependent on whether you perceive the task as being constructive?  3. Are there any other factors that contribute to the expansion and contraction of this structure?  4. Are there any other brain structures that expand and contract simultaneously with the Anterior Mid Cingulate Cortex?",1년 전,0,

@Zenzonevibezzz,"To summarize Goggins (since he refers to himself in 3rd person).  Just Do It.   And save yourself from listening to this 2 hr non stop negative rant of how he sees life. The only good parts were when Huberman added scientific value. I am not trying to slag. It's just not my thing and it's not positive nor does it go literally anywhere. Just repeating the same sentence for 2 hrs.  The guy needs therapy. Or maybe today wasn't his day.   He did not even talk about all his challenges and just expects the listener or viewer to already have prior knowledge of the guy. I find that a bit self-involved (just like referring to himself in third person again); he thinks that no one else has ever been through what he's been through.   He had 2 hours to inform the public of strength training for each trauma or challenge he went through, and yet he dummed it down to basically "" ""just do it"" with a bunch of F words.",1년 전(수정됨),4,

While I have found David extremely motivating and am grateful for the lessons he has learned and expressed to others, there was always a vibe of anger or some form of discontentment there. Perhaps it is because I am very different from that, a warm-hearted, gentle, and kind person. David says he knows what is bad for him and what is good, and that he has anger that will never go away. Maybe he is right and that is powerful to know yourself in that way, but part of me thinks the anger can be addressed and learned from. It's an interesting concept.

@muradmeansdesire,"""Man, you are a David Goggins"" a person in my gym said to me as I finished running 15K in the treadmill. Someone was noticing as I was running and sweating like a water hose   ""Who?!!!"" I asked as I was not aware of him. Later I saw his messages in different you-tube videos and then I collected two of his books ""Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds"" (his story is better than many fictional stories/movies I read/saw) and ""Never Finished: Unshackle Your Mind and Win the War Within"". His name becomes an HONOR (my best achievement in GYM life) in this world of COMFORT  Your very easy to understand explanation of ""Anterior Mid-Cingulate Cortex"" and timely relating that with David's application & execution is one of the fascinating points of this wise and inspiring discussion. Neurological footprint of WILLPOWER has the capacity to unleash massive potentiality within us (popularly known as human) - the most complex system in known universe   in my judgement David is the ICON of WILLPOWER. Hey Andrew, please consider bringing Kelly McGonigal who wrote a wonderful book on willpower (THE WILLPOWER INSTINCT) with many applicable learning. Your very sharp and goal oriented questions (and above all authentic LEARNING INTENTION) will make the thought exchange immensely valuable for us on this abstract concept (WILLPOWER) - the learners   Andrew (1) + David (1) = 2, nah it is 4, nah 20 ... 2024.

@TheZeromega,"In some way, it's like creating multiple personas or even personalities, not in a pathologic way but in a delibarate and healthy way. Being the limbic brain the default, stronger and louder voice, prefrontal cortex the logic voice, and the soul you which sometimes may team up with any of the two, or fight the two. I believe this is part of the translation between david knowing how to crack the mind up from a non cientific explanation, and Andrew bringing the interpretation of translating some of the under the hood neurocircuits which explains how we can understand better david's explanations. Some of us want a detailed explanation on how something works, others don't need that and just by knowing that some process works, then they'll go by it. I would love to get you andrew, david, jordan peterson, jocko and joe rogan into a table to talk these stuff out.

@DiegoHenriquePereira,"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  00:00 📚 David Goggins é um ex-Navy SEAL, ultramaratonista e autor de best-sellers que passou por uma jornada de transformação pessoal incrível. 00:29 🥇 Ele é conhecido por suas realizações no mundo do esporte, incluindo ultramaratonas e recordes mundiais de flexões. 02:23 🧠 Nesta conversa, David Goggins compartilha sua mentalidade e a importância do diálogo interno para alcançar autodisciplina. 03:19 🤬 O episódio contém linguagem forte, então não é adequado para todos os ouvintes. 04:45 🍖 Patrocinador: Maui Nui Venison oferece carne vermelha altamente nutritiva e saborosa. 05:42 ☕ Patrocinador: AeroPress é uma maneira excepcional de fazer café de alta qualidade. 06:40 🛌 Patrocinador: Eight Sleep produz capas de colchão inteligentes para melhorar a qualidade do sono. 11:31 📖 David Goggins compartilha seu processo de estudo meticuloso para se tornar um paramédico e aprendiz de medicina. 15:46 🏃 David Goggins descreve como sua abordagem mental muda quando ele está estudando em comparação com quando está correndo, ambos exigindo intensa concentração. 19:30 🧐 A jornada de David Goggins para alcançar a grandeza requer um alto nível de foco e esforço diário. 20:25 🧠 Friction é crescimento. 21:23 🌟 A importância de enfrentar desafios aparentemente insuperáveis para alcançar a grandeza. 23:48 📘 David Goggins compartilha princípios como ""perform without purpose"" e ""callus your mind"" para ajudar as pessoas a se superarem. 27:35 🤔 Ser assombrado por sua própria situação pode ser o impulso necessário para a transformação. 33:41 🥺 Goggins enfatiza a importância da vulnerabilidade e de enfrentar a realidade da vida, sem esconder os desafios. 42:11 🌟 Encontrar felicidade não era o objetivo de David Goggins quando ele estava em situações difíceis, mas sim superar os desafios diariamente. 44:07 💪 David Goggins se tornou quem ele é hoje ao construir sua própria versão de um homem forte, inspirado por personagens fictícios que admirava. 45:04 🚀 Desenvolver força de vontade e coragem é um processo que envolve enfrentar desafios difíceis e superá-los, mesmo quando não se quer. 46:31 🧠 A pesquisa científica mostra que o crescimento da área cerebral chamada ""córtex cingulado médio anterior"" está relacionado à capacidade de fazer coisas que você não quer fazer. 52:46 🤯 Não existem atalhos para construir força de vontade; a chave está em enfrentar desafios e fazer o que é difícil repetidamente. 57:06 🌟 Muitas pessoas sentem que estão faltando algo em suas vidas porque não exploraram plenamente sua força de vontade e coragem para enfrentar desafios. 01:00:33 😰 Construir força de vontade pode ser assustador, pois desbloqueia uma compreensão profunda de quem você é, mas muitos evitam esse processo. 01:02:55 🧠 A estrutura cerebral chamada de ""anterior mid-cingulate cortex"" é ativada quando enfrentamos desafios físicos ou mentais. 01:03:23 🧠 A anterior mid-cingulate cortex também está ligada à liberação de dopamina em resposta ao atrito e à dor, não apenas ao prazer. 01:03:52 🧠 Essa estrutura tem neuroplasticidade, ou seja, pode crescer e encolher ao longo da vida, mas requer manutenção constante. 01:06:10 🧠 A mudança real requer esforço constante e a capacidade de superar a resistência interna que impede o progresso. 01:07:29 🧠 A maioria das pessoas evita o desconforto e a dificuldade, optando por uma vida medíocre, mas depois lamentam a falta de realização. 01:08:56 🧠 Muitas vezes, as pessoas se concentram nas condições do passado que as tornaram bem-sucedidas e não percebem que podem mudar a qualquer momento. 01:12:37 🧠 Para fazer mudanças significativas em sua vida, você precisa acordar algo dentro de si mesmo, mesmo que seja uma ilusão inicial. 01:15:54 🧠 Mudanças significativas na vida são difíceis e muitas vezes desagradáveis, mas é necessário criar uma motivação interna poderosa para superar os desafios. 01:19:10 🧠 A procrastinação e a espera pelo momento ""perfeito"" podem impedir o progresso; comece a agir imediatamente, independentemente da hora. 01:23:28 🗣️ Honestidade e comunicação upfront são essenciais em relacionamentos para evitar frustrações e mal-entendidos. 01:25:52 💪 Construir confiança em si mesmo pode exigir sacrifícios e desequilíbrio em outras áreas da vida, mas é fundamental para o crescimento pessoal. 01:31:00 🚀 Ser verdadeiro consigo mesmo e comunicar quem você realmente é permite viver uma vida autêntica e empoderada. 01:37:11 🧭 A verdade é o ponto de partida, e a autenticidade é a chave para uma jornada de crescimento e autoaperfeiçoamento. 01:39:34 💡 Dependência de elogios externos pode ser prejudicial; é importante buscar motivação interna e reconhecer suas próprias conquistas. 01:41:01 🧠 David Goggins destaca a importância de construir uma força interior através do trabalho árduo e da autodisciplina, destacando que ele treinou e realizou 99% de seu trabalho sozinho ao longo de sua vida. 01:41:30 💪 Ele enfatiza a capacidade de extrair energia e paixão profundas de si mesmo, resultado de anos de treinamento solitário e autoconstrução. 01:42:57 🔥 Goggins compartilha sua motivação, que provém do trabalho não visto e das lutas internas, em vez de depender de reconhecimento externo ou motivação externa. 01:44:23 🧪 Ele ressalta a importância de construir um ""armário de remédios mental"" interno, onde a verdadeira confiança e resiliência podem ser encontradas, sem depender de estimulantes externos. 01:46:45 🤔 Goggins e o anfitrião discutem a importância de se concentrar na jornada pessoal de crescimento, em vez de se apegar a suplementos ou métodos externos. 01:57:29 🙌 David Goggins expressa sua frustração com os críticos e trolls, enfatizando a necessidade de coragem para buscar a autotransformação em vez de desperdiçar tempo julgando os outros. 02:01:53 🏃 David Goggins destaca a importância de fazer o que você odeia, como correr, com paixão e determinação, mesmo quando inicialmente você odiava. 02:02:21 🔥 Ele compartilha a ideia de ""cap success"" (sucesso limitado), indicando que se você não continuar desafiando-se e fazendo coisas difíceis, seu sucesso é limitado. 02:05:36 👁️ Goggins destaca a importância de ser honesto consigo mesmo, ter autenticidade e olhar nos olhos de outro homem sabendo que você está falando a verdade. 02:08:00 🧠 Ele discute o processo de ir para dentro de si mesmo, encontrar diálogo interno e, em seguida, transformar esse diálogo em ação concreta. 02:10:21 🎨 Goggins compara o processo de autodescoberta e ação diária a ser um artista que pinta uma obra-prima única todos os dias. 02:17:06 🗣️ Ele enfatiza a importância de dominar o diálogo interno, incluindo ouvir diferentes vozes dentro de si e tomar ações com base nesse diálogo. 02:22:28 🧘‍♂️ Praticar a capacidade de ignorar vozes negativas e continuar perseverando é essencial para alcançar o sucesso. 02:25:17 🧠 A mente inconsciente desempenha um papel fundamental em nossas vidas, e entender como ela nos afeta é crucial. 02:27:13 🚪 Abrir os armários escuros de nossas mentes e enfrentar nossos medos e traumas é necessário para o crescimento pessoal. 02:30:30 🌌 A jornada para o sucesso começa com a limpeza dos armários mentais mais sombrios e assustadores. 02:33:50 💪 A autenticidade e a honestidade consigo mesmo são fundamentais para inspirar os outros a enfrentar seus próprios desafios internos.

@thetonyfusco,"Great podcast Andrew, among many others. This one was however so very authentic, raw and brutely articulated. It resonated with me as I also can be at times be extremely brutally honest. So there’s that part of me that can very much relate, however I’ll admittedly say that my anterior midcingulate cortex is pea sized. At 45 years I still have so much personal growth to achieve. It’s just like Goggins says, we all know what we need to do. I also just wanted to personally thank you Andrew for what you do.",1년 전,0,

@vhaalgorn,"I was thinking about this brain structure and the possible evolutionary reasons for why it behaves in such a way. 'Friction' is correlated to work, and works can improve things. So it make sence for an animal that does a lot of work, and therefore goes through a lot of friction, to live a longer life, it is advantageous for the species because more things gets built. As opposed to an animal that is simply sitting arround, consuming resources. Evolutionary speaking, it would be advantageous for the species if the animals that go thorugh a lot of friction to live longer, and the ones that avoid friction live shorter lives, resources would be distributed more optimally.",1년 전,0,

@melvin6228,"David Goggins + Andrew Huberman is a lethal combo when it comes to my personal development. In my mind I call the two of them David Gugerman :') I respect the combination of them the most.  I could relate with Goggins his message in previous shorts/clips/videos, but I found the way he messaged it too rash and therefore unnuanced. I've taken more unnuanced advice to heart in the past and it always has hurt more than help more. So I was always wary to go fully all in, and to do David Goggins advice for like 50%, I wouldn't see how that would work. Andrew Huberman is his nuance. Knowing what the anterior mid cingulate cortex (aka The Cookie Monster) does is amazingly helpful to nuance David Goggins his advice. I can now fully go all in.  The nuance is to be wary of the ""suck worship"" trap.  The will of the warrior needs to be present, knowing what to do is always there, and if it sucks then embrace it. This is the path that this podcast is inspiring me to take, which is slightly different than what I'm hearing from David Goggins. David Goggins gives me the impression to always embrace the suck. He paints the picture that the suck is always there. For me, it isn't always there. It's there often, but by far not always. I wonder if David Goggins sees that since his whole life seems to suck (which I doubt since he must have had beautiful moments too and it seems he doesn't expand on how the suck relates to the beautiful parts in life). I think there's a danger to that which I call ""suck workship"". I think the suck shouldn't be worshipped but respected. One shouldn't always want to be in a state of suck but simply know to their bones that when the going gets tough then IT'S ON! And when it's on, it's time to take some souls. The mentality here is a life or death mentality.  I think one should strife to do their best in life. Sometimes that can feel good, and sometimes it can feel bad. No matter how it feels: do it. Whenever I listen to David Goggins his message feels more like ""always choose the path with more pain"" and to that I can't relate. Pain doesn't always lead to growth. Going for what you want with humility and dealing with all the obstacles in the way, that leads to growth. In many cases, the fact that it sucks is an obstacle that needs to be cleared. Sometimes it doesn't have to suck though, and that's okay too. I wonder what David Goggins thinks of that, because if he agrees with me then that part of his message gets lost. Not every important thing worth fighting for is an arduous path of torture.   Sometimes, the most important things worth fighting for is more like a nice hike in the Swiss alps with your loved ones. It still takes effort, but I mean come on.  Hiking.  In Switzerland.  With loved ones! It's beautiful to do that, let's fucking go, 100% all in. Goal cleared in no time.   Trying to always find and embrace the suck is in my opinion yet another small form of comfort seeking. To me it seems that suck sucks the most when it comes unexpected. There's a small type of comfort in when the suck is expected by always seeking it out for example. To be able to deal with the unexpected suck, I believe that I should train my equanimity (I do it by meditation but I could also do it by working out or studying hard or doing something emotionally hard).   In both cases (whether doing something sucks or doesn't), the message I've received in this podcast is to always have the inner warrior present. Since in essence it's always about life or death. And to this Goggins gives a clear thought: ""thinking like that is way out there for most people, it's insane to them."" Here he rejects ""the common man"". Knowing that he does confronted me with that thought and made me reflect, and I agree with him based on my own experiences. I know personally that when things are felt that sharply (life or death type of thinking), then I become unstoppable. I know in CBT that this is a cognitive distortion (it's all or nothing thinking). Yet, here David clearly shows that this type of thinking is what has helped him. And I do think that CBT categorizing ""all or nothing"" thinking always as a bad thing seems overblown to me. All or nothing thinking has pros and cons to it, and the people that need CBT seem to be suffering from the cons too much. The pro is that it fires me up as it does to David. That is a big pro.  I have a suspicion that to David Goggins it also always is about life or death, but I might be projecting a bit too much now. In any case, the point I got from Goggins is that one has to fight to self-actualize (as if they're fighting for their life). Sometimes that fight is easy, sometimes it's hard, but without that mentality, self-actualization can become difficult because of one's inability to embrace the suck. Maslow said: ""What one can be, one must be!"" If one can't embrace the suck then one can't self-actualize.   Like Wim Hof says ""the cold is my friend"". The message I got here is ""the suck is my friend, and when it's around, it's time to take some souls."" Sounds extreme? Yep, but when thinking about this podcast I'm clearly getting the message that this is what it takes to get to where I need to be. And I agree.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

The idea that meat is bad for glucose is ridiculous since meat doesn't contain glucose I will NOT be using Inside Tracker.",1년 전,0,

I've noticed a lack of visibility for women experts in your program when, in fact, there are highly qualified women experts across all the areas you cover.  Women bring unique perspectives, life experiences, and different bodies, which may not always be fully captured by a male perspective. Women scientists have made invisible in science over time.  I hope in 2024 we see more fairness and equality in the choice of interviewees. Let's make sure all voices, including those of women, are properly represented. Thank you Andrew!",1년 전,0,

@ritikasharma-v1q,"00:58 Despite a difficult upbringing, obesity, and low prospects in his 20s, Goggins transformed his life through an inner dialogue that led to becoming a Navy SEAL, ultramarathon runner, and successful author. 01:53 The podcast explores the unique inner dialogue Goggins engages in for self-discipline, delving into the mindset, scientific aspects of willpower, and his current pursuits, including studying medicine. 04:18 Sponsors of the podcast include Maui Nui Venison, AeroPress, and Eight Sleep, each contributing to the episode's production. 08:07 Goggins is commended for embodying discipline and tackling hard challenges. The conversation highlights his current focus on learning and studying, particularly in the field of medicine. 13:51 Goggins reflects on his struggle with ADHD and the process of teaching himself how to focus, expressing empathy for others facing learning disabilities. 19:30 Goggins discusses the constant friction and challenges he faces daily, emphasizing that everything he does requires a high level of effort and dedication. 21:23 David Goggins reflects on his challenging background, physical limitations, and military disqualifications, emphasizing the importance of overcoming obstacles through relentless effort and focus. 27:35 Goggins reveals the haunting impact of his difficult past, detailing the mental and emotional challenges he faced in trying to overcome societal judgments, racism, and personal limitations. 37:01 The conversation explores Goggins' relentless pursuit of self-improvement, highlighting the absence of positive reinforcement (""all stick, no carrot"") and the continuous internal battle he faces to prove himself wrong. 39:50 Goggins delves into the constant self-doubt he battles, particularly during challenging moments, and how he must consistently outwork his own negative self-perceptions to succeed. 41:14 Goggins emphasizes the absence of a ""get out of jail free card"" in his journey, advocating for the mindset of ""stay hard"" and the necessity to outwork one's inherent limitations to achieve personal growth. 46:31 The anterior mid-cingulate cortex, a brain structure, grows when individuals engage in activities they don't want to do. It's linked to willpower, challenges, and overcoming adversity. 48:25 The key to developing the anterior mid-cingulate cortex is consistently doing things that are hard and uncomfortable, not just more of what you enjoy. Friction, discomfort, and facing challenges are essential. 55:11 The lack of friction, challenge, and struggle can negatively impact individuals, even those born into wealth. Goggins emphasizes the importance of the ""stick"" and being haunted to drive personal growth. 01:00:04 The anterior mid-cingulate cortex gets activated when the body is pushed to move despite resistance. It's associated with the dopamine reward pathway, indicating that pain and friction can trigger a sense of accomplishment and pleasure. 01:05:44 David Goggins discusses the plasticity of the brain and emphasizes the concept of ""no days off"" to facilitate personal growth. 01:07:29 Goggins criticizes the prevalence of mediocrity, expressing frustration at people's reluctance to put in the necessary work to improve their lives. 01:10:48 Goggins discusses the tendency of people to attribute past success to external conditions, highlighting the importance of recognizing personal responsibility. 01:11:44 The conversation shifts to addressing the difficulty people face in making positive changes in their lives, particularly in areas like weight loss. 01:13:04 Goggins challenges individuals who resist change, emphasizing that they need to create a false reality to overcome mental and physical obstacles. 01:14:27 Goggins warns against relying solely on external sources for motivation, stressing the importance of self-exploration and examining one's internal desires. 01:15:25 Reflecting on his weight loss journey, Goggins highlights the ongoing struggle and emphasizes the harsh reality that positive change is challenging and uncomfortable. 01:17:44 Goggins shares examples of friends who made significant positive changes in their lives after a single conversation, underscoring the role of self-criticism in triggering transformation. 01:20:36 The discussion touches on personal weaknesses, such as procrastination, and Goggins emphasizes the need to start immediately, irrespective of the time. 01:26:20 David Goggins emphasizes the sacrifices he makes for success, including lack of sleep and unconventional lifestyle choices, driven by his determination to maintain his inner strength. 01:26:50 David Goggins discusses the challenge of balancing discipline in relationships, highlighting the tension between personal goals and the needs of loved ones. He emphasizes the importance of clear communication about individual priorities. 01:31:28 Goggins reflects on past mistakes of compromising himself to please others, emphasizing the importance of being true to oneself and not sacrificing personal fulfillment for the sake of relationships. 01:34:50 David Goggins encourages open and honest conversations in relationships, advocating for individuals to reveal their true selves to others. He highlights the power of authenticity and the liberation it brings. 01:36:14 Goggins shares his personal journey of self-discovery and overcoming societal expectations, encouraging individuals to embrace their true selves, even if it means defying conventional norms. 01:37:41 David Goggins emphasizes the significance of self-awareness and confronting one's insecurities and fears, asserting that embracing the truth is the starting line for a fulfilling and empowered life. 01:41:58 David Goggins rejects external dependencies for motivation and emphasizes the importance of the unseen work—personal struggles and triumphs—as the true source of internal motivation and strength. 01:46:15 David Goggins emphasizes the importance of internal strength and the misconception that people have about his life. 01:47:14 Goggins discusses the capacity for everyone to build true confidence and the misunderstanding surrounding his approach. 01:48:37 The conversation shifts towards the process of building inner strength, focusing on actions and verbs rather than success. 01:53:49 The discussion touches on the frustration of being misunderstood, especially regarding Goggins' use of intense language, which he explains comes from a place of realness. 02:00:26 Goggins explains his approach to relationships, both with close ones and the general public, maintaining a boundary to preserve his ability to continue self-improvement. 02:04:10 Goggins describes his perspective on capped success, prioritizing continued self-improvement over financial success and recognizing the perishable nature of his unique willpower. 02:07:32 The conversation explores the perishable nature of the willpower Goggins possesses, emphasizing the importance of turning the mind's manifestations into concrete actions for lasting growth. 02:10:21 Daily actions are pre-planned, akin to an artist creating a masterpiece. Spending time alone without distractions allows the mind to reveal the next steps. Passion and determination stem from understanding oneself, not external influences. 02:15:37 Mastery of internal dialogue involves a two-way conversation, acknowledging both positive and negative voices. The symphony of voices within oneself determines the actions taken, leading to real-world outcomes. 02:20:02 Prioritizing learning how to fail is essential for eventual success. Acknowledging failures, enduring hardships, and practicing perseverance lay the foundation for achieving long-term goals. 02:25:47 The unconscious mind, the supercomputer, controls most aspects of behavior. Going inward involves confronting the deep, dark aspects of oneself, cleaning the internal ""cupboards,"" and deliberate decision-making for meaningful actions. 02:30:30 Facing and embracing the hardships of the ""dungeon,"" the uncomfortable and scary place in our minds, is crucial for growth. Confronting and cleaning out our deepest fears is essential to becoming the person we're meant to be. 02:32:54 Life is a continuous test, and challenges arise when we least expect them. Going inward, acknowledging flaws, and actively working on self-improvement are vital to passing life's tests and fulfilling our purpose. 02:34:46 David Goggins emphasizes the importance of authenticity and brutal honesty in personal growth. Sharing one's struggles and vulnerabilities not only aids personal development but also inspires others to confront their own challenges. 02:35:45 Andrew Huberman expresses gratitude for David Goggins' openness and authenticity. Goggins' willingness to share his journey lights the path for others, encouraging them to face their challenges and strive for personal growth.",1년 전(수정됨),41,

@beatoy2807,"Until today I had never heard of David Googins. THANK YOU FOR HAVING HIM ON THE SHOW!!!  For the first time since 2017 I FEEL LESS ALONE.   I spent the majority of 46 years of my life extremely morbidly obese. I hated myself beyond measure. I cannot describe the amount of self hatred I was filled with.   In 2017 I had an ahhhh ha moment. God and I had a conversation. He told me that I was going to take every scrap, every ounce, every piece of stubbornness that I possessed and I was going to use it to get healthier.    I have been 400 pounds SEVERAL TIMES. List 100 pounds once. Gained every ounce back.   Since 2017 I Annihilated, destroyed, drowned, got rid of over 200 pounds. I am 5’1. I have so much loose skin. Do not care. In October of 2020 I got freaking Guillian Barre Syndrome. Asshole sickness I ended up significantly paralyzed for a time. I gained back maybe 30 pounds as a result. I started listening to you, Dr. Huberman in 2021.   Somehow my stubbornness kicked into freaking overdrive and in 2022 I made a freaking decision to stop eating 91%(my own made up number) of all sweeteners OF ANY KIND. I eat actual fresh whole fruits. But I do not eat honey, fake sugars, real sugars or any “healthy” sugar substitute. Freaking a man every day I wake up and all I can think is that holy shit I am NOT GOING TO EAT SUGAR TODAY. WHO THE HECK AM I?? I am now questioning God every day because I used CRAPPY for MY body food as Amy biggest source of comfort until I was 46.   Now I AM the person WHO WILL EAT A WHOLE HEAD OF LETTUCE if I feel I need to use food as a source of comfort.    I am tired of people talk about freaking moderation because I finally realized I do moderfreakingrate. I moderate my FOOD CHOICES. Other moderate their PORTION SIZE👍👍. We both moderate. Just differently and we have different results.    What you said your friend said about the cure for addiction I love love that completely.

@thegemologist9574,"I have the same problem with ADHD - I had great success by first creating a META framework structured by Purpose X Solution = Utility to learn better. I came to the realization that everything must have a purpose. The purpose defines the solution and ADHD people are generally performance oriented. The usefulness of the information MUST be specific.  Once the utility for my brain has been clearly defined, the brain begins to connect the information on a meta level. Everything goes faster. It's like running.  I learned that ADHD is a new generation brain. THE INFORMATION IS NOT STRUCTURED ENOUGH FOR ADHD. PROCEDURAL IS A “PAIN” FOR ADHD.  ADHD IS LIKE A QUANTUM OF BRAIN. THE LEARNING METHOD IS CENTRAL! META IS KEY. ELON MUSK ALSO MAY ALSO HAVE ADHD. IT'S THE FRAMEWORK WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT. I WAS IDENTIFIED WITH ADHD WHEN I WAS 5 YEARS OLD.  When I was a child, 10 to 20 mg of Ritalin in the morning improved my concentration - I was a little calmer mentally.",1년 전,0,

@cactuslover5,"I have been following Goggins for a long time. After this program, my opinion became clearer. Goggins cannot let go. That discovery of the mid cortex touched upon an interesting point in terms of explaining the will, but I do not think that human thoughts are greatly affected by only one factor. This is the product of a collective brain structure. David's Regarding the issue, David has internalized the troubles he has experienced and fixed his awareness so much that there is no turning back for him. At the same time, the character and personality of a 40-year-old person who has done this job at a very late age, which is considered very rare, now reaches an unshakable stability, not like the age between 15 and 23. That's why This is a life mentality specific to Goggins personally, but of course, their alternating ways may appeal to us. Another issue I wonder about is the mid cortex. I know from my own experience that if I were to actually do something that I had never wanted to do before and had never done before, If I decide, I will do it. I don't think it depends on the size or smallness of that cortex.",1년 전,1,

@MaitreSpader,"Two G's, exceptional podcast, thanks for the work Doc ! Though it may sound polarizing but I think right now they is another guy to consider in the picture of hard work, discipline, overcoming etc.. Is Andrew Tate. Just his take on those particular aspects is extremely powerful and they somewhat are quite alike, Tate and Goggins (pro fighter, army vet, both starting from rock bottom, both working nonstop, both having this ""angry"" vibe, etc...). Once again, I'm only talking of the ""hard work mindset"" part, to summarize. I'm pretty certain Goggins couldn't give a damn about Tate, but I think attempting to grab Tate for a podcast on the topic could be very powerful, because he is most definitely as powerful and abrasive in his delivery as Goggins but is also way more intellectual, so he could bring even more stuff into the equation on the topic. Tate's canceled so obviously can't bring him up on your pod (I mean he's still not allowed to leave Romania).

Interesting but I  don't particularly hearing fuck this fuck that, fucking sucks.....and so on. If cussing like he does works for him so be it. What that demonstrates to me is that he has little respect for others who may find that kind of talk offensive. One can express themselves just as passionately without being such a fuck mouth. I was a weak skinny 130 pound 5'9"" dude when I graduated from highschool. I did not excel at sports but did play decent trumpet and could run for miles in the desert, not for competition, just for me.

@kimberlyauinbauh8007,"Thank you Dr. Huberman for you podcast and to David Goggins for sharing his life full of purpose. I believe that everyone’s life should be personal to their lives and purpose and goals. Dr. Huberman, I have a question about your thoughts from your highly motivated life of purpose plus you are clearly connected to many people and it takes time and effort to maintain those relationships. You also appear to have a variety of wellness practices. You talk about sleep, you talk about exercise and getting sunlight. My question has to do with time. How are you choosing to balance these things and do you really think that happiness is less admirable than pursuing a goal? I hope il not sounding defensive but years ago I didn’t have peace, I was highly motivated and tried very hard toward school and then professional goals which cost me lots of things I wish I had back now, 20 years later. I gained weight due to lack of sleep, chronic stress and accidentally over eating. I tried to make my marriage work in the off hours. I don’t care to try to be extraordinary now other than I want to be living and caring. My purpose is not trying to build a career. I’m not struggling against sticky body hating it every day. I don’t think I know more but I do believe my life is better with balance. I’m happy to get 8 hours of sleep. I am happy to make time to eat healthy food. I’m curious how you balance this. I’m not upset about normal anymore. I want to maximize my 9-10 hours of work and I want to focus on my family. I hope to get another chance of partnership and I’m going to focus on it kids than 2-3 hours a day. I’m curious how YOU combine David Goggins thoughts with the work Arther Brooks has done or your excellent podcast recently with Adam Grant. Again, I’m very inspired by David Goggins and am grateful for his example and I fully agree that the only thing that builds greatness or purpose is hard work and dedication. I just don’t want a life with one thing - I don’t want to feel like I’ve wasted my time and my life. This is why I love your podcast. I want to maximize my life, I just want more than work or pursuit of a single goal. And I don’t want to have my family or a prospective partner have to fit into my life. I’d like to have time to invest in others and that only comes by forgoing something because like you said on the podcast, there isn’t enough time to do it all. And maybe for you your passion and purpose is your work. I think it’s totally reasonable for people to be ok without being extraordinary because of the time cost. It’s ok to have the time to give casual I tera too a time. It’s ok to stop and chat with the older person in the checkout. It’s ok to leave work to go to little league or get home in time to make a healthy dinner. I feel like I may be sounding defensive, but I really am curious your thoughts on balancing and trying to do it all. Thank you!!",1년 전,0,

This is such a great start to the year and I just want to say thank you both (and Jennifer) for allowing this to happen, and allowing us all to have a clearer look at the inner strength of something we all take as an inspiration.

@MadisonlovesJesus777,"Hey, I just want to say that God loves you so much 💕He loves you so much that He sent His Son, Jesus, who is One with Him from heaven to earth to save you. Jesus lived a perfect life with no sin in your place for you 🩷 He suffered and was treated like a criminal to pay the penalty of our sin, He died to pay our debt. He rose again to life on the third day! Anyone who repents (realizes they are a sinner in need of a savior, leading to turning away from sin and to Jesus) and they place their faith in Jesus, they will be reborn, they will be saved. 🩷 Romans 10:9 in the Bible says “If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.” Sadly those who haven’t placed their faith in Jesus will go to hell for their sins. God wants us to come to Jesus to be cleansed and made new, through faith in Jesus we will be given eternal life in heaven 💕 The Bible is Gods word; the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are the gospels of Jesus in the Bible, read them if you want to know more about Jesus’s words and His love. God bless you! 🫶🫶 Psalm 46:1-3 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.

Confidence and Belief - you have to build them every day 4. It's very empowering when you're an open book 5. You're the lab rat, but you're also the scientist   - Spend more time internally, thinking about life and death and what you want out of this life.  - Shut off social media and distractions like music, to build that inner + winner voice, that fights the loser voice in your internal dialogues. This also helps you find the list of what to do and achieve. - Internal, then ACTION  Good luck fellas",1년 전,0,

Learn the whole concept and dissect the concept to understand it more precisely. * There is No PASSION, HAPPINESS, or MOTIVATION in doing things. Life Sucks. JUST DO IT!  * People know what to do but the friction in doing sums up Laziness * Anterior-mid singular cortex - Part of the brain that gets bigger as you do the resistive & challenging things. But it shrinks if you don't do so! * There is No LIFE-HACK. Just do it!! Don't overthink. DO IT!! * Self Inspire & Self Motivate yourself, don't try to please people! * Don't get comfy. STAY HARD!  * When you start doing something tough, an inner negative voice comes and shouts at you to stop & relax and rest. Do listen to it, instead, develop another voice that inspires you! * 2 important things -1) Go Inward (Internal Dialogue) 2) Action (DO it) * Unconscious Mind -> Supercomputer of ourselves. Go inward and explore it!!  STAY HARD!  JUST DO IT!",1년 전,0,

It is still very remarkable and eye-opening, yet when you watch the guy talking - the shit he’s been through and the place where all of this is coming is so visible that you are literally consumed by this and you simply get it right away - everything Goggins is saying - is a fact.",1년 전(수정됨),3,

He also openly admits to having a black hole of shame, this ""other David"" that he fights every day.

@forgetaboutit123,"In the introduction they forgot this "" the retired Navy SEAL chief is believed to be the only member of the armed forces to complete the Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/s) course (including going through Hell Week three times), U.S. Army Ranger School (where he graduated as honor man), and Air Force tactical air controller training."" ""Because of injuries, Goggins had to restart BUD/S, including “Hell Week,” two more times before finally graduating with Class 235 in 2001. He was the 36th African-American man to become a Navy SEAL.""""By 2005, Goggins had put much of his weight back on from powerlifting. That all changed, again, in June 2005 when 19 service members, including many of Goggins’ friends, were killed during Operation Red Wings. (See sidebar.)  In their honor, Goggins wanted to raise money for the Special Operations Warrior Foundation, an organization that provides scholarships and counseling for children of fallen special operators. The only way he knew how to do that was by making himself “uncomfortable.”  “I Google searched the 10 hardest events in the world,” Goggins said. “And what came up was a race called the Badwater 135.”  At the time, Goggins said he didn’t know anything about the “ultra world.” He thought the Badwater Ultramarathon, a 135-mile race from California’s Death Valley to Mount Whitney, was a stage race where participants ran 135 miles over a few days — not 48 hours. To participate, athletes must have completed at least one ultramarathon.   “I called the [Badwater] race director on a Wednesday and participated in the San Diego One Day that Saturday,” Goggins said. “He said if I could complete it in 24 hours, I was in.”  The San Diego One Day is a 100-mile ultramarathon. Goggins said, at the time, he had never even run a marathon. He said he was confident that his mind would let him finish the race, but he didn’t know how bad his body would “get destroyed.” During the 24-hour race, Goggins suffered broken metatarsals in both feet and shin splints. He said he was urinating blood at mile 70.   “I also shit on myself twice,” Goggins said. “It was a bad day.”  However, Goggins persevered and finished the race in about 19 hours.""",1년 전,1,

Because there would be a things that people gonna take risk to do but they dont want to do, so if we cant trick our mind that turn the things that we things easy but to train the brain area to make it things that dont wanna do, that would be really dangerous way to make the brain part of will power, and is there any relationship with the flowstate?

@Apathetic_Angel,"Every day, I struggle. I know discipline is the key to freedom. I know discipline is the one choice i need to make in order to change myself and my life. My inner dialog is a battle that saps me of energy. My voice of reason in my head is relentless. I know better. I know what i need to do, but I fail at maintaining discipline. I lose track of my goals. I can't stay dedicated. I suffer because I know better and can't live up to my own standard of being. Every day is a battle of will I feel I continuously lose. I do not have sympathy for myself because it is weak and I can't afford it. Not when I am as low as I am. I can not justify my own weakness to myself. I can not give in to pity. Most days, I feel I wake up and go to war. A war between my external lifestyle and my internal truth. I do not know how to let my voice of reason win, to let discipline win. I do not know how to grow.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

I am very much like him, talking badly about myself to myself and motivating myself by feeling to little or to bad and then trying to overcome that by going to extreme discipline and forcing myself to do stuff. In therapy I now learned how to treat myself nicely and keep that edge. He seems so harsh to himself and pushed by the need to proof himself. I would like to challenge the seemingly obvious belief of Goggings that he needs that ruthlessness to keep being himself.",1년 전(수정됨),3,

@tiptapkey,"This podcast put into words something I've been grappling with for a while. Everywhere we look we see ""stop being so hard on yourself."" I went to therapy because I felt overweight, lazy, depressed, and directionless. The therapist said look at your life, you have a good job, a house, you have so many good things, so stop being hard on yourself, treat yourself, be kind to yourself, blah blah blah. Work to silence this part of yourself, and you'll be happy. No friction needed. So I stopped being hard on myself, stopped criticizing myself, I started following my base wants and desires. At first I had a little bit of positive feelings, but in the long run, I've turned into an even more overweight, lazy, depressed, directionless lump. I stopped thinking about myself and my life, stopped pushing myself. It's like I dissociated into a mildly pleasant frictionless life. I have no purpose, no meaning, no goals, no anything but go to work, eat the easiest meals, watch TV, look at my phone, and waste my money on junk. I'm sure my capitalist society loves me for it--thinks I'm perfect just like this--but I hate it. I hate myself and the life I've created. All in the spirit of not being hard on myself. All in the spirit of ""give yourself some grace,"" as my therapist loved to put it. I'm not a piece of shit, but I sure have been acting like one, and I'm done.",1년 전(수정됨),144,

@os2958,Wow that's so insightful!. I think there's some important nuances. Perhaps we do need to be hard on ourselves but in an inspiring positive way using constructive criticism. We can acknowledge that we are overweight but also commit to doing the hard stuff to get healthy. But we don't want to sit around just talking negative about ourselves. At 67 I have just realized that yeah therapy doesn't work to push people to make the changes they need to make. I guess we have the most power to do that with ourselves.

@Doublehelix354,"Yes there's a nuance here, we we can't talk negatively to ourselves all the time--we'd feel like we don't deserve anything, I haven't listened to the interview yet I like to preview the comments first, but I have heard Mr. Goggins speak before and I think he's missing one thing, &many of us are missing the fact is none of us chose the circumstances that we have to deal with each of us each of us have unique challenges and it seems that nobody else can understand our perspective!  No matter how many therapists are friends or family or spouses we try we sometimes have nowhere to go for help. I believe we were created by God and have our purpose in him and if we seek that purpose no matter how difficult and sucky it may be then at the end of our life we can say we ran the race we fought the fight, we did what we had to do with what we were given, and know that we lived our purpose.  I like to remember and meditate upon what others have done, how about Joseph who is sold into slavery and hated by his brothers, suffered further in that date yet God revealed his purpose many many years later.  I like to remember and think about people's lives not only from the Bible but those men and women that lived out their purpose you can see them everywhere they're on the news, they are in our history books.  And I thank you YouTube for bringing us these two find examples of men who are trying to make this world a better place, trying to lift others up turn the best of their ability, very very fine examples.  I had a boss once who would give us this advice after mistakes were made, she would simply say what is the lesson learned.  And so we would take that forward and that's what we can all do today and every day because each day we are one day closer do either heaven or hell.  And to those who say they don't believe what evidence do you have that is not true, I can't find any.  I do have have the desire to live forever with those I love who have passed on before me.  That is the promise of the Bible, of which is the backbone of this message.  Thank you again gentlemen and YouTube for providing this helpful and encouraging discussion.",11개월 전,0,
@Morale_Booster,"Being gentle on yourself only works for people who have learned genuine self love. As long as you still hate yourself, you will treat yourself and your life poorly, and you'll need discipline to keep you pointed in the right direction",10개월 전,2,
@Forestwitch123," @Morale_Booster this is the reply I was looking for 👏👏 when you love yourself, you don’t need discipline to do the things you don’t want to do. You simply do them because it’s the loving thing to do for yourself. It’s the difference between “get up and go to the gym you fat, lazy POS” and “I really don’t want to go to the gym right now, but I told myself I would, and I honor my commitments to myself even if it feels hard. I deserve to follow through on the promises I make to myself and I want to treat myself with love and respect, so I am going to go and exercise”  The former NEVER works in the long term.

I just want to be able to adapt this mindset when I dont feel like doing anything and yet there is a million things to do!!! I love you and your journey,1년 전,2,
@Hoe_Rogan," @mitalgandecha3041  this is great to hear! I am a child of immigrants so it was a struggle trying to do all of this in a predominantly English speaking nation. I was learning how to speak English (thanks sesame Street) and going to speech classes, translating immigration papers to my family while also teaching them how to read in English, while helping my brother and helping with illegal under the table work. None of it was easy, and it's honestly refreshing hearing Goggins talk about it because I absolutely do feel crazy sometimes for how hard I am on myself because of where I came from. I felt crazy switching careers after dedicating a lot of time to college and HATING my career choice. I was actually happy in the service industry and around blue collar workers because they're real people. They know who they are, and there's nothing fake about them. It's refreshing to hear on a mainstream podcast about how valuable that is, because I was made to feel like a loser by college ""elites"" for being comfortable about that chaos. I've been told that I am hard to ""deal with"" because I do need my alone time. I need to decompress and my decompression is not in front of the t.v watching Netflix. My decompression is ""fuck this, I'm going to Tahoe and hiking until I puke"". Sorry to ramble on, but it's just nice to hear lol.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

Or is it like a skill learned? This area becomes larger? New brain cells are formed? New connections are formed? Over what period of time does this happen? Could this mean people with dementia or a stroke could also grow brain parts to recover? Does that part of the brain also grow if you have a stroke and things become difficult to do?

@HustlingFreedom,"00:00 🎙 David Goggins, a retired Navy SEAL and ultramarathon runner, discusses his journey from a challenging childhood to becoming a bestselling author and influential figure. 01:53 🧠 Goggins delves into his inner dialogue and the self-discipline needed for his accomplishments, offering a unique perspective on mindset and achieving goals. 03:19 🎙 While cursing is present, the discussion offers valuable insights into self-discipline, pushing boundaries, and embracing discomfort. 04:45 ☕ Goggins shares his intense study routine and approach to learning medical knowledge, emphasizing his disciplined regimen and commitment to mastery. 14:20 💡 Despite his difficulties, Goggins illustrates his dedication to deep learning and understanding in fields like medicine, demonstrating a remarkable transformation from his past struggles. 17:38 🛤 Goggins contrasts the distinct experiences of focus and suffering between his intense study sessions and rigorous physical training, highlighting the depth of his mental and physical dedication. 20:25 🌱 Friction equals growth, a principle deeply ingrained in David Goggins' philosophy, emphasizing the value of challenges in personal development. 21:23 🧠 Despite physical limitations and adversities, Goggins highlights the power of relentless effort, even during late hours, showcasing the depths of human potential. 22:50 🛡 Goggins is frustrated by the misunderstanding of the sacrifices and intensity required to achieve greatness, especially when judged by those unaware of the extreme dedication it demands. 28:59 🪞 Goggins emphasizes the haunting nature of his past, stating that transformation isn't permanent; it requires constant effort to combat the inner self he once was. 33:41 💪 Goggins promotes vulnerability and honesty, aiming to show the harsh realities of life's challenges, contrasting the glossy portrayals often seen on social media. 35:34 📚 Rejecting the notion of passion and motivation, Goggins advocates action and perseverance, challenging conventional ideas about success and effort. 37:59 🥕 Goggins operates without the allure of a reward or 'carrot,' relying solely on relentless effort and discipline, dismissing conventional motivation-driven narratives. 40:19 ⚙ His inner voice questions his capabilities, reminding him of past inadequacies, driving him to outwork his own self-doubt and limitations. 42:41 🏋 David Goggins highlights the shift from seeking external motivation (videos, music) to an internal drive cultivated through discipline and inspiration from iconic characters. 45:34 🚫 Goggins emphasizes the harsh reality of hard work, dispelling the misconception that it's glamorous or motivating like in movies or documentaries. 46:31 🧠 Neuroscientifically, the anterior mid-cingulate cortex, associated with willpower, grows when one consistently engages in challenging tasks they resist, not activities they enjoy. 49:51 🧠 Goggins emphasizes the continuous investment in doing what's hard, even daily, to maintain and grow willpower, drawing parallels to the renewal required in overcoming addiction. 54:41 🤔 Effort alone isn't enough; true growth comes from facing discomfort, the 'stick' and 'haunt,' terms signifying the critical, unpleasant elements necessary for enhancing willpower. 55:41 💡 The discovery of willpower, found in facing challenges repeatedly, enables individuals to unlock their potential and understand themselves profoundly, a journey many avoid due to its unattractive nature. 01:00:04 🏋‍♂ Willpower and growth stem from consistently doing things one doesn't want to do, creating a continuous journey of self-improvement and discovery, even when faced with discomfort. 01:03:52 🧠 Dopamine isn't just about pleasure; it responds to pain too. The anterior mid-cingulate cortex triggers dopamine release in response to challenges, a learned response with neuroplasticity. 01:04:47 🔄 Neuroplasticity works both ways: it can grow but also shrink, requiring constant maintenance—an often overlooked aspect of brain adaptability. 01:05:44 🌱 The brain's adaptability is exemplified by David Goggins, showcasing the growth of the anterior mid-cingulate cortex due to relentless practice and determination. 01:06:36 🧩 Describing the internal drive behind immense personal growth, Goggins emphasizes that explaining the process is easy, but executing the required daily grind is the real challenge. 01:11:44 🚫 Goggins challenges the ""excuses"" mindset, highlighting that change requires an internal flame; external motivation won't suffice. 01:13:31 🌟 He reinforces that change is an internal battle; individuals must awaken their determination. No external force can provide the willpower needed for transformation. 01:20:36 🕒 Goggins emphasizes the importance of starting without delay, advocating against setting specific start times due to the danger of procrastination and lost opportunities. 01:21:32 💪 Overcoming challenges and building expertise often requires repetitive, hard work—a lesson learned and exemplified by Goggins' life journey. 01:23:58 🛌 David Goggins acknowledges the importance of sleep, nutrition, and recovery but highlights that to achieve something significant, sometimes sacrifices need to be made in these areas. He prioritized building confidence over certain aspects of self-care. 01:29:39 💔 Goggins maintains an unbalanced focus on family but ensures they have everything they need to allow him the necessary space and dedication for his pursuits without interference. 01:39:34 🏋‍♂ Goggins highlights the difference between seeking external validation and deriving motivation from personal achievements. He credits his relentless self-training for enabling him to extract motivation from within, independent of external praise or recognition. 01:44:23 🧠 Goggins stresses the importance of building one's internal strength, referencing a personal ""medicine cabinet"" of mental resilience developed through overcoming obstacles. 01:46:45 🔍 He discusses the misconception around his persona, highlighting that his approach isn't just about pushing forward relentlessly but also about confronting fears and maintaining a high level of discomfort. 01:48:37 🔄 Goggins advocates for a process-oriented approach to personal growth, emphasizing action over success and the significance of maintaining friction and internal resilience. 01:51:55 💬 He delves into the internal struggle, sharing his personal battles between self-doubt and determination, offering insights into the mental battles he fights to maintain resilience and personal growth. 01:59:57 🤝 Goggins sets boundaries to maintain personal growth, indicating the necessity of prioritizing self-improvement without allowing external pressures or opinions to hinder his journey. 02:03:42 🧠 David Goggins emphasizes the concept of capped success, highlighting the danger of overextending oneself and losing the raw willpower cultivated over a lifetime. 02:04:39 🗣 Authenticity is pivotal to Goggins. He finds immense value in being honest and genuine, feeling the power in true, earned conversations. 02:05:36 🚫 Goggins fears losing his hard-earned willpower, recognizing it as a perishable skill that requires consistent dedication to maintain and grow. 02:07:32 🧭 The process of going inward and taking actions is vital, drawing parallels to historical figures who found strength and resilience through inner reflections. 02:10:21 🎨 Goggins likens his daily routine to painting a masterpiece of himself, highlighting the importance of creating and shaping oneself without distractions. 02:14:16 🌟 Goggins emphasizes the individuality of one's path, urging individuals to discover themselves to find answers and unleash their potential. 02:20:31 💪 Mastery of failure is a critical step for Goggins, who believes it's the foundation for eventual success, emphasizing the importance of embracing failure to reach victory. 02:21:59 🗣 Goggins explains the complexity of inner dialogue, highlighting the need for years of dedicated self-reflection to filter out the conflicting voices and pursue one's chosen path. 02:24:49 🧠 Understanding the unconscious mind is crucial; it often drives our actions without us realizing it. Exploring it through introspection can be challenging but enlightening. 02:26:16 🚪 Digging into your unconscious is like examining dusty cupboards; it's frightening, revealing hidden fears and struggles, but essential for growth. 02:29:05 💪 Cleaning those dark corners of your mind daily, facing your demons, is the true path to self-improvement; it's about relentless introspection and action. 02:34:16 🛣 The journey inward is daunting, but it's where real change happens; opening up those cupboards, however painful, is necessary for understanding oneself and passing life's tests.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

He’s advising people on similar principles, and as someone who is recovering from his own disconnection to his body, I can’t agree with his methodology.  I think a lot of his current idea of himself has to do with that Trauma, and I think “everything has to be focus” is his way of distracting himself from his Trauma, and the feelings therein.  In my journey I have tested and challenged myself in ways that have proven how strong and capable I am, through focus, but ALSO through appropriate rest and recuperation.",1년 전,1,

Consistent effort and upkeep are required to maintain its positive development. 01:06:36 😓 David Goggins reflects on the difficulty of explaining his achievements, emphasizing the challenge lies in the daily practice rather than just understanding the concept. 01:10:48 🔄 People often attribute past success to external conditions, but Andrew Huberman and David Goggins stress the importance of recognizing personal agency and capabilities in the present. 01:17:18 💡 David Goggins emphasizes the internal awakening required for personal transformation, stressing that individuals already know what to do, and the switch can be flipped by self-recognition and determination. 01:23:58 🌌 David Goggins emphasizes the importance of prioritizing and sacrificing certain aspects like sleep, nutrition, and recovery to achieve specific goals and build confidence. 01:25:24 🛤️ Goggins shares his personal journey of overcoming challenges, including stuttering, insecurity, and immaturity, highlighting the necessity of forsaking certain comforts to gain confidence. 01:29:39 🤝 Goggins discusses balancing relationships and personal goals, emphasizing clear communication about one's priorities and expectations upfront to avoid conflicts and maintain focus. 01:31:28 💔 Goggins reflects on past mistakes of compromising himself to please others, stressing the importance of being true to oneself, setting clear boundaries, and not compromising personal values for external validation. 01:36:42 🧠 Goggins advocates for embracing vulnerability and honesty, asserting that acknowledging one's flaws and being transparent about them is the starting line to living an authentic and empowered life. 01:41:30 🚀 David Goggins finds immense inner strength by training alone, pushing himself to levels of passion and purpose without external motivation. 01:42:28 🔥 The power of unseen work: Goggins emphasizes the importance of self-motivation and building inner strength through personal challenges without needing external validation. 01:44:23 💊 Goggins' medicine cabinet metaphor: Overcoming obstacles and challenges is like building a mental medicine cabinet, and the real power lies within oneself, not in external supplements or pre-workouts. 01:45:21 🧠 The mind as the most powerful weapon: Goggins highlights the significance of understanding and training the mind, feeding it the right mental nutrients to become unstoppable. 01:51:55 🔄 The process of finding oneself: Goggins discusses the importance of winning internal battles, creating a winning voice, and overcoming self-doubt to build true confidence and avoid feeling lost. 02:03:42 🛑 David Goggins emphasizes the concept of ""capped success,"" explaining that continuously pursuing financial success without challenging himself physically and mentally leads to a loss of willpower and personal growth. 02:04:10 🧠 Goggins values his extraordinary willpower as a perishable skill and credits it with allowing him to have genuine, honest conversations with others, free from deception and personal conflict. 02:05:08 👁️ Goggins highlights the profound satisfaction of looking another person in the eye and knowing that everything he says is genuine and earned, emphasizing the importance of authenticity in human interactions. 02:06:32 🎨 Goggins compares his daily routine to painting a masterpiece, emphasizing the need to spend dedicated time with oneself, free from distractions, to discover individual paths and maintain passion, drive, and determination. 02:15:37 🗣️ Goggins discusses the significance of mastering internal dialogue, distinguishing between multiple voices within oneself, and the importance of learning how to fail properly before achieving success. 02:23:51 🎙️ Goggins emphasizes the importance of self-belief, courage, dedication, and a resilient mindset for achieving success despite external skepticism. 02:25:17 🧠 Psychiatrist Paul Conti suggests the unconscious mind, not the forebrain, is the brain's supercomputer, controlling most actions. Goggins advocates introspection to understand and control this aspect. 02:28:10 🚪 Goggins metaphorically refers to the ""dark cupboards"" of one's mind, representing deep, painful experiences and fears. Regularly confronting and cleaning these is crucial for personal growth and success. 02:29:33 💪 Goggins challenges individuals to open their own ""cabinets,"" confront past traumas, and engage in deep introspection regularly to overcome challenges and grow. 02:32:54 🔄 Goggins views life as a continuous test, emphasizing the need to constantly confront personal challenges. He encourages people to embrace difficulties, as they shape one's true self.",1년 전,113,

If you believe and repent of your sins and put your faith and trust in Him as you would a parachute jumping off a plane at 25000 feet up in the air, He will give you eternal life in heaven as a free gift and I promise you, He will change your life forever as He did mine. He is the ONLY way to heaven and He loves you all. Please think deeply about this with urgency because this is your eternal life and soul, you don’t know when you could die, meaning you could die at any moment, so please consider this with all your heart. If anyone tells you that Jesus isn’t the only way, they are lying to you and they don’t care about your future.",1년 전,0,
