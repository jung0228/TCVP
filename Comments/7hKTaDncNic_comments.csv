@Digitalhunny,"I'm an Interior Decorator & a Mother. Both of these parts of me are screaming: ""Please anchor that floor length mirror!!"" It's by a door & can be extremely dangerous if it falls. How do you anchor a floor length mirror that leans?? By screwing picture wire to the back of the mirror's frame & than screws into the wall like you did for the other heavy mirror. This just ensures that it stays put. The wire is large enough to still get that leaning on the wall look. Please ask me directly & I'll walk you through it if necessary. Remember the First rule of Design is: ""Form follows function"". This means use & safety, before looks & style!! What the point of beautiful if it KILLS you?? Stay safe & happy 🤗🥂 ps. you can 100% switch the refrigerator & freezer doors to open the opposite way!! All new fridges do it & yours is new.

@dianebrown4559,"Adorable Ashley, hello from Granny Diane. Love your apt. You will always need a drill. Do you know what is wrong with wallpaper? Answer: Absolutely nothing. Gold mirrors are the 'bomb' (an expression from the 80's I think) & they are a good thing ala Martha Stewart. That badly placed mirror next to the clothing rack is not a good thing because a badly placed mirror sucks; better for us to see what's behind it & you can repaint whatever it is. You have great ""taste"" & are very chic. The Dollar Tree stores have the best larger $1.00 bowls ever. Mine is a few yrs. old but is a beautiful red one, perfect to toss salads in & eat salads out of. Your plant hangers are stunning as are your plants. You seem to know some Latin . . . excellent . . . & are smart enough to realize the importance of clothes hampers fitting where they go. Fridge doors can usually be reversed; look at the top of the door to see if there is a lynch pin, etc. Your apt. have a handyman? Back to that over-sized mirror . . . get to Ikea or a discount store & get one of those inexpensive skinny mirrors that we hide on the back of bedroom doors to use for that awkward spot & then take it from there. Lovely chatting with you darling girl. I'm reminded of my two granddaughters who are a bit younger but a great girl is always a great girl. Good talk. Hopefully will talk again soon. (Oops.

These ones come off better, but sometimes, depending on how humid the room is, a little bit of the underside may stay on the wall.

First hus mom became ill and he spent lots of time caring for her and she eventually passed away. About the time she passed away I was moving out of my condo of 20 yrs which I greatly loved. Wish I had a cell phone with the internet back than as it was an awesome dwelling known as the largest one bedroom complex in all of Northern VA. I had 2 walk in closets. I wish one would have been as big as your bedroom because I would have made a sewing room. My mom has terminal cancer now and it's been a shock especially since she walks close to a mile even in 40 degree weather. She first smoke she doesn't drink has been a servent of Christ for years is very active in her church and why is she sick and the 28 year old snot st work who bulleys me to no end lights a cig with a cig and comes to work drunk most days does not have terminal cancer.  I wiuld have liked to know what your rent was and what line of business you were in and what do you like yo sew. I use to live in San Mateo, Calif. I now live in Arlington, VA. My condo was 8 min from historic old town.  I have been working at a car dealership since 2005 I am the only female in my apartment. I am in charge of field disposal. We will throw sometimes $25,000 of parts away in dumpsters. I keep all the silver and copper engine oil washers because I make jewerly with them. I keep large metal rings thinking someday making something with them.   I love refinishing furniture and I have many antiques. Somewhere packed in a box I have my bottle collection.  Well, it is almost 1am and 6am will come quick. I wish I was young again like you I would try to be more hip.

The bookcases had one vertical shelf in the corner which supported the entire thing. It was pressure mounted no screws. You didn't notice unless you looked up. I bought nice baskets for the shelves.   He built a queen size bunk bed in the closet. I monted a curtain rod on the ceiling and hung linen curtains. The space was very intimate and cozy.   Under the corner of the clostet window,  he built a desk and an open cabinet above it. I stained them to match the trim on the woodwork.   We spent 3 yrs there. When we moved out, the manager asked if we would leave the built-in bookcases and desk in place.  We left them and 10 yrs later, they are still there.

Her babies will grow out again and this time with much better soil than the mother plant. I have a maidenhair angel fern named 'Diva' cause she is one; high maintenance.

Thanks for everything you've made over the past 4 years or so. You motivate me to pick up my room. Among many other things. I don't have the ambition or desire for extreme interior design, or sewing, or video making, or makeup, even fashion much anymore,  but I love how you inspire me to do things as simple as, for example, be proud of myself for keeping a journal for the past six or seven years. It feels weird to type this shit in a YouTube comment but, in many ways, you are a balance to how I feel I am. You're good at a lot of the working-type of stuff that I really slack on,  and I'm better at giving myself a break. In your recent videos this year (2020), I've really been amazed to see how much you've grown up.   I'm a couple years younger than you are but you went through college and everything at a pretty accelerated rate, and so you really are someone that so many of your followers can see as both an experienced grownass woman and a fellow peer just trying to make it in the world.

After all was said and done, your video was not worth the time you spent to make it, and it certainly was not worth my time.  Boasting and bragging about having sex with whoever is not cool; too many young people have STDs, are HIV-Positive, and many may not have a future because they thought it was cool, too, to be so promiscuous.

@claudiamandini,"Reallyyyyyy!!!! I got inspired giving some ideas for you to evaluate and you’re already moving?!?!?! Hugh!!!! Winnnnnn!🤪🤨😓 Well! Then good luck in New York! You’re becoming kind of a bohemian kind of a person! Take care of your down there health!!! Ir seems you’re  Kind of easy sharing your feelings! Get serious with that! Every time you get “that” attached to the body of another human being, your soul catches some of the other persons history. It could be not as convenient. It’s better to keep that sharing to be shared just for deep feelings! Remember our Lord’s advices and teachings! Best of wishes, sorry I’m talking kind of momma style, it’s possible! Sorry God bless you! I’m already checking if you already are installed in the big apple! Blessings!",4년 전,0,
@claudiamandini,"@bestdressed Ashley, have you thought of mounting high your bed in your room/walk in closet? You could get up by some stairs installed in the door from the bathroom. The height would be given by how is you measure when seated in the mattress. Then you Could use that huge space underneath to your Clothing! Imagine! You could end having a Luxurious Princess Walk In Closet, with your fluffy white carpet so you just crawl in, and hang you things all around! I think you would be soooo happy happy!!!! ❤️  Then! If I were you I would search for a nutty bent tree branch, have it painted with Gold Spray paint. I’d hang it to the wall behind your classic Chairs and then, you can design some leaves falling, painted kind of from a lateral perspective, paint them also in Gold, but adding them some shades of copper and silver, and it would look sooo Classy!  Last! I would turn around your $1 awesome desk, so it can be more the point of attention in that different ambience, you coul place your chair behind, and place a chic classic Lamp over, just in front of the entrance. It would look just so impressive!!!  I thank you sooo much for having shared your arrangements! I’ve enjoyed it as if I were You there!!!  And literally last! Since eclecticism is kind of THE style these days, consider painting the window frames, all together in let’s say turquoise framing them into an outer just colored line, kind of grouping them together. Then buy some rounded shape gardening store. Spray them too in turquoise, and place them just in front of the windows kind of making a down splash 15” deep and from a side to the other of the windows. They sell kind of a fledge or angle, you can fix with hot glue to keep the rocks in order. And finally you can paint the glass of the plants in colors ducha as purple, yellow and light neon green. It would give to your apartment such character! It would recreate a Bohemian style, mixed with the classic style of the Chairs and a Modern style in the Kitchen!  I am sorry if I let myself go above dreaming! You just look sooo happy!  Thanks again!!!",4년 전,0,

Super obsessed, probably partially because I am living vicariously through you (I am 26 and have moved from my parents place in Switzerland to London, last year, which was about the most exciting thing to happen to me lol) and then I just think you're an interesting person. I have noticed how openly you talk about sex and sexuality (and not as like dedicated content thing but just as a basic life thing that everyone does), like finding a condom wrapper and being casual abuout it (because who has never just found a random wrapper, when cleaning out their room) or admitting your horniness in quarantine (again, so normal). So to make a long ramble short: I like watching your content because in a way it normalises things other people might consider more taboo and would not talk about, even if they are a part of our lives but then at the same time you seem to live this fancy, exciting life, not every normal person gets to experience.",5년 전,0,

@loverlyme,"I love how long you took to do this. Believe me- my place is a continual work in progress. I know I have issues with making decisions too but in the end, all that 'thinking' goes into planning and I often come up with a better solution. And it doesn't matter if you did all that work just to move out a short time later. It's all part of the fun of decorating (and the learning curve that goes with this).  Can I just ask- are there three doors coming out of that closet?",5년 전,3,
@loverlyme,"Don't worry about the drill purchase. It will come in handy. I bought a cheap one for my first (and second) ones and it was well used. Finally I'm onto the cordless type (along with all my other Ryobi One+ skins)- only I now have 4 drills. One I use for screwing in the screws (so I don't have to change over from the drill parts continuously). One is a hammer drill (for concrete and brick and other hard surfaces). And there's two as regular drills. I'm usually working alongside someone so it's handy to have one each. I probably wouldn't have bought so many except they all came in a pack that I bought second-hand. I use the drill for so many things- you'd be surprised how you can use it. For example, scrubbing brushes have come about in the last couple of years that you attach to your drill to clean the bathroom. I sometimes attach a fluffy head to it to wax and polish my car (though you can get these to fit on various orbital sanders too). Why do something manually when you can break out a power tool?",5년 전,1,

So the lights go on I freak out because I’m afraid someone is in my house fucking with me. My boyfriend wakes up. I realise it’s all because of the video and calm down. He hates me now. I think.

@oliviaschaer7143,"i wrote this story that basically could become a movie. it is about this 49 year old man who has created the new years resolution to become more creatively involved. he has this this amazing, ideal, american dream life but is clearly lacking in happiness. it almost seems like you are missing something because it starts with a clip of him on new years eve then quickly switches to him moving through his everyday life and you think its just going to continue until something awful happens to ruin his perfect life. as we watch him every Monday for a month during January go through his everyday life with great detail we see him each Monday walking home even though his friends and wife offer to drive him home each day. he walks by a ground floor window everyday to see an extremely young girl(around 20-21)eating dinner with a different man every night. she is very average looking(not extremely beautiful like you Ashley)but he likes walking by the window so he can read her. because they have never had an interaction he speed walks past each time for only a millisecond, because he soon realizes that if she sees him staring he may seem like a peeping tom, pervert, pedophile, rapist etc, and make her uncomfortable. he begins to right a book made up of just the clips of when he sees her. he later realizes that he is only writing this book out of pity, or because he has needed something to look forward to everyday witch makes him realize how he doesn't appreciate every day like he thought he did but rather he pushed through each day just to see her. he waits until December before he looks at the book again. he wants to publish it but he wants her to know that the story is about her. he goes to her apartment building and finds her apartment number. he goes up to her door and knocks. she answers, dressed in dress pants a sweater and bare feet. he tries explaining his story in a way that doesn't make her uncomfortable. she explains that she needs to read the story first to see how she is portrayed. they agree that he will come back next Monday to hear her feedback and retrieve the book. that monday he forgets to retrieve the book and starts his walk home but as he walks past the ground floor window you see her reading the book and crying.",5년 전,0,

She’s not perfect but she shows people that it’s ok to make mistakes and go through breakups and be insecure because we are all human beings that will feel that way at some point. People enjoy her for that reason. She’s not perfect, nobody is, but she is strong, funny and independent and shows other young women that they can be too.",5년 전,2,

A mirror is an excellent solution to make the place look wider and bigger, So you have got all the right tools there, just change their spaces. probably create an impressive wall and then place a big mirror on the opposite side to a reflection of furniture and impression wall.

First of all, it's her friends in LA and people she hangs out with that are like that. Part of that is her fault because she is most likely subconsciously drawn to people like that only to find disappointment in them later. Another thing is I don't know where she's originally from but based on my life and experience as a 80's baby, LA has specific region that's very superficial. Keep in mind that when people refer to LA, they actually mean LA county. Which has more population than most states such as Michigan. Usually around northern part of LA (Hollywood) that attracts hipsters, hypebeasts and rich foreigners from Europe and East Asia have all these superficial and fake people.",5년 전,0,

Often people that talk about sex a lot are viewed as attention seekers or as if they have nothing better to do. I admit I think they are attention seekers too because it's not a common topic.

@cookiecreampie912,To get your pots and pans clean like new use a lemon cut in half and scrub like crazy with hot water and dish soap. You can cut little lines in the raw part of the lemon so it will eventually split while you scrub.,5년 전,0,
@lupusincidus,"Two things:  1) removing sticky labels -> mix baking soda with water as a paste and rub all over label. Let sit for couple minutes. Rub/peel label off with fingers with minimal effort! :D 2) I know glass takes more energy to melt down and like recycle in that way however if the world stopped relying on plastic as we do, we could go back to what society used to do - if people brought their glass drinks bottles etc back to a store they would get like a small reward (like 15pence, would likely be more now as inflation exists) and those glass bottles etc would then be washed so they're like new, and then refilled and sold again. This would happen over and over and over until they eventually had to melt them down and do something else with them! Another fun fact, when plastic was invented it was never intended to be used as it is today! It was meant to be only for things that really benefitted from it and definitely in small amounts. Not only that, but as plastic is made out of a non renewable resource where as glass is made of a renewable one, glass is totally still the superior environmentally friendly option :D  Bonus thing! Great video, really enjoyed it!",5년 전,10,

,"In a previous video you mentioned that you want to move out of LA because you feel lonely. I don't even live in the US but I can relate how even being surrounded by people and being busy can feel lonely. I got closer to my family and re-stablished contact with some old friends and helped me mitigate that. I know people moves around more in the US but you should think about doing something on this regard. You look like 5 or 10 years younger than me, so probably in your 20s. It's easy to make friends and meet people that can potentially be close friends. It will be way harder in your 30s so don't waster a lot of time thinking about money. Just pile it up enough, save for retirement and you're done with it.   Also, don't be stupid and drink the kool aid that having a bf/gf is for loosers or people that goes the beaten path. It's just bad advice. It's true that finding a compatible person is hard but I know many people who is single in their 40s and they look a bit depressed. Having a bf/gf is useful to cope when no one else is going to be close and to find emotional relief when you feel bad.   For some reason I needed to tell you this.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

Take the time off and ready your ass for the tiring process of moving, you’re gonna need it. I would just like to thank  you, for making my 2019 not as shitty thanks to your videos. Ever since I subscribed (this is gonna sound like bullshit but) I felt so much better about myself, I saw a difference and felt like I glowed up (which we shouldn’t expect on everyone, you’re all beautiful with or without one), I felt more confident with my fashion sense, I stepped out of my comfort zone and people actually appreciated my outfits. Thank you for helping me better, and more comfortable, and confident, and thanks for putting your time and effort to be able to make really good quality videos for your subscribers, we appreciate it, and we would also appreciate it if You know when you have to rest, do not waste your energy trying to feel better on putting up a video every week, especially if you aren’t feeling well. Hope that you’ll be happy in your new apartment soon, and that you’ll be happy living in your new home. We’re here to support you all the way through, and hope that the next year will not be as shitty! Sending lots of love to you and to everyone else that subscribed to this lovely human being!

@tatianaa77,"Hi Ashley, I know how you love to take the time to thank your subscribers, but I also kind of want to thank you, for making these videos. Before I found your videos I felt my life was bleak, repetitious, and mundane; to be more specific and sound a little less depressing- I had no hobbies or interest(other than my fluctuating interest in fashion), no social life(my life consisted of going from my house to work and back home from a job I did not like) or social skills, and I wasn't motivated to do anything more. But watching your videos and a couple others(I looked forward to yours the most, lol) I started to regain my interests and just started to want more; I wanted to go places, meet people, find a hobby(or two) and just being filled with so much positive emotion... it was great. And then stuff happened which kind of halted the inspiration that was budding in me(I only really managed to go to a park to read manga, lol). And now that I'm ready to make real changes in my life again, I'm glad that your still making videos that radiate life and positivity through the screen. Even when your just being sad and real about your struggles I'm like, ""it's okay Ashley things'll get better""... you know. Soo~ I kind of lost the point of this cuz' I've never written such a long ass post, but I just wanted to say thanks for makin' videos.   P.S.- I realized after writing this that it sounds really sad and depressing so I just wanted to clarify(in case you do actually get around to reading this); I do look up to you(even though you""re 2 years older than me) and I understand that you're a real person. And it's not like I'll off myself just because you stop making youtube videos(but don""t do that cuz' love your videos, lol). Anyway I seriously hope I haven""t creep you out with this post and wish you the best with your new move. I'm looking forward to seeing you make videos in the city that I'm in. Maybe if you do a meet up I might actually find the courage to go to one(or least feel happy knowing that I had the opportunity to go to one).

I'm a witch too so I keep a plant around. ¿So QuIrKy RiGhT? •She lives in nyc in an apartment with more than one room and y'all are like, ""oh so small~ :("" Go there and look at the people who live on the street with hallow faces and a thin jacket to fight off the biting cold. If I could afford anything there on my own I'd be grateful. Most of us don't literally flip a coin to decide where we live •Being by yourself isn't special either.  •God forbid women wanting to take care of themselves. Jesus. What a bunch of wannabes amirite? •Cursing isn't special.  •Ashley, taking a break and separating work from relaxing time is *fine*.

@therandomdot2563,"There's a company that's solved the mixed-plastics recycling problem by creating a massive processing machine that just breaks it all down to liquid plastics again. But, yeah, still very expensive. They have a prototype. The way it would be profitable is through economies of scale; if they break down enough plastics, then eventually the thing will pay for itself. But, massive initial investment by cities if they want to implement it. It's a catch-22 between glass and plastic. Glass is heavier to transport, especially to make containers to-spec so they won't be fragile in the super market. Plastic is lighter, but too many different grades, and needs special processing. Some companies are exploring biodegradeable food-grade packaging, because humans are just biologically wired to want to throw trash on the ground. So, just let packaging be biodegradeable and ""melt"". (eg: some are experimenting with corn papers and things that deteriorate quickly when wet.) Ideally, we would have folks buy their own containers, then just reuse / refill them.. but the FDA would never let that fly, as some folks wouldn't sanitize them well enough and we'd have outbreaks of food illness. anyways, TMI",5년 전,1,

@Digitalhunny,"I'm an Interior Decorator & a Mother. Both of these parts of me are screaming: ""Please anchor that floor length mirror!!"" It's by a door & can be extremely dangerous if it falls. How do you anchor a floor length mirror that leans?? By screwing picture wire to the back of the mirror's frame & than screws into the wall like you did for the other heavy mirror. This just ensures that it stays put. The wire is large enough to still get that leaning on the wall look. Please ask me directly & I'll walk you through it if necessary. Remember the First rule of Design is: ""Form follows function"". This means use & safety, before looks & style!! What the point of beautiful if it KILLS you?? Stay safe & happy 🤗🥂 ps. you can 100% switch the refrigerator & freezer doors to open the opposite way!! All new fridges do it & yours is new.

Fake security camera or real ones also helps. Wireless doorbell with camera works(pretty cheap these days). Motion sensor very bright led in front of the door. Have multiple silhouette cardboard cutout of a person. and put it at specific places where there is automatic light turn on through your phone press.

@sittingstill3578,Why does Ashly hate the elderly? Is it the self loathing combined with transference? I feel like she’s just going to shatter into a million pieces even though she seems fluid and mobile. It’s like everything is under such extreme stress. I’m looking forward to seeing her overcome these challenges and become fully comfortable in her skin.   I get the impression that her true energy level is way less than displayed in these videos. Her passion doesn’t require super high energy to communicate. Neither does it require 300 words a minute. This is who she is today and that’s ok but she needs to be at rest for her own physical and emotional health.,5년 전,2,

Over the past year of watching her I grew to respect her for what she’s passionate for, her determination to achieve her goals and overall how nice of a person she is. Not a lot of us out here who are her age or older have her hard working skills and discipline, so it’s really refreshing to see Ashley. Ashley, you may not think you’re a person to be admired this much, but in all honesty I cannot emphasize how much I’m motivated to see you be so independent and hardworking, and I’m sure many people out there are as well. So please don’t make too cruel self deprecating jokes, we love you for who you are and we’re sure that we’ve seen the true you in your videos.

As someone who was born and raised in LA, it’s very rare that I hear other people who were also born and raised here refer to LA’s inhabitants as superficial or lacking personality. It’s usually the LA transplants who come here from other states/cities who already have this preconceived notion of LA being fake, or think LA is just Hollywood, or have dreams of fulfilling their acting/cinematic careers only to be disappointed that usually have all this nasty stuff to say about LA. All that to say, you’ve only been living here in “LA” aka Westwood, which is only one part of this huge county, for what, 4-5 years? It’s extremely off putting that you so casually put down this city that you’re not even from, all before moving to another notoriously big, famous city of which I’m sure the people who were born and raised there would not appreciate another Out of stater moving to simply bc it’s New York and because moving there just seems cool and trendy (and cliché) like that",5년 전,2,

@unclechristine,idk if carpet beetles are the same things as bed bugs but here are my tips for bed bugs specifically!! (I’m sure it can apply to other buggies too)  1. check for grain-sized bits on the seams & edges of furniture: I never buy anything that has stains or dark spots (could be bug fecal matter ew)  2. give it a smell check & make sure it’s not stank lol   3. vacuum the furniture & cover it with plastic and set it outside in direct sunlight to kill anything  4. and then I’ll use Clorox wipes to wipe down any hard surfaces but maybe surface test to make sure it won’t damage certain woods,5년 전,25,

@kaidenleard6078,ok boomer,5년 전,0,
@ninanoir13artist,"Yes, to “Quarantine” the item there are a few ways you can do it, you’ll want to go to the store and buy Bed Beg killing cleaner, vacuum your furniture, spray your furniture, steam it, spray rubbing alcohol, tea tree oil and peppermint on the underside of ALL the furniture,do these steps a few times, then put paper bags full of salt, (like a cup in each paper lunch bag) just lay them all over the furniture and then wrap that furniture with Seran Wrap, covering EVERYTHING!!! Then yes leave the furniture outside or in a Garage, the longer the better. Trust you’ll know if your items had any hitchhikers after doing this! You’ll find carcasses and evidence. These pests are relentless, The eggs in both these pests can lay dormant for months, carpet beetles can be up to 2 years!! Just be careful ALWAYS inspect the furniture, any holes in wood or on fabric stay away from it! Also Any “red or rust stains, lots of “dust” when you hit the fabric...Stay Away from it. Seriously for a stupid chair I got massive PTSD from my horrible experience! Nothing is worth my sanity and piece of mind!! Hope this helps!! ❤️",5년 전,43,

I became a fan immediately, and religiously waited once a week for your uploads: you were like the little time-out from my life. funny, relatable, entertaining... you are so welcoming and likable.  we've watched you grow for so long, we've seen you in like 4 different homes, various hairdos, a boyfriend, gaining followers, hitting 100k, hitting 1 million, hitting 2 million. YOU'VE GRADUATED! BECOME AN...""ADULT""! we've seen you snort cinnamon toast crunch, work out, thrift, dance, laugh, cry.  i feel like i know you. you seem so genuine; I haven't been able to find many other youtubers like that. we love you for that.   and now this video, three different Ashleys going through different stages.. now we know you're moving to New York! that's amazing!  i watched one of your old videos (blond ashley, anyone?) and it's crazy to think that we've been able to watch you go through all of this.    I, we, can't wait to see where you will go next.  stay strong, stay smart, stay beautiful inside and out. we'll be here supporting you, just as you have been here for us, even indirectly.

So thank you. Second: At 40:41 I saw a bottle of that Love Hair Shampoo (is it?) and I got sort of excited because Mimi Ikonn is one of my favourite influencers out there, and Idk, I thought it was cool to see that you are using her product.

@MV-xf5rg,Ashley’s videos are the only youtuber videos ill watch all the way! The only ones...she is so inspiring and hard working and im so proud of her...i started watching her last year I think...but she has come so far and is my favorite youtuber bc of how relatable and real she is..i really appreciate the fact that she never fakes it and doesn’t let her manager control her content. She is always so humble and her content is always real. Whenver she goes on her emotional rants or gives us gurl talks those are literally my favorite vidoes cause she helps me so much...she has problems i do too but it makes everything better to “talk” it out and just hear other people’s perspectives. Idk it’s always been very healing and mind opening for me...some of the things she says have helped me change my view or just in general understand better of something...she is just literally everything i aspire to be...how she did everything she did in two and a half years idk but it did teach me that there is no such thing as no enough time...there always is and if u really want it u will make it to be enough no matter what u r doing....Thank you ashley for ur amazing videos. I look forward to what u bring next. Im really excited and ill be here to support you. I hope u stay happy and i hope ur in a better place now girl. Ur doing amazing. U r so strong and courageous. Also please TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF PLEASEEEE...Love ya!,5년 전,0,

Your sense of humour, sarcasm, all the DIYs you did- plants in used glass bottles, making your own plant hanger, using a mf pad for bandage, plus the editing with use of house map and so called GPS (wow), and that you are mature and independent enough to realise the value of money and hunting for thrifted items (seriously 1$??!!),  still managing cute outfits, plus you filmed all the footage at different time and managed to still make it not confusing and being so exact about it. Lets take a moment to realise how accurate and clean and patience she is with her work with wallpapers and managed it so well, YOU ARE A REFLECTION OF THE DAUGHTER MY MOM DESIRED BUT GOT ME INSTEAD.

I've been so excited to watch it that the moment you uploaded I immediately dropped packing presents for my family and jumped on my laptop 'cause I knew it'd be sth worth seeing on a bigger screen. Boy, you did not disappoint. I love your interior design style, how unique and you it feels, how you don't rely on trendy pieces but choose things that speak to you and have soul. How you're not afraid to use power tools and thoroughly explain your diys, or share what you found out about wallpaper or wood stains - I had no idea that the type of wallpaper you used existed! I love your editing style, as always - that bit with the doors? It's little things like this that make your videos downright cinematic. Chapeau bas. I'll be definitely rewatching this video many times. (Also WHY are plants so addictive? I started with like 3 and now my appartment is turning into a small jungle, so I totally feel you) Great job, Ashley <3",5년 전,2,

Generally speaking, landlords don't mind what you do to an apartment as long as it is returned in the exact same state it was in when you began renting.

Ashley is a super human. Her videos are a level above any others, they're always crafted to the highest of standards and you can tell the effort she puts in, I mean she handwrites her title slides!!! Her editing style, fashion taste and realistic personally has inspired many and will continue to do so.

@KaboodleDoodle," @carapace4  but my point was that she's - more than - a fashion youtuber. If you cannot appreciate that then you haven't even touched the surface of what her channel has to offer. She is a cultivated greenhouse of cultural insight, contemporary eco-consciousness, sexual liberation and empowerment. Sure, she is a fashion youtuber, but she is multi-talented. We can all aspire to be like her but we can also be inspired by the more modest parts of her life. :)",5년 전,4,
@KaboodleDoodle," @carapace4  you didn't have to be so negative, man, are you okay? :( please go take a walk to get some fresh air. All I wanted to do was leave a comment of praise for this girl because I look up to her and enjoy seeing into a different lifestyle since I'm from the UK but you had to add a downer onto nearly everything I had to say. Find something else to be pessimistic about, please :(  I hope you have a good day and a happy holidays. x",5년 전,4,

@Grogru113," @KaboodleDoodle  i think @ok is a really big fan, why else would she leave a detailed, intrinsic, long comment abt Ashleys lifestyle. She must be a bigtime follower, lol. Btw I just discovered Ashley youtube channel a few weeks ago. I really appreciated your words. She IS so creative in so many ways. I've only watched her apartment decor vids. I just saw the one where she comments abt killing brain cells because of the fumes. Hello?! She made a faux brick (foam) white wall!! I love how she just gets up and goes out and gets it done with her power tools and comments abt her projects. Anyways I was surprised to hear she also has a jewelry and thrifty vids going on? Omgosh, theres more?! Wow that is impressive!  I haven't even tapped in those vids yet. Anyways just wanted to say Thank you again for your good words re Ashley. I think she is SO creative, amazingly innovative, solution based and brutally honest abt life. No wonder she has a over a million followers.  And I LOVE how she shares her decor ideas. It got me thinking how I want to decor my home, lol. Have a blessed day👍.",5년 전,1,
