@kariminyt,"13:52 to 14:47 ""however there are various interpretations of the sacred writings"" that is true, but at least the text of The Quran didn't change for over 1400 years since the days of Muhammad living. and u can historically trace it to that time and confirm that clam. why i am telling you this, cause any holy text ( Quran , Bible , Torah ) ""Interpretations"" are from men that came after the prophets death, but the Quran text is directly from God him self to humanity through only Gabriel (the holy spirit in Christianity) and then to Muhammad and its unchanged to this day.  you can read it your self and interpret it your self.  We do believe The Bible and The Torah from god but u can not trace em back to the days of its prophets Jesus and Moses when they were living,  which opens the possibilities of other people could have change it.

And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.  Rev 21:6  And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.  Rev 21:7  He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.  Rev 21:8  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.   So, the Jerusalem or Israel of today is not. All the good Jews were dead. In fact, they will not accept any kind of faith except the Lord Jesus Christ in the New Testament.  Joh 3:16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  Joh 3:17  For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  Joh 3:18  He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  Joh 3:19  And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  Joh 3:20  For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.  Joh 3:21  But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.",7년 전,18,

Understand these very facts. In the beginning was the word, the word was God. 500 years before Mohammed existed Jesus. Why ? Because he was in the beginning and not 500 years after. Jesus is also known as the first and last. Mohammed was the last prophet, which really doesn't mean anything because Jesus is First and last. Abraham is the Arabs first Patriarchal Father. You see him bowing down to the Lord in Genesis 18 and not Genesis 1, because he did not exist in the beginning like Jesus. In fact the bible reminds us that before the I Am (God-Jesus) existed the I AM. You need no more information than that because just like your father he was around before you . Think about it for a second and it will begin to make sense. It's why Abraham worshiped only one God. Because like yourself you only had one biological father, and no one else.

Only if one could read it to know, will discover that though the Bible has been written by different people at different times(from Moses to John) it still is interconnected...Hence guided by the same Spirit. Jesus didn't abolish the Law of Moses...He rather upheld it...He set it on a higher level. To escape from all sins he taught to repent at HEART first and repentance shouldn't be just outwardly by actions following laws and rituals and traditions...Coz ""Murdering"" an enemy is a remote action we might take, but being bitter at heart towards that enemy is pretty easy for us....therefore he set Moses's law on a higher level...At a level of conscience n at the level of heart n soul that God truly desires... Jesus himself approved of Leviticus 19:18 in Luke 10:27b ""Love your neighbor as yourself.""  Then if we love the people whom we meet including those who hate us...Then, can we ever harm them, steal from them, or covet their goods...Anyways? Also Jesus revealed that adultery is not just an act...One has committed adultery(at heart) the moment He or she lays on his/her ""eyes"" on the ""other"" man or woman!!! Therefore repentance is needed at heart. Also no rituals could wash away our sins...No blood of animals sacrificed was enough for the stubbornness of humans towards His immense Love. How much sacrifice can we offr our Lord fr the forgiveness of sins? A portion of our cattlesheep or may be whole.... Would that be enough fr forgiveness of our never ending sins? This whole of earth n beings are His already and what sacrificial offering could we ever give him to please him...Our burnt offerings won't please him. But He seeing our stubbornness at heart, still wanted to reconcile us to Him...In His immense Love He prepared a perfect sacrificial lamb for us...Jesus...Who was prophesied in Isaiah already....By whose innocent blood we still sinners are justified...No work of our hands got our hearts closer to God, So God came down in flesh to reach us in person to bring us closer to Him by delivering His words to us by Jesus and manifesting His perfect Agape love through Jesus as well....So that we could also learn to ""love"" Him with all we have like He does....And also how like Father Abraham loved God with all he had....",7년 전,8,

@FatJackedNerd,"1) Judaism came from ancinet middle-east paganism, where Yahwah was a war god and El-Elyon/Elohim was king of gods/father of gods. later they became monothiest for no apparant reason.   2) Christianity was an offshoot Judaism. early Christians were considered a different sect of Jews (kinda like todays Mormons, Jehowah's Witness and Druze among Muslims) later it branched out into a different religion..    3) Islam was unique case, because pre-Islamic Arabia worshipped Allah (a Supreme being, Father of all gods) along with his daughters and children. (same belief can be found in Sumeria/Babylonian myths of Annunaki, who were sons of God). Islam rejected the notion of lesser deities and their cult and only believed in Supreme Being Allah. those lesser deities became angels and jinns, who were servants of Allah. Islam acknowledged the monothiesm of Judaism and rejected Jesus godhood instead refering him as only Prophet.

A women is the mercy and the gentleness  <vs.>   harshness      Q: How much a woman is very important in our life? 1st. They are the reason of our existence.  2nd .They are our mothers.🤱 3rd . They are our sisters. # They are the half of the society, and the other half is who women taking care of= MEN  Sadly & unfortunately, there is a great violence and abuse against a woman. I don’t mean (the physical abuse). I mean, a woman is given a bad picture by some media and commercials; they undervalue & underestimate her by using her badly to gain money through exposing her inappropriately and other stuff like that. For them, a woman has become like goods/items in the market for those who pay more. In other words, they see a woman just like a sexualized object!                                   They’re just focusing on a girl in her youth stage/period, but once she gets old, they neglect her.    Just like the gum. You chew it, then you throw it!                                                                                   Honestly speaking, many campaigns and convections stand for women’s rights resulted in: abortion, same sex marriage and other things I fell shay to say it. Those bad kinds of men claim they want  the freedom for women, but in fact, they want the free approach  to women. Woman’s rights R not from humans, they are from her Creator    Finally, we came to the last part of this article.

(Women in Islam Religion)                                                                                                                  Note: If anyone wants to judge (women’s rights) in Islam, she or he should not judge according to what Muslim society does. The women’s rights in Islam should be based on the 2 authentic sources of Islam:  1st The holy Quran (is the Divine Book of Muslim).                                                                                    2nd The Sunna of the prophet.                                                                                                                                                               So, if someone asks what Islam is? Simply, it is a way of life.                                                                           Islam has raised the status of women and honored her more than any religon; Do you know that every Muslim woman is inheriting ; it is one of her basic rights to inherit  what her parents or husband or relatives left after their death!!  (Islam) took a great care of women in all stages of her life:                                                                   •	👨‍👩‍👧‍👧As in her childhood, any father takes care of his daughters and treat them kindly; there will be a great reward waiting for him; his daughters will be the reason for him to be admitted in the Paradise (Heavenly Gardens)!!  •	A Woman in Islam as a mother, the right of the mother is far greater than the right of the father . A man came to Prophet Mohamed (the final and merciful Prophet)and  said ,I.e. the man, ""Who among people is most deserving of my best treatment?"" He said, ""Your mother"". He again asked, ''Who next?"" ""Your mother"", the Prophet  replied again. He asked, ""Who next?"" He  said again, ""Your mother."" He again asked, ""Then who?"" then your father, then your nearest, then your nearest.""  Why is a mother having this great status over the father? Because: A mother,  who used to hold you And clean you and clothes you A mother,  who used to feed you And always be with you When you were sick She stay up all night Holding you tight   Cause who used to hear you Before you could talk Cause who used to hold you Before you could walk   And when you cry Who wiped your tears? Knows your fears Who really cares? your mother   A woman in Islam is like a princess👰🏻. And when she gets old, she become like a king👸.  What a great religion it is!  After you have read all the above, I leave to compare. www.islamswomen.com                                                                                                                                                www.islamreligon.com           or visit any Islamic Center",7년 전,0,

In Islam its mentioned 0 times in the Quran and 500+ in Torah. It's only mentioned in the Hadith as a ""far away mosque"" and then guessed to be Jerusalem when they didnt even bother naming it.

But Jews didn't accept Jesus as Messiah because of blaming that Mary has done a wrong. But no one had the proof or witness. So, they split into Jewish and Christians. The Jews Plot to Crucify the Jesus., But God was watching all these. Because God is best Plotters. God ordered the Jesus to ask anyone to die in sake of God. Only a young boy raised. Again the Jesus repeated 2 times and the boy raised again. So, God replace the boy instead of Jesus and raised  The Jesus above to Heaven. Christians don't know what happened on that day. So the young boy crucified. Later Paul brought the concept of the Trinity believing Jesus as son of God and All three (Father,Son and Holy Sprite) to be worshipped.

@eleah_lyrism,"الثعلب المكار  Yes Paul the Lier and Zakir Naik the man who lead to the truth.  Do you know exactly who was Paul? I think You don't know about his life. He was a pharisee who used to kill Christians for their faith in  Yeshua. So he was a jew a true Jew who knew the Tanakh perfectly well before you say his root was pagan. If you don't know the Tanakh you have no right to pretend to know the Christian's root.   The apostle Paul was the most rejected and persecuted one when he came to Yeshua. You don't know his story, don't talk about him. Many times Yeshua showed his divinity but Muslims don't know the Bible and God never revealed  himself to them so how can they understand? Yeshua had to die (flesh) on the cross  in order to pay the price of the sin. A pure blood had to bleed. The perfect Lamb. No where in the new Covenant it is said that Yeshua prayed five times a day. This is a pure lie. You maybe need to search about the sect Al-Jandrikinieh, an indian sect who used to fast when the moon was disappearing and finished it by a great celebration when the crescent moon could be seen.  The sabaens were pagans people from the Middle-East, they used to be in contact with Ahnaf an arabian group that Mohammed joined before to problamed to be a prophet. The sabaens rituals used to pray 5 times a day...  I think you are talking to the wrong person about the trinity. I'm not triniterian at all.  YHWH our Lord is ONE. אחד. He is not three in one. He is ONE. As you know Elohim is in plurial so God can do whatever he wants.  He is so powerfull and he is illimited. Our little conscious cannot understand how much he is powerful and we use to try to define him with our knowledge, intellect while we cannot. This is impossible. We are so limited that a life or an eternity is not enough in order to know him. I think his name is clear YHWH. He WAS, HE IS AND HE WILL. He is Eternal.   Your Zakir Naik has no fruits from God. These days people pretend to be doctors but God never called them. They are false doctors completly blind and because they are blind they are leading people to the scheol.  I don't need a doctor or a prophet to know who is Yeshua and to know what I have to follow because Yeshua reveals himself. Since Yeshua never revealed himself to you.

Similarly  in case of Jesus, God made other human beings to know Jesus is His Son.  ""Matthew 3:16 As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. 17 And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.”  In another occasion as below.. "" Matthew 3:1 After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. 2 There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light. 3 Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus.  4 Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.”  5 While he was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.

@clairezet3182,"Jerusalem may be sacred to all three religions, but it is important to establish WHO built Jerusalem, who injected holiness into it -and why.  Jerusalem was built by the Jews and was the centre of the Jewish religion for many hundreds of years, until the militarily superior Rome conquered it.  In the Bible, Jerusalem is synonymours with Zion and these two worlds are interchangeable.    It is holy to Christians, but Jesus, who was a practicing, orthodox Jew, did not change its status to 'Christian Jerusalem' and the Muslim conquerors made it holy for themselves in their effort to establish their religion over anyone else's.   IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE AWARE OF THESE FACTS, OF WHO WAS THERE FIRST.  If you have a house and then someone else comes and claims it for himself, and then someone else yet - whose house is it?  THIS IS THE STORY OF JERUSALEM.  Building Al Aqsa mosque and usurping the Temple Mount exactly on the ruins of a Jewish Temple is pure hooliganism and brutality - this is the true face of Islam: thefts, killings, greed. As for the Christians - the crusaders did their bit to assert their religious superiority.  Thankfully, there are no crusaders today (the evangelicals are much milder...). Israel honours other people's rights to feel that parts of the land are holy to them - people cannot be stopped from imagining things, and this has to be respected.  But this is where it should begin and end.  If someone declares part of your garden as holy for himself - let him, but he should have no right to usurp it.  This is what the Christians and primarily the Muslims have done.    .   Israel did not occupy East Jerusalem as one cannot occupy something that belongs to you and was taken from you through force. PEACE WILL COME TO THE WORLD WHEN PEOPLE DISCERN TRUE OWNERSHIP FROM IMPERIALISM.  GIVING THE WEST BANK, =ANCIENT JUDEA AND SAMARIA OF THE JEWS, TO THE PALESTINIANS, WHO ALREADY RECEIVED 75% OF ANCIENT PALESTINE, I.E. JORDAN, WILL LET IMPERIALISM TRIUMPH.    THE JEWS ARE CHOSEN FOR A PARTICULAR TASK:  TO BRING ULTIMATE MORALITY TO THE WORLD - THROUGH THE 10 COMMANDMENTS AND THEIR NUANCES.  THERE IS NO SUPERIORITY HERE, ONLY A TEACHING HOW TO LIVE IN PEACE AND RESPECT. Without the 10 commandments, the world would sink into anarchy, as it was prior to the 10 commandments.",8년 전,2,

@sunnyphilipose9824,"The Birth of Jesus Foretold  (Compare Gabriel the angel of Jehovah God and Jibreel the angel of revelation  who recited the Quran -  Gabriel in Bible foretell Mary about Jesus: He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High.)  Luke 1:26 In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, 27 to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin’s name was Mary. 28 The angel went to her and said, “Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.”  29 Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be. 30 But the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary; you have found favor with God. 31 You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus. 32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, 33 and he will reign over Jacob’s descendants forever; his kingdom will never end.”  34 “How will this be,” Mary asked the angel, “since I am a virgin?”  35 The angel answered, “The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called[b] the Son of God. 36 Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month. 37 For no word from God will ever fail.”  38 “I am the Lord’s servant,” Mary answered. “May your word to me be fulfilled.” Then the angel left her.",8년 전,1,

@paulbortolazzo,"“Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall the earth be made to give birth in one day? Or shall a nation be born at once? For as soon as Zion was in labor, She gave birth to her children.” Isaiah 66:8  On May 14, 1948, Israel became a nation. On that day God fulfilled His promise to made her a nation again. (Isa. 66:8) Since her rebirth, millions have been gathered back to Zion. They represent the dry bones returning in unbelief just like the prophets predicted. (Ezek. 37:21; 39:27-29) Modern day Israel can be traced back to biblical times by her religion, her language, her prayers, her traditions, and her land. Her physical restoration cannot be denied. (Zep. 3:20)  ‘And the gospel must first be preached to all the nations.’ Mark 13:10  The gospel must first be preached to all nations before our gathering at the coming of the Son of Man. (Mark 13:10, 26-27, Rev. 14:6-7) This is why understanding the timing and fulfillment of the last three Feasts is so critical. But, Paul, most pastors insist only the gospel matters.

People are united or divided according to the Spirit within them, and all political and moral actions will flow out through the soul from the fountain of that Spirit.

""Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division: For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three. The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law."" (Luke 12: 51-53). ""It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life. But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.

Later, the Khazars adopted Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, learned Hebrew and Slavic, and became settled in cities and towns thruout the north Caucasus and Ukraine.

Islam means in Arabic submission or devotion - (Arabic: الإسلام al-islām, 'Submission, devotion, surrender') Islam is a monotheistic and Abrahamitic religion, founded by Muhammad Ibn Abdallah in 600´s Arabia. The holy scripture of Islam is the Quran, perceived as the literal word of God conveyed to the Prophet Muhammad. A supporter of Islam is called a Muslim - a person who belive in submission, devotion and who surrender to God the Al Mighty. But also the Cristians and the Jews  lived as muslims and were considered muslims, at the earlier Prophets times - Gods pease be upon them all. But cause of the serval thousands directions of Islam - as in Christianity and Judaism - you can not cal a muslim for a Muhammedan - Sunnies belive that the most competent as his successor among the followers of the Prophet - Gods peace and blessings be upon him - was Abu Bakr (after the Prophets dead in 632). Abu Bakr - Gods peace be upon him - was Muhammad's friend and adviser. The Shiites - Another direction of Islamists - belive, that Ali - who was cousin of the Prophet Muhammad - Gods peace and blessings be upon him - and his family-  were the rightful inheritors of Islam. One crucial difference is that the Sunnies use a series of texts about Muhammad's life and deeds (hadiths) as a guide to living a godly good life.

@sunnyphilipose9824,"Ismail ,  The planet earth is created by Jehovah God, God of Abraham. He gave a portion of earth to Abraham, his son Issac, and to grand son Jacob, whose name God Himself changed to Israel.  https://www.gotquestions.org/Israel-land.html  Question: ""What is the land that God promised to Israel?""  Answer: In regards to the land that God has promised Israel, Genesis 15:18 declares to Abraham, “To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates.” God later confirms this promise to Abraham’s son Isaac and Isaac’s son Jacob (whose name was later changed to Israel). When the Israelites were about to invade the Promised Land, God reiterated the land promise, as recorded in Joshua 1:4, “Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the great river, the Euphrates—all the Hittite country—to the Great Sea on the west.”  According to Genesis 15:18 and Joshua 1:4, the land God gave to Israel included everything from the Nile River in Egypt to Lebanon (south to north) and everything from the Mediterranean Sea to the Euphrates River (west to east). So, what land has God stated belongs to Israel? All of the land modern Israel currently possesses, plus all of the land of the Palestinians (the West Bank and Gaza), plus some of Egypt and Syria, plus all of Jordan, plus some of Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Israel currently possesses only a fraction of the land God has promised.  If Jehovah God, Creator of Universe gave them that land, who can stop Him? Any point in fighting against Creator?",8년 전,12,

@juliemckenzie5960,"Umer Farooq   why Christ can  not bring original bible ? Original bible is not exist . this bible is edited **This is why it is hard to bring many Muslims to the truth, it boils down to education. With all respect, let me, a woman, explain what the Bible is to you.**  The word Bible comes from the Greek word ""Βιβλίο"" pronounced ""Vivlio"",  which is translated as ""book"". The original manuscripts of the Bible were kept on scrolls, called books, in the synagogues. Those who had custody of the manuscripts first used the Greek word to describe the collection, which later became known as ""the Book."" ****This is why your Quran refers to Jews and Christians as ""People of the Book"".  Jewish Biblical scholars were trained to copy aged scripture word for word. It wasn't until the Hebraic and Greek texts were translated into languages around the world that mistranslations and transliterations began to occur; this happens with every widely translated literary work as languages that developed independent of each other have words that do not translate into every language directly. Apparently, unable to bear discarding aged sacred scripture, some scholars sealed them in jars that were later found at Qumran and archaeologists are continuing to confirm that these ancient, preserved manuscripts line up perfectly to modern scripture.  Among all the books ever written, the Bible is absolutely unique. Actually, it is not just a book—it’s 66 books. And one of its most remarkable qualities is the complete unity of the overall message despite having so many different authors writing over many centuries on hundreds of controversial subjects. Natural explanations fail to account for the supernatural character and origin of Scripture.  The Bible was written over a period of at least 2,000 years by 40 different authors from three continents, who wrote in three different languages. These facts alone make the Bible one of a kind, but there are many more amazing details that defy natural explanation.  Shepherds, kings, scholars, fishermen, prophets, a military general, a cup-bearer, and a priest all penned portions of Scripture. They had different immediate purposes for writing, whether recording history, giving spiritual and moral instruction, or pronouncing judgment. They composed their works from palaces, prisons, the wilderness, and places of exile while writing history, laws, poetry, prophecy, and proverbs. In the process they laid bare their personal emotions, expressing anger, frustration, joy, and love.  Yet despite this marvelous array of topics and goals, the Bible displays a flawless internal consistency. It never contradicts itself or its common theme.  Its words point unerringly to Christ, whose work on the cross was ordained by God—the true author of the Bible—before the world began.  The Old Testament has four major divisions: (1) the Law - 5 books; (2) History - 12 books; (3) Poetry - 5 books; and, (4) Prophecy - 17 books.   Similarly, the New Testament has four major divisions: (1) the Gospels - 4 books; (2) the Acts of the Apostles - 1 book; (3) the Epistles - 21 books; and, (4) the Revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ - 1 book.   A careful calculation, based on the stars mentioned, the fact that the only name used for God is Elohim, the language used and the age that Job achieved have all proven that this period, according to the Septuagint, Job lived or the book of Job was written from 2650 B. C. to 2250 B.C. ** This makes Job, the oldest book of the Bible, antediluvian (older than the world wide flood of Noah). Do you know of any 'original manuscript' that has survived this long??  ***So the Christian Holy Bible, including the Old Testament, is approximately 4,267 years old (impressive considering creationists believe the earth is 6,000 years old) while the Quran is only 1,385 years old.*** The Holy Bible is a cohesive work of 66 books written by 40 different authors over a period of 2,344 to 2,744 years with interwoven themes and messages that work together without contradiction while the Quran has 1 author, was written over a period of 23 years and it has contradictions since Muhammad began his campaign peacefully and became more violent as he gained more power.  Muslims believe that the Quran was verbally revealed by God to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel (Jibril) gradually over a period of approximately 23 years, beginning on 22 December 609 A.D. when Muhammad was 40 and concluding in 632, the year of his death.  COMMON ISLAMIC CLAIM: No other book in the world can match the Qur'an ... The astonishing fact about this book of ALLAH is that it has remained unchanged, even to a dot, over the last fourteen hundred years. ... No variation of text can be found in it. You can check this for yourself by listening to the recitation of Muslims from different parts of the world.  THIS CLAIM IS ALL WRONG. All of the Islamic evidence shows there are different canonical versions of the Qur'an used around the world today. They differ in their basic letters, diacritical dots, vowels, and the Basmalah; and these change the meaning of words and sentences. Therefore, how the Qur'an is recited around the world today is different; not all Qur'ans are identical.  Certain variant readings (of the Qur'an) existed and, indeed, persisted and increased as the Companions who had memorized the text died, and because the inchoate (basic) Arabic script, lacking vowel signs and even necessary diacritics to distinguish between certain consonants, was inadequate. In the 4th Islamic century, it was decided to have recourse (to return) to ""readings"" (qira'at) handed down from seven authoritative ""readers"" (qurra'); in order, moreover, to ensure accuracy of transmission, two ""transmitters"" (rawi, pl. ruwah) were accorded to each. There resulted from this seven basic texts (al-qira'at as-sab', ""the seven readings""), each having two transmitted versions (riwayatan) with only minor variations in phrasing, but all containing meticulous vowel-points and other necessary diacritical marks. The authoritative ""readers"" are: Nafi` (from Medina; d. 169/785) Ibn Kathir (from Mecca; d. 119/737) Abu `Amr al-`Ala' (from Damascus; d. 153/770) Ibn `Amir (from Basra; d. 118/736) Hamzah (from Kufah; d. 156/772) al-Qisa'i (from Kufah; d. 189/804) Abu Bakr `Asim (from Kufah; d. 158/778) (Cyril Glassé, The Concise Encyclopedia of Islam, p. 324, bold added)  Therefore, we need to realize that the Qur'an has been passed down to us from men called the ""Readers"". They were famous reciters of the Qur'an in the early centuries of Islam. The way these men recited the Qur'an was formally recorded in textual form by other men called the ""Transmitters"". There are in fact more Readers and Transmitters than those listed above.   THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE DIFFERENCES AFFECT THE MEANING  I am often told by Muslims that the differences between these Qur'ans are only a matter of dialect, accent or pronunciation, and do not affect the meaning, however this is clearly not the case. The differences are far more significant: they change the subject of the sentence, whether the verb is active or passive, singular or plural, and how the grammar of the sentence is to be understood. These differences do affect the meaning. The evidence speaks for itself.  Subhii al-Saalih[1] summarizes the differences into seven categories.  1.Differences in grammatical indicator (i`raab). 2.Differences in consonants. 3 Differences in nouns as to whether they are singular, dual, plural, masculine or feminine. 4.Differences in which there is a substitution of one word for another. 5. Differences due to reversal of word order in expressions where the reversal is meaningful in the Arabic language in general or in the structure of the expression in particular. 6. Differences due to some small addition or deletion in accordance with the custom of the Arabs. 7. Differences due to dialectical peculiarities.  There is help to make sense of all these transliterations, there is a six volume encyclopedia set which records all known variants. It is entitled: Mu'jam al-qiraa'aat al-Quraaneeyah, ma'a maqaddimah fee qiraa'aat wa ashhar al-qurraa (The Encyclopedia of the Quranic Readings with an Introduction to Readings and Famous Readers). A sample from a page of one of these six volumes of the encyclopedia set shows that almost every verse in the Qur'an has several variants associated with it.  I realize this may be hard for some Muslims to accept because in their culture they have grown up being taught there is only one Qur'an, however this is the fault of Islamic leaders who continue to exaggerate about the Qur'an as they attack the Bible.",8년 전,1,

And O myLord, I never remained unsuccessful after calling you'  And I fear my relations after me, and my wife is barren, then bestow me from Yourself any one who may takeover my work'.

Submitted he, 'O my Lord, give me any sign', He said, 'your sign is this that you speak not to people threenights being healthy'.  Then he came out to his people from the mosque and he beckoned to them, continue glorifying morning andevening.  'O Yahya, (John) hold fast the Book.

So please come with me, so that the creditors may not misbehave with me."" The Prophet went round one of the heaps of dates and invoked (Allah), and then did the same with another heap and sat on it and said, ""Measure (for them)."" He paid them their rights and what remained was as much as had been paid to them.Water MultiplicationVolume 4, Book 56, Number 779:Narrated 'Abdullah:We used to consider miracles as Allah's Blessings, but you people consider them to be a warning. Once we were with Allah's Apostle on a journey, and we ran short of water. He said, ""Bring the water remaining with you."" The people brought a utensil containing a little water. He placed his hand in it and said, ""Come to the blessed water, and the Blessing is from Allah."" I saw the water flowing from among the fingers of Allah's Apostle , and no doubt, we heard the meal glorifying Allah, when it was being eaten (by him).Volume 4, Book 56, Number 777:Narrated Al-Bara:We were one-thousand-and-four-hundred persons on the day of Al-Hudaibiya (Treaty), and (at) Al-Hudaibiya (there) was a well. We drew out its water not leaving even a single drop. The Prophet sat at the edge of the well and asked for some water with which he rinsed his mouth and then he threw it out into the well. We stayed for a short while and then drew water from the well and quenched our thirst, and even our riding animals drank water to their satisfaction.Volume 1, Book 7, Number 340:Narrated 'Imran:Once we were traveling with the Prophet and we carried on traveling till the last part of the night and then we (halted at a place) and slept (deeply). There is nothing sweeter than sleep for a traveler in the last part of the night. So it was only the heat of the sun that made us to wake up and the first to wake up was so and so, then so and so and then so and so (the narrator 'Auf said that Abu Raja' had told him their names but he had forgotten them) and the fourth person to wake up was 'Umar bin Al-Khattab. And whenever the Prophet used to sleep, nobody would wake him up till he himself used to get up as we did not know what was happening (being revealed) to him in his sleep. So, 'Umar got up and saw the condition of the people, and he was a strict man, so he said, ""Allahu Akbar"" and raised his voice with Takbir, and kept on saying it loudly till the Prophet got up because of it. When he got up, the people informed him about what had happened to them. He said, ""There is no harm (or it will not be harmful). Depart!"" So they departed from that place, and after covering some distance the Prophet stopped and asked for some water to perform the ablution. So he performed the ablution and the call for the prayer was pronounced and he led the people in prayer. After he finished from the prayer, he saw a man sitting aloof who had not prayed with the people. He asked, ""O so and so! What has prevented you from praying with us?"" He replied, ""I am junub and there is no water. "" The Prophet said, ""Perform tayammum with (clean) earth and that is sufficient for you.""Then the Prophet proceeded on and the people complained to him of thirst. Thereupon he got down and called a person (the narrator 'Auf added that Abu Raja' had named him but he had forgotten) and 'Ali, and ordered them to go and bring water. So they went in search of water and met a woman who was sitting on her camel between two bags of water. They asked, ""Where can we find water?"" She replied, ""I was there (at the place of water) this hour yesterday and my people are behind me."" They requested her to accompany them. She asked, ""Where?"" They said, ""To Allah's Apostle ."" She said, ""Do you mean the man who is called the Sabi', (with a new religion)?"" They replied, ""Yes, the same person. So come along."" They brought her to the Prophet and narrated the whole story. He said, ""Help her to dismount."" The Prophet asked for a pot, then he opened the mouths of the bags and poured some water into the pot. Then he closed the big openings of the bags and opened the small ones and the people were called upon to drink and water their animals. So they all watered their animals and they (too) all quenched their thirst and also gave water to others and last of all the Prophet gave a pot full of water to the person who was junub and told him to pour it over his body. The woman was standing and watching all that which they were doing with her water. By Allah, when her water bags were returned the looked like as if they were more full (of water) than they had been before (Miracle of Allah's Apostle) Then the Prophet ordered us to collect something for her; so dates, flour and sawiq were collected which amounted to a good meal that was put in a piece of cloth. She was helped to ride on her camel and that cloth full of food-stuff was also placed in front of her and then the Prophet said to her, ""We have not taken your water but Allah has given water to us."" She returned home late. Her relatives asked her: ""O so and so what has delayed you?"" She said, ""A strange thing! Two men met me and took me to the man who is called the Sabi' and he did such and such a thing. By Allah, he is either the greatest magician between this and this (gesturing with her index and middle fingers raising them towards the sky indicating the heaven and the earth) or he is Allah's true Apostle.""Afterwards the Muslims used to attack the pagans around her abode but never touched her village. One day she said to her people, ""I think that these people leave you purposely. Have you got any inclination to Islam?"" They obeyed her and all of them embraced Islam.Abu 'Abdultah said: The word saba'a means ""The one who has deserted his old religion and embraced a new religion."" Abul 'Ailya said, ""The Sabis are a sect of people of the Scripture who recite the Book of Psalms.""Supplication for RainVolume 8, Book 73, Number 115:Narrated Anas:A man came to the Prophet on a Friday while he (the Prophet) was delivering a sermon at Medina, and said, ""There is lack of rain, so please invoke your Lord to bless us with the rain."" The Prophet looked at the sky when no cloud could be detected. Then he invoked Allah for rain. Clouds started gathering together and it rained till the Medina valleys started flowing with water. It continued raining till the next Friday. Then that man (or some other man) stood up while the Prophet was delivering the Friday sermon, and said, ""We are drowned; Please invoke your Lord to withhold it (rain) from us"" The Prophet smiled and said twice or thrice, ""O Allah! Please let it rain round about us and not upon us."" The clouds started dispersing over Medina to the right and to the left, and it rained round about Medina and not upon Medina. Allah showed them (the people) the miracle of His Prophet and His response to his invocation.Lights to guide CompanionsVolume 1, Book 8, Number 454:Narrated Anas bin Malik:Two of the companions of the Prophet departed from him on a dark night and were led by two lights like lamps (going in front of them from Allah as a miracle) lighting the way in front of them, and when they parted, each of them was accompanied by one of these lights till he reached their (respective) houses.Crying of the stem of the Date-palm TreeVolume 4, Book 56, Number 783:Narrated Ibn Umar:The Prophet used to deliver his sermons while standing beside a trunk of a datepalm. When he had the pulpit made, he used it instead. The trunk started crying and the Prophet went to it, rubbing his hand over it (to stop its crying).Glorification of Allah by the Prophet's mealsVolume 4, Book 56, Number 779:Narrated 'Abdullah:We used to consider miracles as Allah's Blessings, but you people consider them to be a warning. Once we were with Allah's Apostle on a journey, and we ran short of water. He said, ""Bring the water remaining with you."" The people brought a utensil containing a little water. He placed his hand in it and said, ""Come to the blessed water, and the Blessing is from Allah."" I saw the water flowing from among the fingers of Allah's Apostle, and no doubt, we heard the meal glorifying Allah, when it was being eaten (by him).The expulsion of a liar's corpse by the EarthVolume 4, Book 56, Number 814:Narrated Anas:There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read Surat-al-Baqara and Al-Imran, and he used to write (the revelations) for the Prophet. Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: ""Muhammad knows nothing but what I have written for him."" Then Allah caused him to die, and the people buried him, but in the morning they saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, ""This is the act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and took his body out of it because he had run away from them."" They again dug the grave deeply for him, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, ""This is an act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and threw his body outside it, for he had run away from them."" They dug the grave for him as deep as they could, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. So they believed that what had befallen him was not done by human beings and had to leave him thrown (on the ground).The Speech of the WolfVolume 3, Book 39, Number 517:",8년 전,0,

Here is Prophet Muhammad's speech to Najran, A christian group:   And here are the terms in which the covenant was to be kept: In the name of God, the Merciful, the Beneficent. This is what Muhammad, the Prophet and God’s Messenger, has written down for the people of Najran when he has the authority over all their fruits, gold, silver, crops and slaves. He has benevolently left them all that in return for 2,000 hullas every year, 1,000 to be given in the month of Rajab and 1,000 in the month of Safar. Each hulla is equal to one ounce [a measure equal to 4 dirhams]. The Najran are also required to provide accommodation and expenses for my messengers, for up to 20 days. None of my messengers shall be kept in Najran more than one month. They are also required to give, as a loan, 30 shields, 30 horses and 30 camels, in case of any disorder and treachery in Yemen. If anything is lost of the shields, horses or camels they loan to my messenger, it will remain owing by my messenger until it is given back. Najran has the protection of God and the pledges of Muhammad, the Prophet, to protect their lives, faith, land, property, those who are absent and those who are present, and their clan and allies. They need not change anything of their past customs. No right of theirs or their religion shall be altered. No bishop, monk or church guard shall be removed from his position. Whatever they have is theirs, no matter how big or small. They are not held in suspicion and they shall suffer no vengeance killing. They are not required to be mobilized and no army shall trespass on their land. If any of them requests that any right of his should be given to him, justice shall be administered among them. He who takes usury on past loans is not under my protection. No person in Najran is answerable for an injustice committed by another.[9]  This covenant remained intact after the death of Muhammad until the second caliph, Umar, expelled the Christians of Najran due to violations of the peace.

Hence the notion that muslims are enemies of god, as according to our scripture you follow one of the foretold false prophets serving the devil. from our perspective the time of the prophets ended with the life of the messias and the reconciliation and peace with god. So from a christian perspective, there simply can't be a prophet after jesus's life, hence while the jews from our p.o.v. just ignore gods grace, muslims are opposing him, denouncing his grace. So no, a devoted christian submitting to god is certanly not muslim, as both religions have fundamently different gods. the christian god is at peace with humanity, so there would be no point in him punishing people like you describe. We have the freedom and burden in our religion to carry full responsibility for our actions, while also having the reassurance of a forgiving and mercyfull god. So a tradegy is for us not gods will, but a result of life on this earth and the full freedom we have. For us god steps into the picture afterwards, accepting the victims into paradise (which was in our beliefe reopened to humanity due to the sacrifice of the messias). So our god is not a punisher, who strikes down everybody who displeases him, but a loving father who helps and soothes those who suffer. So where you might see in a tradegy a punishing act of god, i see his mercy, as through the sacrifice of jesus god became solidary with everyone in agony and suffering, so every christian has the reassurance, that even though their loved ones might have died a horrible death, they are in paradise now, protected and cared for by a loving god.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@oneman7638,"shahid gulzar yes. You re not understanding the spirituality here my dear friend. JESUS s body was human... he was fully man and fully God. God s spirit was in him and came upon it for the point of our salvation, how else could we... be saved from an eternal sin. Think about it..just think about it. We have eternal sin and it needs to be paid for in full. Since we ve sinned against an immortal deity that cannot die, there is no way for God to just wipe our sins under the carpet. It doesn t make sense if he s eternally just he must punish all sin. So since he s perfect he has perfect justice but also perfect love. God tells us that love.. is greater than anything.. love everyone including your enemies, it is a greater moral standard compared to ours God gives  So out of love God himself knew from the beginning that man s only redemption could be through God Himself. THUS God chose to come into  a human body for our sake. Jesus human body was conceived.. by God s power, that is just the vessel. The body that is to the spirit. GOD S SPIRIT poured on Jesus from Heaven and stayed on him like a dove and did not leave him. Thus God s self manifested in Jesus as God The Son, because of God s attributes so they re not violated God is everywhere.. including us.. that is why Jesus said unless we believe that he is Him..The LORD we will die in our sins. So Jesus commanded followers to believe on him because God sent him, this is God s promise to the world and Israel.. tht all people will come to him and be part of his perfect kingdom.. he is God Almighty.. Allah promises sexual pleasures in heaven... think about that.. our God promises eternal life and dwelling in perfection with him in his kingdom and with Angels. And see all realms,universe, heaven etc.. Allah promises something carnal in our minds.. like sex.. something related to body in this world... Jesus is Lord because it is the only way God could save us from eternal damnation. By taking on the sin punishment on Himself. Why u think Jesus says in John....The Father is in me and I am in the Father. He s telling them his essence. His spirit is that of God, but the body is that of a human. That s why he calls upon God s authority. Because he himself becomes a slave to pay for our iniquities. Think of Allah, he says that sin can be swept under the rug. Also... Muhammad said that the Gospel or Injil was sent by Allah to people of the Book and Taurat to the Jews. Analyze historical problem Muhammad spoke those words in 6th century AD. The Injil and taurat were already around during Muhammad s time and we have documents of them to this day.. the original manuscripts found in arab land btw. They translate to our Bible of today. Atheists translated documents so that... there s no bias on translations. So our Bible is not corruupt it cant be because Muhammad attested to Bible during his time which is the same one we have today. So muhammad agreesnwitj the Bible tht Jesus is God but he then tells his followers Jesus is not God he did not die on cross. A historic fact that Jesus did die on cross during ilhis time. And muhammad only lied because it suited him at the time to become famous in Arabia. He was forming Satans counter anti christ Religion without even knowing it.",7년 전,0,

He literally fullfilled prophecy by saying these words. Then he bowed his head and gave up the Ghost. That s what the Bible says. So in the moment he was tortured and everything else that was done to him his spirit God s spirit was having God The Father essentially pouring his wrath on himself.. as he was the only one who could pay for our sins in the firstplace..

@PathOfAvraham,kaashee  That's an intresting take on it never heard that position.  Thank you. What would you call the actual inclosed  masjid building  then ? Would you call it a shirne similar to  the Dome of the Rock and the Dome of Chain ?  Or is it  the primary  masjid where as the rest of the temple mount would be a secondary/extention to the  masjid incase of over flow? ,8년 전,0,
