Which is you didn't know the CDC was sued by the American citizens through a freedom of information act and they were found to not be able to produce any evidence that most of their vaccines work. In fact it was the OPPOSITE. Their data only PROVED a connection between vaccines and autism and italy found them to be full of carcinogens.

@CarolReidCA,"Fauci's been a shill for 30+ years. Ask him any in-depth questions about any research and he may BS his way through it, yet true experts know better.   He knows healthcare administration, looks at other people's work.     Deborah Burks is working her rear end off and deserves a medal. She's more healthcare admin as well, and that's her position.  Fauci's been on, IMHPO, the wrong side of far too many decisions. He's not as negligent as the WHO, yet he's not far from it, in many cases over the last 20 years.   He was against even trying Plaquenil, until he was called on it by many in the research community. He's been responsible for our country's healthcare & especially research community being tied up in red tape for at least 30 years.    He would spend 5-10 years on research as thousands died if he hadn't been called out by the research community and the president. He cannot act in an outbreak. That's been repeated over and over. The last big one was H1N1.  He was protected, yet 17,000 people died.    Before you call someone an ""expert"", know what it is they've done in the past.    Fauci's done some good things, yet if it were up to him, again, many people would die, economies would collapse, people would starve before he actually made a decision.   Look up his record over 30 years and you'll see what I mean.",5년 전,2,

@ThomasinaJefferson-ke7xs,Phil! I’ve been trying to find your email address to alert you to a story. A friend was recently featured on Anderson Cooper for having his liver transplant surgery that was scheduled for March 25th postponed due to the virus. We’re trying to spread his story far and wide seeing as how there are STILL PEOPLE NOT TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY (Trasha Payload). He’s been given approximately 2 weeks left to live. His name is Zach Branson. I can put you in touch with him if you’d like. Here’s a link to his first CNN broadcast. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/03/31/us/liver-transplant-surgery-canceled-back-on/index.html,5년 전,1,

@krusty9570,Now you need to ask him about new data concerning the pros and cons of shutting down schools and businesses!!! Stares are already not following cdc guidelines that clearly state not to shut down anything until there is significant outbreak in your community!!! And even then there are studies that question whether this helps either!! Shutting down things is different than social distancing which does work! What these models and what the cdc doesn’t discuss are the projections when we have to open back up business and schools!!! Luckily someone did this!!! What it says is shutting down does NOT prevent cases or deaths!!! Because there will eventually be a spike in this when we re-open!! Keep everything open and isolate the most vulnerable demographic as it relates to mortality rates!!! 98% of deaths come from 60 y/o and up who are immunocompromised!!! Isolate these folks and keep everything open!!

@ThoseWhoStayUofM,"Fair interview.  Didn't ask him anything outside his purview.  His obsessive hand-washing recommendation is not correct.  Wash your hands when you change locations.  You can use hand sanitizer.  Don't contaminate new rooms to the best of your ability.  But this is not the main method by which coronavirus spreads.  It spreads from people breathing in the aerosolized virus vapor.  Cloth and surgical masks protect against breathing in droplets of virus, but they hardly protect against infinitesimal viral air.  Even an N95 mask fails to block 5% of the airborne virus in idealized lab conditions with people expertly trained to wear them properly.  The only legitimate way to stop the spread of this virus is to socially distance, meaning don't stay in one place around anybody else for more than 15 minutes.  That's it.  If you must not be socially distant, then do it outside.  Ventilation and socially distancing are the only ways.  EDIT: Oh, and if we can properly treat the thing, then all of this is terrible and prolongs the epidemic.  The correct way to defeat the virus, given a treatment, is to infect everybody or have everybody get a vaccine and then the immunity produced will starve the virus of new hosts.  A steady stream of hosts enables to the virus to spread and mutate. Get the vaccine and then lift restrictions.  Either you vaccinate up or you get a ""natural immunity"" by being infected.

Ich werde meine Worte zu einem Feuer in deinem Mund machen. und es wird dieses Volk wie Reisig verbrennen. JEREMIA 5:                  Alle Botschaften, die dir durch den Diener des HERRN übermittelt wurden; sind Feuer, die dich verzehren; und sind auch auf dem Weg, Sie zu löschen, wie in dieser fünften Nachricht erläutert. Als Sprecher des allmächtigen Gottes; Ich sagte allen Menschen, als mein Vater mir befahl, zu erzählen; nicht weniger nichts mehr; Also musst du es wissen; Von allen Nachrichten bleibt nichts ungeschehen.                Wieder zum fünften Mal; ihr menschlichen Arten hört zu! Öffne deine Ohren und Augen. Machen Sie sich Gedanken, um zu rationalisieren, und denken Sie tief darüber nach; für dein bevorstehendes Schicksal. Merken! Die unsichtbarste Zerstörung und Katastrophe kommt, um dich vom Erdboden zu löschen. ein für allemal; wegen deiner unsichtbaren, niemals aufgezeichneten Verbrechen und Sünden. Ich bin der am meisten gesündigte Mensch. angesichts dir habe ich keine Gültigkeit; du hast recht ich bin nichts; aber in den Augen des allmächtigen Gottes ist das Gegenteil der Fall. Ich bin sein vertrauter Sohn und Diener. Wie du mich als Mülleimer zählst und nichts wert bist; Ich sage eins, lass es so sein, wie du mich beschriftet hast. Ich sage es Ihnen noch einmal, sage, was Sie sagen möchten, und lassen Sie es uns hier versiegeln. bevor ich zum Hauptpunkt dieser fünften Botschaft komme; Lassen Sie uns noch etwas über mich erzählen. Denken Sie nach dem Erscheinen und Verteilen dieser Nachricht, wenn die Hölle kommt und Sie verzehrt, daran, was alle Nachrichten gesagt haben, einschließlich dieser fünften Nachricht. Ich bin sicher, Sie werden um Gnade bitten und sich auch vor diesen Psycho-Pat-Mann oder einen Mülleimer-Diener des Herrn knien.          Seien Sie an dieser historischen Kreuzung darauf vorbereitet, die Antwort zu geben, wenn Sie vor dem endgültigen Phänomen der Hölle stehen, das auftauchen wird. Um Sie über die schwerwiegende Gesamtheit der vollständigen Zerstörung zu informieren, mit der Sie konfrontiert werden, habe ich auf dieser ersten Seite nur die oben genannten allgemeinen Wörter eingefügt. Gehen wir zum Hauptpunkt dieser fünften Massage. Was ist neu in dieser fünften Nachricht?             Diese fünfte Nachricht ersetzte nicht die vorherigen drei Nachrichten, die Sie hatten. sondern um Sie daran zu erinnern, was sie getan haben und was sie jetzt auch tun und was die kommende Feuermühle und der Destillationsprozess der zweiten Phase tun werden? Die Worte des allmächtigen Gottes, die nach dieser Aussage stehen, werden dir die kommende Hölle erzählen. mit Sicherheit werden sie kommen und niemals auf irgendeine Weise und auf irgendeine Weise abgewendet werden; Lesen Sie es also in tief besorgten Gedanken. O Herr, du Gott der Rache, sie ermorden die Witwe und den Fremden. Du Gott der Rache, zeig dich und tu das Vaterlose zu Tode. Erhebe dich, Richter der Erde; Sie sagen: ""Der Herr sieht nicht."" Bestrafen Sie den Arroganten so, wie sie es verdienen.           Der Gott Jakobs achtet nicht darauf. “ Wie lange soll der böse Herr, ihr, auf das brutalste Volk achten? Wie lange soll der Gottlose jubeln? Ihr Narren, wann werdet ihr weise sein? Böse Täter sind voller Aufregung, hört derjenige, der das Ohr plattiert, nicht, prahlt und prahlt; Wer das Auge geformt hat, sieht nicht? Dein Volk soll niedergeschlagen werden, o Herr, soll nicht derjenige, der die Nationen anweist, sie korrigieren? Und unterdrücke deine auserwählte Nation; Hat der Lehrer der Menschheit kein Wissen?

Questo può essere indicato come la decisione del primo creatore.                    Oppure si potrebbe dire che la luce gialla era in mostra.  Nota: leggi attentamente il messaggio: dai tutte le pagine quando lo dai ad altri. Non diminuire, aumentare, aumentare. Per coloro che lo fanno non sarà trascurato! - Come ti ho dato liberamente, anche tu ti do gratuitamente; Se pensi che la benedizione sia maggiore, non accettarla. - Fax, e-mail, pubblicarlo sul tuo sito Web e inviarlo via e-mail. - Pubblicare sul giornale, trasmetterlo alla radio, in televisione. - Leggi cosa verrà incluso nell'ordine per coloro che non consigliano come richiesto. - Nulla è proibito fare del bene. - Un leader o un leader saranno tutti giudicati dal rimorso e dalle buone azioni. -Per i buoni lavori inizia con il piccolo! Buona lettura!  Per il mondo il 7 novembre 1998  Messo a disposizione del pubblico l'1 / 10/2000, l'intera linea di Adamo si offrì di essere consegnata allo scoperto !!  Dio Padre, Figlio, Spirito di Agrifoglio, un solo Dio Amen. Benedetto sia il Signore di tutta la creazione, Amen! Alle persone che sono sparse su tutta la faccia della terra, divise in diverse lingue e razze, a tutte le persone sparse in tutto il continente, nel kebele, nel villaggio! Ai leader e ai governanti del mondo in questo momento, ai patriarchi che ti hanno insegnato la leadership, la leadership e l'organizzazione nella fede in tutta la terra, per guidare e insegnare la tua fede! Per uomini saggi, filosofi, comandanti militari, re, organizzazioni internazionali, leader. Supponiamo che stiamo governando il mondo con la nostra saggezza, con la nostra ricchezza, e in particolare per le prostitute, gli europei, gli asiatici, gli arabi, i latinoamericani, gli africani e tutte le colonie schiavizzate in Babilonia la Grande! A tutti i figli di Dio che soffrono molto, che si sono gettati in questa grande prova e tribolazione, per la vostra fede, amore e fiducia nel vostro Creatore! Perché ho visto la parola e lo spirito dentro di me mi costringe, e io sono come una bottiglia di vino. Devo pronunciare questo messaggio, come ho visto nella parola di Dio sopra, e ho discusso con il mio Creatore di non respira e parla. Come Giona, rifiuto. Tuttavia, poiché non potevo discutere con il potere di Dio, ero costretto a obbedire a questo comandamento e, disgustato, potevo parlare del futuro stato del nostro proposito con cui avrei dovuto parlare. Vieni a questo avvertimento e giudizio in arrivo! Sono il peccatore più piccolo e il minore nella mia vita, più posso condurre una vita comoda. Sono un cittadino etiope e un bambino povero che conosci in condizioni di povertà. Il messaggio ha quattro parti:  1 ° / I saggi serpenti, i governatori, i ricchi, gli investitori peccatori, gli adulteri, gli omosessuali, gli assassini, gli stupratori, i poveri predatori e il serpente dell'antico serpente, che lavorano nella completa oscurità della legge e del serpente del giorno.  2 / si riferisce alle entità auto-organizzate di varie denominazioni, come la Chiesa cattolica, i protestanti, gli ortodossi, gli anglicani e altri che si sono affermati nel nome del cristianesimo. Si riferisce a musulmani, buddismo, confuciano, induismo e un gran numero di fedi.  3 / Si riferisce al popolo di Dio che soffre costantemente del terribile peccato e delle tempeste che si abbattono sulla terra.  4 / Sembra che l'Etiopia e il suo popolo siano i suoi futuri sovrani. In generale, troverai il messaggio di punizione e giudizio che attende il mondo in base al suo lavoro e alle sue azioni, e quindi il giudizio si basa su di essi, che ti piaccia o no.

@ThePineapple29,"Metabolic Theory of Septic Shock - Core tip: For decades septic shock has been attributed to an over-active immune response. However, immune modulation has failed to reduce mortality, casting doubt on a direct causal role for the immune response in the development of septic shock. A closer look suggests that septic shock is the result of a generalized build-up of hydrogen peroxide, a toxic cellular by-product generated as a consequence of the hypermetabolic state that accompanies a systemic immune response. This finding points to the systemic accumulation of hydrogen peroxide as a significant risk factor for the development of septic and non-septic shock syndromes.",5년 전,0,

@charitys.3862,"Im so glad that Phillip asked the more import and more variety of questions than the reporters in Trump's press conferences and such. All most of them ask is the same questions over and over, sometimes in the same conference. What do you think this is gonna do to the economy, how many people are gonna lose their jobs, crap like that. While yes those are VERY important questions and need to be asked, they shouldnt be asked over and over, especially since even the most trusted officials such as Dr. Fauci does not know the answer. We have never been through something like this, especially at this magnitude in years if ever, so it infuriates me to see people act like they know better and contradict or insult Washington's decisions. I know there are a lot of people who dislike or even hate Trump, I except that, there's no president that EVERYONE is gonna love, but that doesn't mean that we should hate on him and his decisions just because he's who he is. Like I said, we've never been through this and all we can do is ride this out and take all the precautions we can to prevent it's spread. Hating on Trump and the officials decisions is going to hender rather than help. They could get a lot more done more effectively if they didn't have people screaming at every move they make. I do agree that things could've gone into play a little sooner as far as restrictions go, but please, just let the officials do their jobs as effectively and quickly as they can for the love of goodness gracious!",5년 전(수정됨),0,

At some point the table will tilt. I want to help and protect people like any other but economic repercussions are already occurring. This is going to grow exponentially aswell. This is just as serious an issue especially if we are talking a southern hemisphere round trip of the virus.  You can't shut down and economically destroy billions of people and businesses throughout the world, the repercussions would be catastrophic arguably more so than the virus itself. Once you factor in the vast amount of resulting problems that would occur in an economic collapse.  People are not working, business are not operating and economic collapse will follow if we are not very careful in our decisions.

@artm6663,"https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2017.35.15_suppl.e17533   e17533  Background: Silver nanoparticles (SNPs) show high efficacy as targeted therapy against cancer cell lines, but have never been tested in patient clinical trials. We present the first in-human trial of SNPs in a cancer patient with a dramatic outcome. Methods: Homemade SNP solution is prepared by the patient with online instructions. Current from 3 9-volt batteries is passed across 99.99% pure silver-bar electrodes in distilled water, until the metal content of the water measures 0.09-0.15 parts per million. The manufacturer is a 77-year old male who developed multiple recurrences of nasal cavity squamous cell cancer. Over 2 years he progressed on platinum and taxane based-chemotherapy, radiation twice and 2 surgical resections. Large hepatic and pulmonary metastases were observed on PET, MRI and CT; he was initiated on hospice. Without informing his oncologist he subsequently began manufacturing and consuming the SNP solution. Results: The patient ingested 120 ml daily of the solution for 3 months leading to clinical recovery and complete resolution of cancer at all sites, persisting for 18 months. Electron microscopy of the silver solution revealed bimodal SNP size distributions; 3 & 12 nm. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry showed the basal blood silver ion concentrations of 32 ng/g. One hour after ingesting 60 ml of silver solution it rose to 46 ng/g. Urine showed no SNPs. Toxicities were not noted with this silver solution, with no evidence of myelosuppression, liver or kidney abnormalities on repeated testing. The patient underwent reconstructive surgery with excellent wound healing, and his performance status continues to improve. Conclusions: Ingestion of a SNP solution is associated with complete regression of highly refractory head and neck cancer in the absence of other anticancer therapy. Ingesting silver solution causes a noticeable and nearly immediate rise in blood silver concentration. Urinary excretion is not a major path of clearance from the body. Given these dramatic results that may be attributed to SNP in conjunction with strong preclinical data, further patient testing of SNP should be done to confirm its safety and efficacy in head and neck cancer. © 2017 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

It was a grant paid in 2002 to the EcoHealth Alliance which then gave some of that money to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The grand total being $600,000 over 5 years. Basically pennies to a large research institute. And, at that time, China was not NEARLY as much of a threat as it is now.  If Dr. Fauci had not been speaking publicly about what he knew and when, we would have had almost no reliable source of information about the virus.",4년 전,0,

@sfcarp9418,"U.S New England Journal of Medicine dated March 26, 2020 , authored by Anthony S. Fauci ( current leader of the Corona Virus Taskforce, appointed by the U.S President ) along with Clifford Lane, MD & Robert R. Redfield, MD EDITORIAL Covid-19 - Navigating the Unchartered :  transcript from article :  "" If one assumes that the number of asymptomatic  or minimally symptomatic cases is severaltimes as high as the number of reported cases, the fatality rate may be CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN 1% . This suggests that the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe SEASONAL INFLUENZA  ( which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1% ) or a pandemic influenza ( similar to those in 1957 and 1968 ) rather than a disease similar to SARS or MERS which have had case fatality rates of 9 to 10% and 36%, respectively ."" * end quote *  So , the guy whom has Trumps ear and has said we have to panic 2 months ago, now says that the EVIDENCE that they have tells them CV-19 is LESS FATAL than SEASONAL INFLUENZA !!  And still the U.S is completely shut down and Military INFANTRY TROOPS along with reserves, tanks & heavily armoured vehicles roll out across America !!  Wake up people !

Covid-19 isn't as scary as some people want us to think it is. I think that the pricing and amount of components needed to be quieter like he was issued by the government to make sure that his head was not able to make it to the job site and he was yelling like a little bit of the time when their first meeting with his wife went on the phone and he said covid 19 has an estimated R0 of 2.5; common cold has R0 of 3.4. and is not a good fit for the price of the house he was yelling at. He wasnt moving so we threw beer cans at the same time and he was some kind of big girl who was in the hills and we were going on to get some of the electronics from our home. Avian flu has a lethality rate of approx 60% rabies has a lethality rate of almost 100% and pneumonia can be as high as 30% for severe cases. Coronavirus's lethality rate hovers around 4%.

@marlonvite4152,"Pay attention people:   Make sure you search on youtube how much hospitals owners (private or public) charge per hour but before you do that PLEASE make sure your heart is healthy.    For years I have sprayed alcohol for disinfecting wounds (or any disinfectant) over a paper towel (or cloth or dust mask) and smelled its vapors when I felt the symptoms of respiratory infection or when I met someone with the symptoms. I do this until I stop feeling the symptoms.   I meet people from all over the world, for sure asymptomatic of many infections so I practice the above often.   I am not a doctor so DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO ME. This only have worked for me.    DO NOT read the rest that follows.   Presidents, governors, mayors, police, etc most are not doctors either. Agree? But they are prescribing to us.   ""They"" told us thousands of times ""wash everything often"" but they never told us how to disinfect the interior of our respiratory system. Why is that?   Those that know me say often to me ""you never get sick"" and I used to tell them that I do the above.   I stopped saying what I do because the reaction was a laugh, silence and their body language telling me that I was ""asstupid""   This pandemic tells me that it is my duty to share. You don't Agree?   One youtuber even said this ""you should not be dispensing vague medical advise"". He was probably a doctor, nurse, attorney, someone who was put in jail for giving medical advise, or a ""friend"" trying to help me out but I doubt. He never explained. What do you think?    My brother is an orthodox medical doctor and former director of a hospital and he is skeptical. He only hears me out.   The fact is that presently thousands are dying in the hands of precisely the doctors, nurses, hospitals, politicians, pharmaceuticals, etc and they will get paid billions. agree?   Highly contagious laboratories atomize the air with disinfectants to disinfect anyone coming in or leaving the laboratories as you may have seen on movies. Agree?   They tell us wash hands and clean all surfaces. Agree?   BUT the health system never say disinfect the interior surfaces of your respiratory system. Why is that?   Doctors continue to sell ""medicine"" for all forms of respiratory conditions knowing that most viruses can easily be killed by alcohol on contact.    I also drink a few shots of scotch until tipsy (blood intoxicated) because I observe that alcoholic beggars don't get infections even though they live among infection probably because their blood is full of alcohol. I am not alcoholic and actually dislike alcoholic taste.   Infections are not the problem.   If one were to see every surface under a nanoscope we would see infecting monsters of horrendous sizes almost everywhere.   Infection is everywhere. Agree?   In the doctor's mouth behind his mask, gloves, clothes and equipment.   This present virus is not that lethal either, agree?   This virus does not kill on contact. Agree?   Is only lethal for the weak. What do you see?   But kills not only the weak of their immune defense.   The weak in logic understanding. Agree?   The weak in practices that prevent everybody's infection.   The weak in understanding that this virus only kills the weak that allows the virus to multiply in their own respiratory system.   The virus does not multiply in a respiratory system that is disinfected often with a simple smell of disinfecting alcohol or a similar disinfectant.   Infection is in every surface out there but when it gets inside our respiratory system is where it kills us rather slowly by asphyxiation blocking the Oxygen to the lungs and then to all organs. Agree?   Smelling alcohol works like smoking marijuana, straight to the lungs and there straight into the blood stream, just like any inhaler already prescribed by doctors. Agree?   Why doctors don't tell people to smell alcohol when they actually prescribe all forms of other inhalers?   Is it because respiratory infections would stop all the product that they blindly recommend to buy and products will not be sold and people will not be hospitalized with billions of dollars unable to collect?   Why so many individuals allow themselves to not practice the above and avoid this way going to a hospital to die in the hands of the doctors they believe in for not practicing disinfection where it counts?

He loves you so much, and he came to earth about 2000 years ago as Jesus Christ to die on the cross and forgive you for everything you have ever done wrong. He also rose from the dead so that you can live as he designed us through his holy spirit. If you care about eternal life so that you never face death or punishment for your misconduct, you just know that you cannot do any work to go to heaven (e.g. to feed the homeless) . No, it's just about allowing God to come into your life personally, to have a relationship with him and to daily choose not to do bad things (""bad"" things by his standards, not ours). I hope you will consider this offer of eternal life by believing in Jesus, because I personally did, and life is so much better and full of hope. I have not dealt with thoughts of suicide or depression like I used to, because God's spirit is real and it comforts everyone who accepts it. Thank you and have a nice day!",5년 전,0,

@j.d.schultzsr.9215," @HelloHello-ze6lv , I am happy for you.  With the Conavid19 hospital visitor restrictions, qualified- midwife home delivery may be a windfall way to be present for the birth of your child.  When I watched my son (complete surprise, before ultasound) come out and handed to me was the most emotional moment of my life!  From the time when I held his beautiful 10lb. 12oz., minutes-old body to this minute, I consider fatherhood the most educational and maturing experience of my life. Since his mom was our principle breadwinner and I was a GI-Bill student, I switched to evening classes, so my boy was all-mine, ALL DAY!  We learned to walk, talk, and read books (he had dozens of children's books) we learned our colors, numbers, alphabet together, from Sesame Street, Mr. Rogers, Make a Wish, and Let's All Sing a Song Today.  As we enjoyed discovering the world around us, I knew I was teaching him, but never expected how much HE was teaching ME! The lessons I learned from my son served me well in my subsequent education and career as a nurse.  I was priveliged to witness and assist in several deliveries, even though saddened that so many of them were single mothers surrounded by strangers.   I am profoundly saddened when I see so many single mothers of young children, since for most of these broken families, there is a father bereft of the delights of children sharing their lives.  If these dads only knew what they were missing, the divorce rate might vanish altogether.   On the other hand, I remember seeing a family of four in the emergency room with two small chidren being constantly but softly sung-to by their father.  Sadly, these days, much parental attention is circumvented by the parents' addiction to cell phone ""conversations"" until their children are old enough to play their own video games.  I am saddened when I see 3-4 member families eating a restaurant meal without a word of conversation, EVERY ONE transfixed by their smartphones.  If I could give  one piece of advice to new parents it would be TURN OFF YOUR PHONES, fron 5 minutes to an hour or two EVERY DAY for ""special time"" together, reading a bedtime story, singing a lulaby, discussing each other's joys, sorrows, fears and triumphs as well as sharing each day's experiences.    You and your other half may be pure happenstance beneficiaries of the most precious gift imaginable by having your baby together and possibly a very long time to share early childhood.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

Only fact available to world is covid 19 is weaker in tropical.  Some of the tropical countries used hot water as a remedy to ease off breathing difficulties. Patients were given hot water to drink regularly. This will dilute the covid 19 in blood and hot water (warm water) will make covid 19 weaker. This will ease off the blood circulation well and make breathing easy.  This could be used as first aid or used as sivior cases too.

@jkemwoodson951,"The timing of this release is suspect. Genetically modified viruses are generated through genetic modification, which involves the directed insertion, deletion, artificial synthesis, or change of nucleotide sequences in viral genomes using biotechnological methods. Maybe after multiple stimulus deals and massive world wide economic loss; the remaining people will rethink population control or population tailoring. Innocent people should not have their lives and future generations eliminated if this was a lab modified virus. Another thing, did corona virus exists 2000 years ago? So why is it jumping from animal to human now? The real important questions of who and why are not addressed. Maybe science helped corona virus become a 2020 pandemic this time?

Wash your hands so much so your immune system goes down and you can get sick. Uk.gov it says that COVID 19  is not a high sequence disease pandemic. Look it up this dude is in the spot light and he is soaking it up. People die every single day now that this plan demic has happened and the fake news is fear-mongering everybody and has made it where government has total control and people have just rolled over and allowed it. It will come with a cost and this stimulus check that you're going to get is not going to be enough to do anything for you, ppl are losing there business over this. This is the death of small businesses and possibly the death of the middle class. But government would never lie to it's ppl, have you had your head up your ass so much to thank government has good intentions. I can tell you what the most dangerous virus/disease is in the world.

@MidniteMeatBus," @Wolf-Chalk  you will be okay buddy I would for the time being just try to self isolate and dont stress yourself out that will only make you feel more sick. From what you posted, it does not sound like you have coronavirus at all. Because if you were to actually have coronavirus and you developed even one symptom (in this case you feel something in your chest), you will for sure get all of the symptoms which include dry cough, complete loss of appetite, loss of sense of smell, bad headaches, fever, cold chills and short of breath. If you dont have any of those other symptoms and its been 8 days, I HIGHLY doubt you have coronavirus. However, its very imporant to keep in mind that even if it is just a chest infection, that means you REALLY dont want to be picking up the virus while you already have the chest stuff going on because that is when shit can get really serious really fast. I pray you are safe my man. Drink lots of fluids, stay home, wash your hands most importantly stay calm.   Also maybe dont watch the news for a bit considering all they do is show you freaky death toll and infection numbers without putting those numbers into perspective in an attempt to scare you becase the news is all about ratings lol.",5년 전,0,
@Wolf-Chalk," @MidniteMeatBus  Yeah all I've had is a congested chest [tho I had a fever on and off for the first four or so days, thats long passed], the other symptoms people have with Corona don't seem to match me which is one of the few things giving me comfort. I'm on a strong antibiotic and albuterol for the chest discomfort, its mostly like a strong tickling sensation and there's no pain, just discomfort. I think whatever I caught was from my dad but whatever he had seemed worse since he was hacking up a lung nearly all day long. So far I've just isolated myself and haven't even gone close to my family who live with me, don't want to risk infecting them with whatever this is. Part of me humors its bronchitis bc I catch that yearly due to my asthma and the seasons changing.",5년 전,0,

@MidniteMeatBus," @Wolf-Chalk  sounds much much more like bronchitis than corona. I think its safe to say you certainly dont have the virus. This might sound freaky and im not trying to scare you but Im telling you straight up how it is.......if you DID have corona you would know for sure by now considering you have asthma. If you had it you for sure would have already been in the hospital the day you started to display symptoms considering having asthma makes the virus much more deadly. I however feel a bit concerned after what you said about your father. If you dont mind me asking, is he back to normal or is he still sick or worse? Also its good that you are finding things to comfort you. Stress will not help in fighting off any kind of sickness it only prolongs it.

@MidniteMeatBus," @Wolf-Chalk  really good to hear that your father is better. You certainly dont have corona, the fact that you have ashtma and are feeling as well as you do after you have already been sick for days on end instantly eliminates the possibility of you having the virus. Stay safe buddy and dont be worried!!! As long as you and your family are taking the proper precautions ( sounds like you already are)  you dont have a single thing to be worried about. The best thing you can do is call  your dad and remind him of how much of a troop he is for working through the virus and how thankful you are for his support. Wish you and your dam the best of health!!!",5년 전,0,

If viruses from 100+ years ago couldnt wipe out half the population when we had criminally inferior medicine compared to what we have today......then there is not a chance in eternal hell that a virus in this day and age could.

@williamengel8729,"REPENT AND SEEK GOD!  Crazy times are upon us.  There’s no denying it.  Jesus Christ could very well crack the sky open and return quite soon.  Our only recourse is to recognize our need for HIM, REPENT (turn from our own thinking/mindset/ways), and SEEK GOD alone in His Word and prayer.  Only HE can wake us up and reveal to us accurately the condition of our own heart, and the season we’re in as a nation/world.                         “Is there anything I need to get right with God?”    This should be at the forefront of our minds right now.  Let’s ASK the LORD to show us anything we need to deal with, and TRUST Him to show us.  He promises we’ll find Him IF/WHEN we seek Him with our WHOLE HEART.  We must do that, now!  God is a righteous God!    SIN CANNOT AND WILL NOT ENTER HIS KINGDOM!   WE MUST REPENT NOW BEFORE IT’S TOO LATE!   HE’S STILL GIVING US TIME!!  Behold, the LORD’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save, or His ear dull, that it cannot hear, but your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden His face from you so that He does not hear.  (Isaiah 59:1-2)  (We do not REPENT to a priest or fellow man.  There is only one Mediator between God and man - the LORD Jesus Christ.  He broke open the Holy of Holies when He died on the cross.  We REPENT directly to our Father God!)  Seek the LORD while He may be found, call upon Him while He is near.  Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; let him return to the LORD, and He will have mercy on him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.  “For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways,” says the LORD.  “For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.”   (Isaiah 55:6-9)  “YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN!”  Jesus answered and said to him, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”  Nicodemus said to Him, “How can a man be born when he is old?  Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?”  Jesus answered, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’  The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes.  So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.”  (John 3:3-7)   Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Men and brethren, what shall we do?”   Then Peter said to them, “Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.  For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call.”  (Acts 2:37-38)  1. Repent from your sins =      Turn completely from your own ways  2. Be baptized in water in the name of Jesus Christ      (after repentance) = Understanding that the old you is      DYING WITH CHRIST, and that you are RISING ANEW into      a completely new life, to be lived as Christ determines from      now on!       Old things are PASSED AWAY –      BEHOLD ALL THINGS HAVE BECOME NEW!  3. Be filled with the Holy Spirit of God =      This is not a “feeling”, but a LIFESTYLE      of ABSOLUTE SURRENDER to Jesus Christ,      and being led moment by moment by His Holy Spirit!!  Please surrender to Jesus Christ if you haven’t already!  It’s not about religion.  It’s about a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.    We must cast down EVERYTHING to do with SELF and ALL false religion and tradition that perverts the truth of God’s Word in ANY WAY, and SURRENDER TO GOD, HIS WAY, as He reveals to us in His Word!    We MUST be done with ALL OTHER THINGS we’re leaning on.    We CANNOT trust in SELF or OTHERS, ONLY GOD!  Do not receive the mark of the beast!  Thus says the LORD, “Cursed is the man who trusts in man and makes flesh his strength, whose heart departs from the LORD.  For he shall be like a shrub in the desert, and shall not see when good comes, but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land which is not inhabited...   Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, and whose hope is the LORD.  For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters, which spreads out its roots by the river, and will not fear when heat comes; but its leaf will be green, and will not be anxious in the year of drought, nor will cease from yielding fruit.”  (Jeremiah 17:5-8)  LET US TURN TODAY FROM ALL OTHER ‘gods’ AND ‘idols’, TO THE ONE TRUE GOD, WHO ALONE MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH AND IS WORTHY OF ALL GLORY HONOR AND PRAISE!!  Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers… For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit and in much assurance...   And you became followers of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit... Your faith toward God has gone out… how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, even Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.

@bernadettestar,"Just a thought on vaccines, if you demand an antibodies test for any virus they try to mandate, if you prove that you have antibodies you do not have to get the vaccine.  I would like to see an immune doctor on your panel on TV news to address questions that people are asking like: Why do doctors say to raise your immune system to help the people at home? Why are NY hospitals using vitamin C infusion on the CVIRUS and doctors recommend taking a lot of C, can you have an immune doctor answer this? Why do the immune doctors say  as much sunshine as possible and the TV doctors say, stay in?  You can take your kids out and they can be 10 feet apart.  Snce they say it was sprayed originally from a lab in China as it was tracked, if true, people are asking, couldn't it be sprayed every year?  I'm not asking if you believe it, is it possible? The Chinese do say it is an American problem originally and they say it was patented here. Don't answer thar unless you do some thorough investigations, thank you. Since 35,000 to  80,000 in America died of the flu last year, and we never shut down, do you think it's wise to cripple the economy anymore over something that is totally an 80 year old with pre-existing conditions average mortality rate virus according to China and Italy? we had to borrow 2.2 trillion and if President Trump would have gotten us out by Easter that would have been a month and we don't need to be far away more money to keep people home.Now they're saying it's going to take his end-of-the-year to restore our economy. I noticed on TV that the US doctors are saying the same thing about our mortality numbers and Dr. Fauci degrees. He said, sequester yourself for 14 days but nobody's doing that because everybody must go  to the grocery store and to the pharmacy. Doctors are saying that by now just about everybody has been exposed to the coronavirus in the US because they have to go to the grocery store or somebody comes in with groceries etc. and it was going around for quite a while before people were staying at home but since we never shut down for any flu, why should we  be shutting down past Easter for this virus?

Also my wife works at a private nursing home. We have no choice but to go out for essential reasons, all I can say is wear your protective gear, eat immune system enhancing foods and make sure to disinfect EVERYTHING you bring home including yourselves. Unfortunately for a lot of people, contracting this disease is inevitable (those living in poverty and cannot afford essentials, elderly people, those with low immune systems, etc.) But we all have to do our best to protect ourselves and others. If you must go out for something make sure to get everything you need in one go (that doesn't mean panic buying toilet paper!) Because the less you go out the safer you are.

@schmeagol90,"I share this with you because I love you all deeply. I dont share to push anything, but there is an urgency and I want to share because I care.  Time is so short, and our lives are like vapors. We all share in common that one day we will die, and none of us know that day or hour, but it will come and it's important to know where we'll be for eternity. There are only two places, heaven or hell; there is no in between state. There is only one way to heaven, and that's through Jesus. He is the way, the truth, and the life just as His word says. I get being unsure, I get the world we live in throwing out all kinds of things anymore, and it can be hard to know what the truth is, but there is an absolute truth and it is Jesus, and His work on the cross for our salvation, so believing in Him we can have peace in our eternity. We are all sinners in need of a Savior, and Christ knew we could not and can not save ourselves. So God Himself came down in the flesh and lived the perfect righteous life for us, fulfilling all the commandments.  He was then crucified and willingly layed down His life and was forsaken by the Father on the cross to take the punishment for all our sins. He was buried and rose again on the third day. His resurrection defeated death, and proved that His punishment was payment enough for the Father for our sins. For the wages of sin is death, but Jesus paid our wages with His death and ressurection! He did all of this so that through Him we would now have a way to heaven, to be with Him forever because He loves us. He died our death. He was spotless and blameless for us, and when we believe in Him, He imputes His righteousness to us, and cleanses us of all our sins.  I pray that you would not turn your heart to this, or shrug it off, or think about it later Please think about it now, there is no promise of later for anyone.   If you are unsure, please be sure either way, that yes Jesus is who He says He is, or no He is not. Seek the Truth, and Jesus says if you seek Him you will find Him. He IS the truth you will discover. Eternity is on the line, and more so than ever in history He is returning so soon, and unexpectantly to those that dont believe, and He wishes for none to perish, but all to come to faith. God loves you fiercely. He created you and knew you before time even began, He had you in mind, and demonstrated His love that while we were yet sinners Christ died on the cross for us. To redeem us to Him. He has made a way for you, and all you have to do is call out to Him. Realize you are a sinner before a Holy God, and in need of a Savior. Repent (change of mind and heart) of your sins, and believe in the finished redemptive work of Jesus Christ on the cross alone for the remission of all your sins (past, present, future) and eternal life!   When you declare with your mouth Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart man believes and is justified and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation (Roman's 10: 9-10)   For it is by grace you are saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God, not by works lest any man should boast (Epehsians 2:8-9)  Call on the name of the Lord. All who call on the name of the Lord shall be saved (Roman's 10:13)  https://savedmag.com/bill-gates-quantum-dot-digital-tattoo-implant-to-track-covid-19-vaccine-compliance/",5년 전,0,

The problem with the WH press conferences isn't the reporters, it's Trump pushing bullshit during these conferences. I think my favorite is still when he claimed that he'd known it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic. Literally two days before the WHO officially declared it a pandemic Trump tweeted this out   ""So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!""   And on February 24th, just a couple weeks before the WHO declared it a pandemic, he tweeted this out   ""The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!""

From the bunch of apples on the table they will always pick the one that starting to spoil and they will leave the healthy ones alone. The flies have to eat. And the only suitable  source is rotten fruit. Then after they eat they multiply and eat again. They have job to speed up destruction of bad rotten fruits down to atoms , so the nature can use those building blocks and produce more plants, animals, humans etc . Virus have same needs and doing same job. If human body not clean and accumulate too much waste matter from bad foods, drink, toxic drugs, vaccines, bad air- all this stuff overwhelming body elimination system and body starts collecting its inside. That garbage attracts virus. Not human . Virus don’t care - it’s hungry and want to eat.   And like fruit flies each virus can eat only specific food. No matter how hungry fruit flies it’s not going to eat rotten meat - for rotten meat we have green flies.  No way to hide from virus -it’s looking for food not on physical level but on vibration level and it will find it .

Every flu mutate mutates for the better at certain times and worse at times, I hope this does not mutate for the worse. Next question:: We know parts of the planet are melting, i.e., ice shelves. My question is; is the world becoming more recluse? Here is the most important question: If a person had SARS does that give them more of an immunity and visa versa had MERS?

@DrawbackDrawback,"You do realise a mask barely does anything, right? It's a respirator that is actually effective, but those are very thick and hard to breathe in. You can't wear them for very long without needing to take a breath, and if everybody starts grabbing respirators we'll have a shortage and people who actually need them in hospitals and such won't have them. Oh wait, there is a shortage. The regular masks are for people who have COVID-19. They're the ones who need to wear them to protect others. If you were to wear a regular surgical mask, guess what, you're protected...against dust. Not COVID-19.     Seriously, every time I see people walking around with surgical masks or something similar I immediately judge them for not doing the tiniest bit of research to understand how ineffective what they're doing is. All they're doing is taking masks from people who actually need them. So no, he doesn't need a mask. Why you think that I have no idea. There's no evidence to suggest a surgical mask will prevent you from getting COVID-19. You might as well not be wearing one. The only plus side is you won't be touching your face.     You, random internet person, are telling a professional what they should be doing, without even taking a second to consider why the professional is not doing what you think they should. Learn to question things. Just because there are now a bunch of people walking around with surgical masks, doesn't suddenly mean it's effective. They're either scared morons, or they're actually sick. If you are not sick, you do not need a surgical mask. Respirators should go to those who truly need them, as in doctors and nurses, etc.      Think about it like this. Bob gets COVID-19. Uh oh. Now Bob needs a mask so that when he needs to make trips outside for essential reasons, he doesn't infect anybody. Oh wait, people have panic-bought them and now there's nothing for Bob. Poor Bob.     Don't fall for the hysteria. Be smarter. Follow the guidelines.",5년 전,1,

If your body encounters the virus and successfully fights it off, you will make antibodies that protect you (though as he said we don’t know the lifespan of these antibodies at this moment).  A good example of why this is likely the case are vaccines. People receive vaccines for a wide variety of illnesses and they may or may not have symptoms of an immune response (fever, aches, redness etc.) but you will still develop that immunity as long as your body has a successful response to that vaccine.",5년 전,9,

(1) The most common & telltale symptom seems to be a fever, right? Thermometers are a common household item. Along with hand hygiene & social distancing is there some reason authorities aren’t recommending everybody monitor their body temps daily ?   Obviously- a normal temp doesn’t mean you ‘don’t have it’ but a sudden spike/fever ‘may’ indicate that you do. sooner one knows the better for everyone.   A cough could be anything... a cough alongside a body temp rising to 100+ should be insta-self quarantine call a physician ASAP without question I would think.   2) they’re saying it can remain in the air for 3 hours.. is there any merit to spraying down the air of the room you’re in with disinfectant or is their any scientific thoughts on forcing it to settle vs letting it “float” around waiting to be inhaled ?

The flu doesn't cause hospitals to be so overwhelmed that they have to start clearing out space from different wings so that they can create more space for ICU's. It doesn't cause doctors to  have to be working extreme hours because the hospitals simply need as many hands on deck as possible to try to fight back against it.

It stated that there were some people testing positive for this virus that also experienced GI issues, either solely GI issues, or GI issues accompanied by the rest of the common symptoms associated with this virus. Just wanted to let people know that this virus does have the potential to act differently in different individuals, so just because you're not having the most common symptoms, doesn't mean you don't have it, and that's why social distancing is so important, especially if you are ill in anyway.

@mariafierro3485,"Testing has varied from state to state on who gets it and why. Some states only test you if you show severe symptoms while others will test you upon request. It’s really something that leaves many people feeling unsure and anxious. In my state (Utah) it’s a little pick and choose. My sister got tested (positive) because she traveled to Europe. She was only tested because she woke up with mild symptoms. I have had direct contact with her for several days, and had sort of a phlegm in my throat. After we found out she was positive I contacted the testing site and was given a test. The only reason I was given a test after such close contact with a positive person was because of the phlegm. My boyfriend who lives with me was denied a test. Even though we’ve both had super close contact with a positive case. It’s worrisome because we for now, show mild to no symptoms. I hope it stays that way. I am honestly so terrified. My point in all of this is that not many are being tested that SHOULD be. It shouldn’t be if you show symptoms or not.

Look at Italy , all the doctors and nurses are getting killed by this virus.  Meanwhile non infected people are dying as collateral damage from heart attacks, strokes and even giving birth.  Only certain facilities should be certified to treat infected virus symptoms and confirmed cases.  Don’t let this virus supersede our guide lines and protocol.  The virus is not only kill us but it is being allowed to destroy our hospital system and our economy.  Stimulating the economy will have to go on Forever.  All you are going is jump starting a heart attack patient’s heart.  You can’t do that every day. One day it will no longer work",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@MyIronman8,That yeah that's why I thought. The doctor never said his name. So this guy never did talk to him . When you talk to people especially doctors you call them by their name . And then there are supposed to say oh thank you and say your name back too you . Through this whole 14 minutes and 58 the doctor doesn't say your name at all . And it kind of looks like you piece this all together . it looks like you used the video of him talking to someone other than you . and then you put your video of you asking the same questions . And then everybody falls for it . So if I Google this video I won't find someone else asking the same questions on another video will I .,5년 전,0,

@heathermarie5139,"Is there a medical professional/researcher here who can clear something up? My pharmacist (I'm a tech) and I were chatting about vaccines the other day, and not all vaccines are good forever. For example, we get flu vaccines every year, and yeah, a large part is because we get slightly new flus every year. However, when they miss their guess with the flu vaccine, it's STILL better to get it than not because it'll offer some protection. Then having a flu shot the year before should offer similar protection than getting a shot that's a miss...but it's not.  People get titers for various reasons as they get older, and learn that they've lost immunity to things they've gotten vaccines before. Some people have to get multiple shots (like more than the normal boosters) to produce an adequate immune response,  some people never get enough of an immune response. Most of us who are older probably aren't as immune to measles anymore (scary thought), and rely on herd immunity of those who have gotten the vaccine more recently.  Anyways, how can he be confident that one shot and you'll most likely be good? With how infectious this is, and all the opportunities it's getting to mutate, I'm not as confident, but then again, I'm just a tech. Would love to hear from someone who has studied this.",5년 전,0,

@blairboyd4982,"Listening to this man saying he is a medical doctor of disease epidemic expert, in the very 1st place why these scientists kept making these dangerous diseases killing off people. You don't strongly believe that those scientists should be charged for all the deaths of those people, it is different from someone going with a gun shooting off people. Or some planting a bomb into a crowded place,I would like the experts  answered this question,  if those scientists is any different.From those people committed those dangerous crimes killing off people with guns,or whatever weapons. Those scientists that developed this kind of disease epidemic expert, they should be hold accountable for the deaths of those people. Plus putting the countries in the world into more poverty, or this diseases  epidemic is a cleansing of the world population. The scientists who is making these dangerous diseases killing off people, over the years, they should be hold accountable for the deaths of those people. Because this kind of situation is very dangerous putting millions of people out of jobs, shutting down the airports, seaports, schools, etc, etc.Causing the world into more poverty, or the whole thing is just a another conspiracy theories. I would like to know which country is going to hold accountable for this destruction, and who is going to paid for the world damages. Or this is the new order,that  everyone is trying to be the world leader with this kind of disease epidemic expert. I was looking at the various influenza virus which several countries develops over the years, and to my surprise.  From as far as 1918 the Spanish flu which killed off 20 to 30millions people, also  infected over 500 million people worldwide. The more recent one the swine flu in 2009,and the amount of people got killed from the flu.Then I realized it is nothing new, because I could remembered the Hong Kong flu in the 1960s I was a big boy going to school at the time, Mankind is their own destruction of themselves, because they created all these dangerous diseases killing off people. Which they hardly can control the plague after creating them,this disease epidemic is very, very dangerous to human beings health. Putting millions of people out of jobs, it is going to caused millions of people loosing their cars,houses you named it.  The people who have millions also  billions it is not going to affecting them,it is going affecting the entire world poor people.

No need for an expensive shot just stay healthy and get healthy with zinc!!! There are other antivirals but 350 cures proves the malaria drug works against this virus. And it is cheap! This is what the president was talking about when he said this could be over soon and this doctor snickered behind the presidents back because he will block this cure so he can make money on his new shot.

@jamesconway4821,We can use our large international airports as large covid-19 hospitals we can supply these covid-19 hospitals with beds from the cruise ship industry each ship has thousands of beds we could strip them of their beds linens and pillowcases even using nightstands and chairs we could fill an entire airport up and make it into a large covid-19 Hospital supplies could be brought in by airplanes and unloaded right to the airport Hospital they would also be able to accommodate large truckloads of supplies and also be able to accommodate the military as well we could do testing in the parking garages and parking structures of the airport since airports are designed for large volumes of traffic and people it would work out great airports also have plenty of lighting and plenty of room they also have plenty of power supplies they're even equipped with large handicap ramps making it easy for stretchers and wheelchairs to be wheeled around and medical equipment we can also use the cruise ships kitchen and staff to keep supplying meals to those that are shelter-in-place at home or are too sick to venture out or are afraid to venture out in fear of spreading the virus we could also use the cruise ships to supply meals to the covid-19 hospital particularly the airport covid-19 Hospital the government should be mandating Boeing to be making respirators they have mass production facilities where they can make engines in mass production and airplane equipment in mass production there's no reason why they can't take a patent of a respirator and put it in mass production the car companies could join in as well by using all these companies would help them qualify for federal funding assistance in the loss of wages that they acquired due to this covid-19 outbreak and would help fight against covid-19 in an extreme way so we just solved the problem of space for putting covid-19 patients we just solved the bedding problem we just solved the ventilator problem and if we could have our government make full body hazmat suits that they already have the design for we could solve the p p e problem as well and we wouldn't have to worry about Hunger or starvation for those that are isolated at home if we utilize companies like cruise ships to make the meals we can also hire restaurants to join in the effort kind of like the Meals on Wheels program cruise ship kitchens and staff are already used to making thousands of meals a day for cruise ship and there are literally hundreds of cruise ships out there available to be used I do not think it's a good I use idea though to use the cruise ship itself as a hospital as we already know the Diamond Princess proved that the virus covid-19 can spread rapidly especially if it gets into an aerosol formation like it did on the Diamond Princess where it has the ability to go into a flying aerosol formation even finer than droplet formation this is why we should be advising people that an n95 mask may not be sufficient and only stops 92% of the transmission rate and that's only if it's in droplet form if it goes into hyper aerosol form it can go right through an n95 mask we should also be advising are healthcare workers to wear goggles if they do not have a full body hazmat suit cuz it can get into the mucus of their eyes in concert reminding are healthcare workers to change their gloves often,5년 전,0,

The problem aren’t vaccines, per se, but PRESERVATIVES. Not just Thimerosol, but basically any number of creepy chemicals. Go to a small lab or a doctor attached to one and pay extra for a vaccine straight off the assembly line. Same clean quality as the 1950s. Furthermore, skip at least every other year.

There are a good bunch of readily available supplements that are 100% proven to both increase the immune response against viruses as well as actually disable viruses themselves ...and ALL he will discuss is drugs and vaccines, with just one alternative based on an old practice of injecting people with other people's immunity.  The latter is fine, but meanwhile he's outright allowing others to be in harm's way by refusing to talk about the natural alternatives that have been saving humanity from extinction...they're THAT powerful...at all.  It is fffing sickening.  How is this not a conspiracy build by pharmaceutical companies when the non-patentable alternatives with proof behind them aren't even mentioned.

That means that South Korea has tested 1 in every 170 people there. We've tested 1 in every 1,090 people in the US. SK's numbers have also dropped off significantly in terms of testing as they got ahead of it early. By March they were already at a capacity that they could test 140,000 people a week if they needed to. That's why yesterday they only had 146 new cases reported.

@FoxtrotMikeLimaXD,"I was on a business trip to Amsterdam and France. My wife was afraid of CV19.  When I got back, I felt like I got hit by a 2x4 and had a leather belt around my chest. Fever, fatigued, cough, etc...  We all quarantined.  I called my doc and told them everything. They told me “don’t come in, go to urgent care or the ER”. I called urgent care. They said to come in but wear a mask.  I DON’T HAVE A MASK. Who does? Maybe you have access to one at work, but then you infect everyone at work. You’re basically talking about DIY handymen. And the masks are all sold out. If I bought a mask at a store I WOULD INFECT EVERYONE IN THE STORE.  Anyway. I’m called by the urgent care manager that I can’t go to urgent care. I need to go to the ER.  Now... there’s a price difference between the local doctor, urgent care, and the ER. I almost said screw it. I wasn’t “that” bad off.   (Yay, USA healthcare system).  I went to the ER because I thought I was being responsible. I called ahead and had them quarantine me.  This podcast says do NOT go to the ER.  Okay, that was my only option.   Guess who DIDN’T get a CV19 test? This guy. I got a flu test, EKG, chest X-ray, etc... was that even necessary?   Who did get a test? NBA players, Celebs, and Politicians.  I’m TRYING as hard as I can to be responsible, but this system is so messed up. I put my family on lock down for 3 weeks. We don’t accept visitors (friends/family) because I’m afraid I’m (or my wife/daughter is) going to kill somebody.  Anyway, stay safe. I kind of lost my mind when Dr. Fauci said “don’t go to the ER”.

@intensifiedfailure," @vegancheetahvlogs  this man really just said CRISPR vaccines. Yep, vaccines clearly are related to CRISPR technology. Not like these are completely unrelated health technologies. CRISPR is using a modified enzyme from bacteria to edit genes. Vaccines use samples of pathogens to prepare your immune system for if you are infected. These things are not the same. It may be in the future where gene-editing technology is used to counteract the capability of a virus to attack our cells, but this in of itself is certainly can't be called evil. Hell, you could argue willingly letting people die in exchange for having the moral high ground of keeping genes unaltered is evil. Proposed viral defensive gene-altercations would have no visible effect on a human past immuno-response to humans (and with current technologies they really are only possible if done at birth), and if you're trying to argue that more effective ways to stop the disease is evil you can die on that hill alone. Besides, no one is truly proposing a gene-altercating medicine anyways. Odds are you have no understanding of the biology behind any of this, and just read the buzz word CRISPR and assumed he was working with major corporations to corrupt your one of a kind DNA when in reality most of the testing for this technology is being done in college labs run by professors on, at most, tissue.",5년 전,23,

You should be absolutely ashamed to call him a propaganda spreader or a “medical elite”, whatever the fuck that means. Regarding your point about CRISPR, the vaccine is still in stage one of clinical trials. It still has months of testing before even being considered for widespread use, and it is. quite possible that it will fail those tests. Informing people now about how the vaccine uses gene editing to fight the virus (if that’s even true) would just mislead them into believing that we’re close to a vaccine when we aren’t and confuse them.

@kelseymcguire4165,Interesting. The US is still doing daily testing to confirm you are no longer infected.

The ONLY thing the hotline does is tell people where they can go to be tested, that's all I'm doing. And if there's no where close at all where they can be tested, I'm now left holding the bag with a panicky person on the phone with little help to provide. I'm not a medical professional.",5년 전,0,

@aussiedrone1511,"To whom it may concern  The State and federal Government will have a lot to answer for if they do not take immediate action and put towns with a high indigenous population into strict lock down. If it gets into these populations they are estimating 25% mortality rate.   I live in Kununurra in the far north of WA in the Kimberley region. We are a very isolated town with a population of 6k to 7k, many of which are indigenous. We have limited medical services and even more limited medical staff. What staff, we did have are leaving to go home to loved ones or because they don’t want to be here when the virus hits because it would be like working in a war zone.   The local medical staff have been told that the expected death rate of the indigenous people in our area will be 25%. That is only how many people will die, not how many people will need medical support to survive. We have only 3 ventilators in town, a limited supply of oxygen, limited staff and PPE and approx. 100 beds in our hospital. How is this going to support a 25% death rate? The government knows this and still they won’t lock us down.  What are they going to do with all the dead bodies? We only have 2 morgue fridges to store bodies in, our funeral services are already flown in from out of town, the nearest cremation facilities are 1000km in either direction and our cemetery is not big enough, the local shire is scrambling to find another location.  Who is going to have to deal with all these dead bodies, will the community have to step in and fill the gap? Will my husband and teenage sons have to go on a body pick up??  Our entire town is screaming at our local shire to do more, to step up and show strong leadership. Our local shire are pleading with the State Government to allow them to do more but nothing is happening. The local shire can not do anything because the resources they need are owned by the state.   The state government has only just shut down the Kimberley region, but we already have 3 cases in this area. They need to do more. The government expects 25% of indigenous to die and it is not doing enough to stop it. How is that different to the holocaust? Their failure to act promptly has the potential to wipe out an entire race.        The entire town wants stronger lock down measure put in place. The effect of the virus will be extreme in our area therefore our proactive measures need to be extreme.   The Government thinks that because it has locked down all the communities that the problems has been solved. They haven’t locked down the towns. Towns like Broome, Kununurra, Halls Creek and Fitzroy. These towns have high percentages of indigenous people and these people are moving from town to town because they are all within the lock down area of the Kimberly. This area is too large and it needs to be made smaller.   All the boarding school kids that came home this week, before the lock down, are free to move around, as too are all the business people. This has increased our possibilities and it is only a matter of time before more virus cases pop up. We already have 3. We need more strict lock down measure and we need smaller areas to be ahead of the virus and stop it from spreading.   The alternative is just to devastating to contemplate…just think a 25% death rate….  I beg you to share our story, one that is faced by many remote areas in Australia. The government needs to be pressured into action.    Please help",5년 전,0,

It would be fan-damn-tastic to find a ""rule of thumb"" about self-isolating until you're something like 90% likely or better to be safe before going out again... being with people physically again.      Lots of us are GOING to be denied these kits no matter what we do or try. That's a fact... AND taking up the cash to get a kit ""by hook or crook"" could deny someone else (who desperately needs it?) the access when they could just have a sniffle or be coming down with something catastrophic without knowing it...       With the flu, for instance, common advice is ""If you don't have a fever, you're probably not contagious.""... BUT with Covid-19, that's not the case. Surely, around now, someone has a figure ""in the ball park"" that we can follow to do better than ""reasonably confident"" we're no longer contagious if we suspect we've recovered from this thing. I don't like the idea of accidentally spreading ""plague"" on people who might be immuno-compromised, at risk, or what have you... BUT maybe a crude guideline is better than nothing... I don't know... Something like ""Take 3 weeks out instead of 2 to be sure"" or ""Add two weeks past your fever's break""... and a person could reasonably consider forgoing the waste of TWO more swabs the rest of society can't afford to piss away... just to say ""yeah, you're fine.""  ;o)",5년 전,0,

One of them is on medical leave (unrelated to covid-19), so she can't work...but she can sow - so she volunteered to help with making reusable masks for health systems in our area.  She also volunteered her services as childcare for two of our workers who couldn't find anything, so they can be at work.   The director for our region has been meeting with us via teleconference daily to help coordinate and answer questions, and personally served as delivery driver of thousands of masks made by a retooled furniture manufacturer to help provide relief.   This was particularly moving to me, because I had one of my staff at my desk today, crying with guilt, because we have masks when others don't.  I had to walk them through exactly why masks have been allocated to our work (an on-going assessment as things develop).  We can kill our patients if we don't maintain our clean-room standards, or almost as bad, cause them to be hospitalized, adding burden to an overburdened system.

@bunbunnybunbun,"great that they were able to do this, even if the info was stuff I mostly already knew.    on another note, here's a mini rant cause I have no friends to talk to. so my aunts husband got put in the hospital, where it was confirmed that he had covid-19, and my aunt most likely has it too although she's home and seemingly stable (not tested but I mean they live together and sleep in the same bed). the hubby is fine, he most likely had to be hospitalized cause he's got diabeties type 2 and hadn't been eating properly. He's stable and his fever has gone down as of today, we kinda visited my aunt today and she was well enough to talk from a distance from inside, as well as walk around. this has nothing to do with anyone here, really, but I guess I just wanted to show that not all that get the virus die. He's most likely going to recover in time (they've already been sick for 2 weeks, probably from a hockey match they went to) and my aunt as well, seeing as they're healthy despite things. of course it could worsen but the hospital staff also seem optimistic.    anyways, I just wanted to try and spread a little bit of positivity. don't forget to enjoy the nice spring weather for a moment, even in the middle of all this chaos. we all need a moment of peace in times like this. eat some cookies and look at some nice budding flowers. hope everyone can have a good end to their week, regards from a tired hufflepuff",5년 전,0,

All I can do is block off a section of the house where he lives, wear a reusable, washable surgical mask at home and gloves and don't come into direct contact with him. Luckily we don't share bathrooms, and I changed my sleep schedule to use the kitchen hours before he has to and prepare meals ahead of time.

It is still spreading wildly out of control there they just do not care. The only thing they are doing is everyone there has masks to wear and we do not. They may have slowed it but it is not under control they claim they have no new cases from inside the country and only outside so they can use it as propaganda to blame other countries even more. Right from the start they blamed the US then they blamed Italy and Japan.  It is all propaganda  people need to stop repeating those lies as if they are true.,5년 전,0,

All the grocery delivery services are overwhelmed in our area and we're having to get by on delivery and whatever other ways we can get some food to our home. But again since there is no testing available we have to way to know when we are safe to go out and get real food. I guess I'm kind of just venting here, but I don't want to spread anything. I want to be responsible. But I can't get food for my family and I feel a great lack of help for those of us who are sick. I'm very privileged that I can't pay for expensive food delivery and my family doesn't have any dietary requirements that would make it harder for us to get food.

Could try a nebulizer treatment/albuterol inhaler, to hopefully open up your bronchials and alleviate that ""heavy"" feeling.

In fact it was the OPPOSITE. Their data only PROVED a connection between vaccines and autism and italy found them to be full of carcinogens.

@CarolReidCA,"Fauci's been a shill for 30+ years. Ask him any in-depth questions about any research and he may BS his way through it, yet true experts know better.   He knows healthcare administration, looks at other people's work.     Deborah Burks is working her rear end off and deserves a medal. She's more healthcare admin as well, and that's her position.  Fauci's been on, IMHPO, the wrong side of far too many decisions. He's not as negligent as the WHO, yet he's not far from it, in many cases over the last 20 years.   He was against even trying Plaquenil, until he was called on it by many in the research community. He's been responsible for our country's healthcare & especially research community being tied up in red tape for at least 30 years.    He would spend 5-10 years on research as thousands died if he hadn't been called out by the research community and the president. He cannot act in an outbreak. That's been repeated over and over. The last big one was H1N1.  He was protected, yet 17,000 people died.    Before you call someone an ""expert"", know what it is they've done in the past.    Fauci's done some good things, yet if it were up to him, again, many people would die, economies would collapse, people would starve before he actually made a decision.

@krusty9570,Now you need to ask him about new data concerning the pros and cons of shutting down schools and businesses!!! Stares are already not following cdc guidelines that clearly state not to shut down anything until there is significant outbreak in your community!!! And even then there are studies that question whether this helps either!! Shutting down things is different than social distancing which does work! What these models and what the cdc doesn’t discuss are the projections when we have to open back up business and schools!!! Luckily someone did this!!! What it says is shutting down does NOT prevent cases or deaths!!! Because there will eventually be a spike in this when we re-open!! Keep everything open and isolate the most vulnerable demographic as it relates to mortality rates!!! 98% of deaths come from 60 y/o and up who are immunocompromised!!! Isolate these folks and keep everything open!!

@jon_durham,"maranathaman you are the hero we need haha. Well said, I wish people would try to use this as an opportunity to come together as a country. I’d recommend watched timcast/ Tim pool, he’s a very good reporter that uses multiple sources, checks his bias, and uses a third party fact checker. The media really is disgusting, praising cuomo and condemning trump when they said the same thing about chloroquine. Pretty sure everyone sees Biden is slipping bad and they want to get cuomo in through a contested convention. People can come together tho if they’re willing to check their bias, like I don’t like cuomo’s politics but I think he’s done a good job in New York. Trump is having to do the same thing for the whole country, and he’s doing great. He was racist when he put in the travel ban, but now he’s downplaying the virus. Like you said, the media accused him of fear mongering and they said the flu is worse. Please people do your research and come to your own conclusions.

During that time he and the Surgeon General were doing everything they could to get the administration to recognize the disease and fund research into it. Fauci has members of ACT UP and other LGBT activists at his own home for dinner meetings so that he could get the message out and so that they could tell him things he otherwise wouldn’t know about the community and the effect and how likely people were to listen to medical advice. Fauci is just one really good dude,5년 전,0,
