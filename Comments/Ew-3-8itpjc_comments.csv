La pasta in Italia ha un origine ultra regionale. La stragrande maggioranza delle forme sono di tipo tradizionale, ognuna con una propria storia da poter raccontare, tramandate da nonne e mamme, non inventate in un qualche studio di design. Eppure hanno raggiunto lo stato dell’arte (perché noi riteniamo importante la bellezza, è un qualcosa che nutre il nostro spirito).

To answer your question, a single person can live a good life in the suburbs with 1500-1600€ per month in the North, maybe 200-300€ less in the South.

It's a mishmash of a bunch of different kinds of flour for me.  AP flour works just fine as well.  Really it doesn't matter, it's just some flour you use to make things workable.

@allanhenriques2694, @Albanez39  onions and garlic compliment tomato sauce very well,5년 전,0,
@Albanez39," @allanhenriques2694  Depends on the plate mate. Pomodoro e Basilico is made with onions (just a little); while All' Arrabbiata (alla ""angry"") is made with garlic (also a small amount).    I personally hate garlic when used in conjunction with tomatoes, except for the Crudaiola which is a cold plate (You don't cook the ""seasoning"") and uses garlic and cherry tomatoes.     I also prefer some Italian plates in my own way, e.g. using Parmiggiano on Aglio e Olio) and my father goes mad everytime I do that. My issue is that all of these American Youtube chefs are teaching people to cook the wrong recipes. They ought to get a culinary degree in Italian cuisine before they can be able to teach people how to cook...  Ultimately, onions, garlic, parsley, basil etc, are only used in MINIMAL AMOUNTS. They should add something to the flavour of the dish, but not completely overwhelm and mask the other ingredients.   If you want to cook Italian, make sure to watch a video made by an ITALIAN! Even for PIZZA, which is fairly simple to make...yet Americans have achieved to ruin that as well during the decades. The same applies to every cuisine; You want Mexican? Thai? Japanese? Then look for a Youtuber that was born and still lives in this country. Nowadays you can understand everything with auto-translated captions. Take care my friend!",5년 전,0,

@axjkalsok1058,"JazzyGemmi There’s no such thing. You can find ratios online, but the problem is that the it’ll be different depending on where you live due to the difference in humidity. Besides, part of the fun of pasta making is doing it by feel. Don’t worry too much about exact quantities, if it’s too dry, add some water, if it’s too sticky, add some flour. One thing I will say though is that making semolina dough is a lot harder than making egg dough, so you should start there if this is your first time.",6년 전,3,
@JazzyGemmi, @axjkalsok1058   Thank you. I have made pasta with egg from regular and wheat flour. That is why I wanted to try it with semolina. Can you tell me which brand to go with? Or what specification to look for while purchasing semolina?,6년 전,2,
@axjkalsok1058,"JazzyGemmi The bob’s red mill stuff should be fine. You can always go the extra mile and import some real nice italian stuff, but imo thats not really worth the extra money until you’re more familiar with the process. In terms of specifications, you’re looking for a very fine grain flour. If the flour isn’t ground fine enough, you’ll end up with a sort of sand rather than dough.",6년 전,2,

Are some of the designs unsuitable in a certain type of pasta because it wouldn't hold up structurally, or better in a certain type because it ought to be thicker or thinner or something?  Also, would love a video on just the different types of dough you can make, what sort of choices you have (could I make carrot dough and make noodles out of that? is there a mushroom dough?), how to adjust the recipes for the ingredients (e.g. would carrot dough need something to reduce the sweetness?), whether there are specific limitations with certain ingredients, how easy it might be to ""disguise"" veggies (for picky kids/hubbies) without losing the nutrition, etc.  And some details on the drying process for the noodles (I've heard that if you don't dry them, if you just cook them fresh, you don't get that al dente chewiness).",6년 전,0,

Unfortunately, there are problems with this theory, least of which is that the noodles they were making in China aren’t technically considered pasta. Polo also described Chinese noodles as being like “lagana”, which implies he was possibly already familiar with a pasta-like food before going to China. Further, in 1279, there was a Genoese soldier that listed in the inventory of his estate a basket of dried pasta. Polo didn’t come back from China until 1295. For those who don’t know, Genoa is a sea port in Italy. Further, the modern pasta like we know it was first described in 1154 by an Arab geographer, Idrisi, as being common in Sicily. So Marco Polo could not have brought pasta to Italy via China. It was already in Italy at that time.",6년 전,37,

@camillaf9522,"As I know it the history of Italian pasta dates back to the Etruscan population (we're talking about central Italy, X-I sec BC) and its tradition was later on passed onto Greeks and Romans. The pasta these populations were familiar with was laganon (in Greece, then developed into the modern ""lasagna"") and makaria (in Etruria, then developed into ""maccheroni"") and it was a mixture of flour and water. I also heard (but I'm not fully persuaded by this fact) that the first ones to have the intuition of making pastasciutta (literally dried pasta) were people from the middle east back in the Neolithic age and what pushed them was the fact that they didn't have full access to water all year long, being pastasciutta a food that can be stored for quite a long time once dried. Of course the noodle tradition is huge in China as well and is dated back to centuries ago but the process of making noodles is pretty different from that of pasta, that's why the most ancient and direct testimony we have of something similar to modern noodles, that goes back to 3800 years ago in Lajia, China, is considered not linked at all to the Italian pasta. Just wanted to add what I came across doing my researches :)",6년 전,5,
@raffaeleirlanda6966,"Camilla Ferretti: Dear Camilla, any populations that in history mixed flour + water in order to make wheat or corn or rice more edibile, sooner or later ended creating dough kneading this flour, and then they tried to cook this dough. Next step was to imagine a way to preserve this dough for more time, for example creating biscuits that last for weeks, cooking with spices like sesame (spiced bread) as long as spices are disgusting for insects and preserve bread from the mold, so again it ends resisting for weeks, or drying the dough and make dried pasta that lasts for months. Etc... Etc... Humans are intelligent beings. Just the fact Europeans had wheat not rice doesn't make them lesser intelligent than Chinese so then Europeans were such that dumb and unable to create dough and then again being uncapable of kneading and cooking it.",6년 전,0,

One of them is, that he never even mentioned the Big Wall in his tales or scripts, for example. Maybe his assertion having been to Beijing was a hoax? It is possible he once met Kublai Khan, whose empire was even much larger than today's China (huuuge!), somewhere in the region of today's Iraq, Iran or Pakistan, but there noodles are not common til now. Who knows. Maybe we will never come to know the truth...",6년 전,0,
@brucecanzoli3423," @spikebaltar5071  no this story is invented. The italian and chinese kinds of pasta developed indipendently from one another.

I have had fresh spaghetti in italy and it's beautiful and even had it in the states, but not sure how to make? I have tried to cut it thin, but it still is flat and taste more like a noodle. Also is spaghetti better with the egg dough or just semilina dough? When doing just the semilina dough, is that only meant to be dried, or can it be cooked right after forming?  Thank you",7년 전,0,

I do not want to do the usual proud Italian but the variety of cheeses, meats, sausages etc etc ... is impressive and changes within a few kilometers.

@pastanoodles00," @Spazik86   Plus there are many many recipes. All of which work wonderfully.   Genarro's recipe is one of my favorites. 150g double zero (00) flour + 50g durum wheat semolina + 2 eggs. Mix dry ingredients then add eggs in a shallow bowl or plate and mix with a spoon. Once it starts to come together you transfer to the table or a cutting board and knead it until it forms. If it's too dry, add liquid. Nothing fancy, just water works fine.  Yeah it's not rocket science but it's not an easy thing. It can be messed up with the slightest miscalculation. Each Italian family has a different recipe for their food. It all depends.

@atrumluminarium," @danpt2000  You are insulting the heritage of the entire Mediterranean region of Europe by calling them ""noodles"". The shape also effects the taste because their geometry plays a crucial role in determining how the sauce sticks to the pasta and whether it can hold filling or not. For example Farfalle and Penne hold on to a lot of sauce because of the corragations and the hole respectively, Tortellini and Ravioli can contain filling which the choice of can completely change the experience, etc.",6년 전,7,

In the video is fresh pasta (Lasagna, Tortellini, Ravioli, Pappardelle, Agnolotti etc) with different doughs; usually depends on region, for example in the north it's frequently used egg pasta while in southern Italy almost always the dough is just flour (or semolina) and water. Gnocchi are still different because are made with potatoes (and little flour). I know it seems strange for a foreigner yet each of these types are right for different sauces (it's not just the taste but also the texture that changes everything). Sry for my ""eng"", ciao.",7년 전,3,

@MrTinner66,"I do not think so, you're talking about a dish that has a few hundred years, since the term for Sardinian stuffed pasta comes from the Greek ""collyra"", so I do not think it derives from the Polish. The dish appears in 1811 in a list of Sardinian dishes. Moreover, Sardinia is an island and in ancient times its people lived for centuries isolated (even the Romans could not completely dominate the island). So it is a dish of a very proud people and linked to its culinary traditions, in a certain sense ""closed"", which will never put the dish of another nation among his. Your grandma's plate remains good, but nobody has copied anyone. N.B. for your info: from 2015 the ""Culurgiones"" are an IGP product (protected geographical indication) brand of origin that you can ""flaunt"" only if you produce it in the place of origin.",7년 전,2,

Maybe one of the spirals, or that little cup shape he rolled off of his thumb at the beginning.

@sonyarughani8420,Video captivated my undivided attention. It is well made  with good clear commentary.  What would have been great is more clear info of the dough making with ingredients & storage plus clear precise info on immediate usage of fresh pasta & storage / freezing.  Not everyone has so many pasta tools so info of what alternative tools can one use &/or info of where one can buy them.,7년 전,3,
