Clearly, you don't hate Muslims; you hate brown people!""  I've been the target of racist attacks aimed at several other groups - and I happily make fun of the complete and total idiots who make that mistake, and I make it clear to everyone around ""see, this person doesn't even know who they hate! They just hate random people for no reason! Claiming they hate [inserts group] is just an excuse to yell at strangers 'for fun!' That's pathetic!""  You get the picture! Now, to be clear, if you join in on the hate, that is indeed throwing the other group under the bus - and you are indeed just as bad (literally, you're doing exactly what the hateful people are doing)!  But yes, on that note, not only is it massively important to humiliate racists when they slip up, but it's quite messed up that we treat people who are profiled for the wrong stereotype as ""in the wrong"" for exposing that mistake and claiming ""they're throwing other groups under the bus.""

@DIM0ND12w,Nope. Turban is part of cultural clothing Punjabi Muslims wore them too. People from Haryana Himachal Rajasthan neighbour states of Punjab wore Turbans too.... Guru Nanak and every other Guru wore Turban as well.... The point of turban was to conceal Hairs...not to leave them open and later it became symbol of Sikh identity....that makes follower of Guru Nanak stand out ...,2개월 전,0,
@nicholasflammel2017," @DIM0ND12w  Do you like saying ""Nope"" without reading? I said the turban is not amongst the 5 K's of Sikhism which is true. So it does not matter if one wears a colourful turban to distinguish themselves from the usually monochromatic Islamic ones. Ofcourse it is a part of the culture of Punjab, Rajasthan, Himachal and almost all Indian states. Bengalis like Raja Rammohan Roy wore turbans and so did Nana Saheb and other Maratha rulers.",2개월 전,0,

Instead, Islam tells how to be patriotic for your Country and encourages to fight for it (In a right cause). Hinduism and Islam do come in same category of religion, but they are very different.  What you are wrong in is that you are taking your concept of religion and applying it to Islam so obviously there will be confusion.

In a society without a birth registry and where people did not celebrate birthdays, most people estimated their own age and that of others. Aisha would have been no different. What’s more, Aisha had already been engaged to someone else before she married Muhammad, suggesting she had already been mature enough by the standards of her society to consider marriage for a while.",2년 전,0,

People think she's between 9-19 years old. even if she was 9, it was normal back then. People were alot more mature at a younger age then now.  Also the prophet married her to protect her. In a society without a birth registry and where people did not celebrate birthdays, most people estimated their own age and that of others. Aisha would have been no different. What’s more, Aisha had already been engaged to someone else before she married Muhammad, suggesting she had already been mature enough by the standards of her society to consider marriage for a while.  1400 years ago it was normal to marry young girls. Even in Europe, 33-year-old King John of England married 12-year-old Isabella of Angoulême. Also Muhammed (peace be upon him) & Aisha had a beautiful relationship. He didnt mistreat her, Aisha loved him. She was happy with her marriage. Aisha was also a stateswoman, scholar, mufti, and judge, Aisha combined spirituality, activism and knowledge and remains a role model for many Muslim women today.

@AlaaBentWalid,"​ @farwaali3353 Okay, hold right there sister! Sahih al bukhari isn't wrong it's a book where the hadiths of what prophet Muhammed said and it's been collected into a book. Sure, there are weak hadiths and false ones, and that doesn't mean that all of them are wrong. We have something called Elm El Hadith, which translates to knowledge of the hadith. In which the scholars studies and every hadith of the prophet and if one among them was false or uncertain we label it as weak, or false if it was wrong. But the hadith about Aisha RA is 100% it is a strong one. But right now scholars found out that back then, a girl begin to say her age from when the puberty hits. Meaning, if a girl hits puberty at 9 then her age now is 1, they begin to count the age from the moment the puberty hits. And that mean Aisha RA was 19 when she married our prophet and not 9.

We cannot be real Muslims if we do not believe in the hadiths of our prophet because thus is his sunah, there's things that Allah didn't mention in the Quran straight away, instead, he teached it to our prophet and the prophet teached it to the Muslims, and it's been memorized and written down immediately. What Al bukhari did was that he only collected all the hadiths of the prophet in one book, so people don't have to go to a different place just to know about a few hadiths of our prophet. Al bukhari roamed the entire middle east collecting and choosing the right people that would be truthful in their words when they tell him the hadiths they know.

@AlaaBentWalid,"​ @farwaali3353 Where do you get your informations from?! Please, sister, educate yourself right. You cannot be a true Muslim if you did not believe in the hadiths of our prophet PBUH, because this is his sunah! His teaching to us. The hadiths is what made us learn how to pray and how many rakat is in each prayer. The hadiths let us know what to say before we go to sleep or wake up. The hadiths let us know what to exactly say before we leave the house, get in a transport, travel, before we wear clothes and many things. You cannot say that you do not believe in it, the prophet himself PBUH says to believe in the book of Allah and his prophet's sunah. These goes hand in hand you cannot believe in something and disbelieve in the other. Because, at the end of the day everything the prophet said was nothing but Allah’s teachings to him. The prophet did not say something out of nothing.",4개월 전,0,

@silliepooh," @Orioleexzz  I have no idea that it’s called a different name, besides calling it a Sikh Temple this whole time. Now I’ll have to google for gurdwara. According to googling and westerners, they’re called as Sikh temples, or a place for the Sikh to worship. The more precise term Gurdwara is the difference in how the building is built. Fascinating.  Of the many times I’ve been to the building, no one explained or corrected me. And my Indian friend didn’t even correct me either. Thanks for the info!!!",4년 전,3,

Perhaps if they themselves used the right term or educate us non Indian or Sikh religious people like me, we wouldn’t sound ignorant. Different cultures and religions have their own language. But I’m glad you didn’t think I’m one of the ignorant people. But I do feel bad for others who doesn’t better for being labeled as ignorant just because…  But too bad, I wish they have an English service someday so I would sit in. It would be nice to learn and be involved in a different religion besides my own.  :D",4년 전,0,

It branched out of Hinduism during the reformation period of the ""Bhakti Cult"" where people wanted to move away from the increasing materialistic and exploitative rituals prevalent in Hinduism at the time (like Jainism and Buddhism). Sikhism shares huge amount of parallels with Hindu philosophy. Calling Sikhism an independent religion is akin to calling Protestantism an independent religion.",4년 전,0,

@surgi-ical-striker,"the difference here is that Nuns takes a vow of celibacy. Meaning they will never get married nor have lovers in their life. Its kinda forbidden. Nuns are married to their christian faith. Regular Christian ladies are NOT forced to wear like a nun. Its by Choice or shall i say, by a ""CALLING"" that a christian lady chooses to live her life as a Nun.  A muslim girl however, wearing a Hijab can be ANY random muslim girl.She can fall in love with anybody. She did not take a vow of celibacy. But in a muslim society, when this muslim girl is not wearing a Hijab. They are normally frowned upon. Its not really by Choice actually. The religion does state for their womenfolk to dress modestly to cover up the skin. ITS written in their sacred holy books. So to against this is to go against the very religion you have faith in. THAT'S the whole problem right there.   Therefore, in many muslim societies it is kind of a FORCED thing actually. It really depends on the country you're being in. There are some muslim countries who are FANATICALLY following the religion by the book, and this does Cause a lot of problems. BUT there are also some countries who practice islam in a moderate way, so there is no FORCE on a muslim lady to cover up.   So yeah there is a BIG difference here you're not seeing. When a Muslim girl wears a Hijab, its by a slight force. Society may frown upon a muslim girl who does NOT wear a hijab but this happens only to SOME communities / countries.   There are many who chose NOT to wear a Hijab out of their own choosing and will.",4년 전,0,

@ashutoshjha225," @jedrzejdziadczyk8190 The Bible offers few clues about Christ’s physical appearance. Most of what we know about Jesus comes from the first four books of the New Testament, the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. According to the Gospels, Jesus was a Jewish man born in Bethlehem and raised in the town of Nazareth, in Galilee (formerly Palestine, now northern Israel) during the first century A.D.  We know Jesus was about 30 years old when he began his ministry (Luke 3:23), but the Bible tells us virtually nothing about what he looked like―except that he didn’t stand out in any particular way. When Jesus was arrested in the garden of Gethsemane before the Crucifixion (Matthew 26:47-56) Judas Iscariot had to point Jesus out to his soldiers among the disciples―presumably because they all appeared similar to one another.   For many scholars, Revelation 1:14-15 offers a clue that Jesus's skin was a darker hue and that his hair was woolly in texture. The hairs of his head, it says, ""were white as white wool, white as snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire, his feet were like burnished bronze, refined as in a furnace.”  Another rare early portrait of Jesus was discovered in 2018 on the walls of a ruined church in southern Israel. Painted in the sixth century A.D., it is the earliest known image of Christ found in Israel and portrays him with shorter, curly hair, a depiction that was common to the eastern region of the Byzantine empire―especially in Egypt and the Syria-Palestine region―but disappeared from later Byzantine art.   If you worship him because he is white then it's time you left your religion and be an atheist or something because then you have no problem discriminating if he ever comes to earth.",4년 전(수정됨),10,

Furthermore, it is provable that the Hindu Nationalist movement has created an anti islamic atmosphere in which it has become easier to go against Islam/Muslims.

@حسنعبدالله-و2ض,"Ich habe noch nie besser gesehen als der Apostel Gottes, Gott segne ihn und schenke ihm Frieden, als ob die Sonne auf sein Gesicht scheinen würde. Allahs Boten (Frieden und Segen Allahs) sind die besten in Aussehen und Charakter. Das Gesicht des Propheten, Gott segne ihn, und es gibt Frieden wie ein Schwert? Er sagt nein, es ist wie Sonne und Mond. Als wollte der Fragesteller wie ein Schwert aussehen, sagte er: ""Es mag wie der Mond aussehen, das heißt, es sieht aus wie ein sich drehendes, leuchtendes und funkelndes Schwert."" Ich antworte. Und wenn es bedeutet, dass seine Ähnlichkeit mit der Sonne als Ganzes scheint und wenn seine Ähnlichkeit mit dem Mond nur durch Navigation bekannt ist, bezeichnet es den Sonnenfluss in dieser Umlaufbahn als den Fluss von Hasan in dieser Umlaufbahn. ... Ich vergleiche Gesichter, Gott segne dich und gebe dir Frieden. Es ist subtile Schönheit, beruhigender Hautton, strahlend und beruhigend für das Gesicht. „Wenn es sauber und schön ist und eine gute Haut hat, Al-Rabbi Binto Mwad: Rasulullah, Gott segne ihn und seine Familie und gib ihnen den Frieden, der uns gepredigt wird. Beschreibe die Schönheit des Gesichts des Propheten (Frieden und Segen in ihm, Frieden in sich selbst und in seiner Familie). Einige zeigen die Pracht des Lichts. Allah gratuliert ihm und seiner Familie zum Frieden mit der Sonne und einige von ihnen vergleichen die Reinheit seines Gesichts. Der Prophet (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) sah die Schönheit des Menschen in seinem Porträt und Gesicht, er war wie Sonne und Mond, nämlich Stärke, Licht und Lichtreichtum besser als die Helligkeit eines Schwertes. . und glücklich damit. Das Gesicht wird so hell wie der Mond und Ma'am. Aisha, wenn Allah ihr gefiel, erklärte sie es ihm und sagte: Allahs Stirn, Frieden und Segen. Als ihre Stirn durch ihre Haare ging, schauten sie am Morgen Kinder und Jungen, als ra auftauchte und ihr Gesicht offen war an seine Stirn, als wäre es eine brennende Kerze. Stühle. Also ging ich zum Propheten und er saß um die Moschee und das islamische Mondlicht herum, wenn er wollte, dass sein Gesicht so aussah, als wäre er beleuchtet, als wäre er Teil des Mondes. Dann drehte er sich um und umkreiste den Mond, der sich über sein Gesicht gespalten hatte. Und Frau Aisha, möge sie mit Gott zufrieden sein, beschrieb sie und sagte: Stirn, Friede und Segen Allahs seien auf ihm, wache auf, wenn seine Stirn in ihren Haaren steigt oder morgens an einer Stelle erscheint oder einem Kind der Nacht, in der sein Gesicht den Menschen erscheint und sie dann auf seine Stirn schauten, als wäre es eine brennende Sattellampe. Die strahlende Stirn dominiert dieses schöne und majestätische Gesicht, geschmückt mit zarter Haut, mit einem glänzenden Gesicht und zarten Gesichtszügen, die an einen leuchtenden Mond erinnern. Wenn der Mond die Nacht zum Vollmond blitzt und auch von Aishas Hadith kommt, möge Gott mit dem zufrieden sein, der sagte: Der Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) war ein glücklicher Tag und sein Gesicht strahlte. -Rabi Bint Muvadh sagte: Gottes Gesandter, Gott segne ihn und gib ihm Frieden, erkläre es mir. Er sagte, wenn ich ihn sehen würde, würde ich sagen, dass die Sonne aufgeht. Als das beste Gesicht des Menschen leuchtete, leuchtete das Licht, und als der Wahrsager es sah, wurde ein Stück Mond als Erde berechnet. Aus all diesen Hadithen wird uns klar, dass der Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) ihm, seinem Herrn, die Schönheit der Erscheinung, die Stille der Stille, die Klarheit und Schönheit des Gesichts verlieh. des Fotos. Er, Gott segnete ihn und gab ihm Frieden, stand auf einem schönen Klumpen und einem flachen Morgengesicht, als wäre er in Silbermünzen geschlagen worden und hätte keinen Schimmer von Gesicht oder Licht. Keine Beschreibung hat es jemals beschrieben, sondern es mit der Sonne oder dem Mond mit dem Vollmond verglichen. Er verglich den Strom der Sonne auf seinem Weg mit dem Strom von Hassan in seinem Gesicht. Gott segne ihn und schenke ihm Frieden. Und der Prophet, der Prophet, möge Gott ihn segnen und ihm Frieden gewähren, es wurde bewiesen, dass er Gottes Gesandter, möge Gott ihn segnen und ihm Frieden gewähren, war das beste Gesicht mit hellem Licht. Und Ka'b ibn Malik, möge der allmächtige Gott mit ihm zufrieden sein, sagte: Der Gesandte Gottes, möge Gott ihn segnen und Frieden zu gewähren war, als sein Gesicht aufleuchtete, als wäre es ein Stück Mond. Ich sah den Gesandten Allahs mit den besten Gesichtern. Dies sind alles Beschreibungen des Propheten des Islam. Die Menschen mit dem besten Gesicht und die besten von ihnen in der Schöpfung Eine Frau hat Hajj mit dem Gesandten Gottes gemacht, möge Gott ihn segnen und ihm Frieden gewähren, und Abu Ishaq Al-Hamdani sagte zu ihr: Er verglich ihn mit mir. Sie sagte: Wie der Mond in der Nacht eines Vollmonds habe ich so etwas vorher oder nachher nicht gesehen",4년 전,0,

@XX-cp9jy,"I was born in a Muslim family. At childhood,I didn't even think that their can be atheism exist. When i first saw in internet that many people don't believe in religions,I was about to cry and my condition became seriously bad. But now,I believe in atheism. When i started thinking freely,then i found Islam is absolutely false. All the parts of Islam became false in my mind which were being believed by me for a long time. But,I can't express the truth to my family members because they'll kick out me from home. I have to pray every time with them and it is very much disgusting for me. But when I'll be an adult,I'll left Islam by law and so that people will recognise me as an atheist. Neither,my life will be meaningless and my future children will hate me for not leaving Islam. Now I understand that,Mohammed was not a mad,he was a clever liar. Arab was a land of illiterate then. Mohammed firstly realised that religion s are fake and he was finding a way to become famous and be remembered. At the age of 40,he successfully made a religion be following ancient religions. Then he cleverly spreading this by his friends and people like him. He made all the rules of Islam(like-a holy book,praying physically and mentally,the theory of life after death!etc) by following ancient religions. He then made a good number of followers by giving birth hundreds of children in a family(a normal servant of him had hundreds of children,then think,what will be the story of other peoples!)and then started to fight against innocent people and destroyed their religions. By doing these things Islam spread so fast. I can't think that how Muslims can be so much fool that they are still believing in that superstition(like-2,000,000,000!). Now I'll request to all of my Muslim brothers and sisters to not believe in Islam. Please think in a free mind. I know that it is so much hard because our family washed our brain from our birth. But it is possible because I did it. Andfinally,please leave Islam and so that others can leave it too. Lead a life like a real human,not like a beast that'll believe in everything. Please fulfill my dream.There are about 500,000,000 people(1/4 Muslim)are atheist but they are known as Muslims. Most of them are women. But,the miserably thing is that,only 1% of them leave Islam by law. The number is increasing so firstly because of Globalization and Internet connection. In 2050,there will be a war between Muslims and Muslim named atheists and we will win that. Mohammad said that,""every single man will born again and they will stood up at a ground faced at Allah. Each and every people will get the measurement of their deeds. Then,they will go to heaven or hell""-How stupid that theory is! How unscientific! Science said us that,""A human body,whose brain has been died,he will never get his sense again. GOD and ghost theory are deleted by science.Again,Muslims says that,""If there is no religion,then who made the Universe!?"" Science says,""Hey!come on man. Everything is being discovered by us day by day. This will also be discovered. But it doesn't make any sense that the GOD is addressed to us by Mohammad(messenger of Allah!) And you have to believe that.Muslims don't believe in science. They boycotted the Evolution theory. They says that the first man( named Adam!)came from heaven to the world. They don't believe in Dinosorous. Their history of 1,24,000 messengers is totally false and they have no provement.Muslims present leader Jakir Nayek is the most ignorant man I had ever seen. Once he said that,""Evolution theory is fake. It's just a thinking and has no proof."" That means,every theory of science is fake! The Big Bang is also a theory. Is that fake!?Muslims says that,Quran has all types of knowledge of the world! But,when I read that,I found nothing about knowledge. It was all about fake stories of believers and non believers. There were nothing written about geography, universe,medicine,internet connection,computer,history and what not? Listen,none but a beast follows a man. Mohammad was a man,I'm a man,you are a man,we all are man. Then why you will follow his words by your whole life and will even kill yourself! Religion is just a stupid theory which has no scientific value and was made by a specific man in a specific time in a specific land with specific orders. Just think,when science took place in the world with it's greatest speed,religion stopped to be made. But,the ancient theories are not ignored!

@XX-cp9jy,"I was born in a Muslim family. At childhood,I didn't even think that their can be atheism exist. When i first saw in internet that many people don't believe in religions,I was about to cry and my condition became seriously bad. But now,I believe in atheism. When i started thinking freely,then i found Islam is absolutely false. All the parts of Islam became false in my mind which were being believed by me for a long time. But,I can't express the truth to my family members because they'll kick out me from home. I have to pray every time with them and it is very much disgusting for me. But when I'll be an adult,I'll left Islam by law and so that people will recognise me as an atheist. Neither,my life will be meaningless and my future children will hate me for not leaving Islam. Now I understand that,Mohammed was not a mad,he was a clever liar. Arab was a land of illiterate then. Mohammed firstly realised that religion s are fake and he was finding a way to become famous and be remembered. At the age of 40,he successfully made a religion be following ancient religions. Then he cleverly spreading this by his friends and people like him. He made all the rules of Islam(like-a holy book,praying physically and mentally,the theory of life after death!etc) by following ancient religions. He then made a good number of followers by giving birth hundreds of children in a family(a normal servant of him had hundreds of children,then think,what will be the story of other peoples!)and then started to fight against innocent people and destroyed their religions. By doing these things Islam spread so fast. I can't think that how Muslims can be so much fool that they are still believing in that superstition(like-2,000,000,000!). Now I'll request to all of my Muslim brothers and sisters to not believe in Islam. Please think in a free mind. I know that it is so much hard because our family washed our brain from our birth. But it is possible because I did it. Andfinally,please leave Islam and so that others can leave it too. Lead a life like a real human,not like a beast that'll believe in everything. Please fulfill my dream.There are about 500,000,000 people(1/4 Muslim)are atheist but they are known as Muslims. Most of them are women. But,the miserably thing is that,only 1% of them leave Islam by law. The number is increasing so firstly because of Globalization and Internet connection. In 2050,there will be a war between Muslims and Muslim named atheists and we will win that. Mohammad said that,""every single man will born again and they will stood up at a ground faced at Allah. Each and every people will get the measurement of their deeds. Then,they will go to heaven or hell""-How stupid that theory is! How unscientific! Science said us that,""A human body,whose brain has been died,he will never get his sense again. GOD and ghost theory are deleted by science.Again,Muslims says that,""If there is no religion,then who made the Universe!?"" Science says,""Hey!come on man. Everything is being discovered by us day by day. This will also be discovered. But it doesn't make any sense that the GOD is addressed to us by Mohammad(messenger of Allah!) And you have to believe that.Muslims don't believe in science. They boycotted the Evolution theory. They says that the first man( named Adam!)came from heaven to the world. They don't believe in Dinosorous. Their history of 1,24,000 messengers is totally false and they have no provement.Muslims present leader Jakir Nayek is the most ignorant man I had ever seen. Once he said that,""Evolution theory is fake. It's just a thinking and has no proof."" That means,every theory of science is fake! The Big Bang is also a theory. Is that fake!?Muslims says that,Quran has all types of knowledge of the world! But,when I read that,I found nothing about knowledge. It was all about fake stories of believers and non believers. There were nothing written about geography, universe,medicine,internet connection,computer,history and what not? Listen,none but a beast follows a man. Mohammad was a man,I'm a man,you are a man,we all are man. Then why you will follow his words by your whole life and will even kill yourself! Religion is just a stupid theory which has no scientific value and was made by a specific man in a specific time in a specific land with specific orders. Just think,when science took place in the world with it's greatest speed,religion stopped to be made. But,the ancient theories are not ignored! Now the time came to kill this by ourselves and make proud ourselves to the future generation. My request to you is,""please,if you are a Muslim,then leave that by law and work for removing this superstition from the society. And if you are a non Muslim,then work for the same.""Thousands of children are birthing in Muslim families in every single second.

@firzanwolfred6112,"worst of all,  the try hard girls who dresses up all skimpy ends up not being attractive since they're all end up being no different than the other who tries so hard to get man's attention. Women In Islam is praised with their position high and when a man wishes to propose,  guess what? The woman decides whether he can marry her or not and she can make demands from the suitors if she so desires for it and the man must fulfil that wish and must follow the demands that she desires be it anything and if he fails, she can reject him.  Women have more power in relationships and has the power to chose who's worthy to marry them and knowing that many woman nowadays who aren't Muslims and are gold diggers, it's best to revert to Islam and just marry a man that would propose you and just make the demands as a wife is not expected to work as the husband will always be the breadwinner and the wife is allowed to spend the money the husbands provide that is with being lawful as not to be too jolly shopping to the point of extreme that is till bankruptcy which is frowned upon in Islam society but as should be noted, a wife's demands is the husband's responsibility to fulfill it and if he fails,  the wife has the power to demand for a divorce even for something like not satisfied in bed with the husband if the husband could not satisfy the wife while intercourse.

@firzanwolfred6112," @kaylam3288  I am not bringing down women, and if you think thats what I did im sorry for thats not my intention but with regards to why Islam states so for Muslim women to wear the hijab is more than just modesty, it is also a form of worship and moral and religious obligations for Muslim women. What I find funny is that most people argue about the hijab being oppressive yet thet never touch the aspects that involved men particularly about the part of clothing as well as men aren't allowed to wear silks or golden thread, tight skin clothings or tight shorts thingh length pants and not to dress something that is woman attires be it dresses or make ups. Islam is just plain and simple when you understand what it is and its not about how you interpret the teachings, but what you understand from it via those who are in authority of the subject, i.e Islam, ask a scholar, not the internet.  Also, I know that wearing the hijab is fussy because of heat or other form of environmental discomfort, as I always wear thick jacket with hoodie on and yet I chose to do so.

Edit: In contrast to that, if Hasan suddenly mutters the Syahadat which has Muhammadur Rasulullah in it, the ignorant people will explode like there's no tomorrow. See the difference in treatment toward our last prophet? He makes it funny/lighter in the mood by calling out Jesus instead as we all relate to him in some ways.

@huhisitreally," @monke3958  Just one tiny correction in Islamic belief about alcohol. Alcohol isn't bad for us until we consume it for the sake of being intoxicated & addicted, & that will always lead to sin, no exception. & there's other types of alcohol that isn't for consumption & Muslims don't avoid to use those. It's specific to the type of the things that should be haram (aka avoid) because of the major damaging side effects, that's all. We don't just think it's bad, it IS proven by science that drinking is bad in general, even if there's a few positive effects from it. So is smoking, & eating bacon, among many other general bans in Islam. They're all to improve your quality of life without straying from normalcy.  Anyway, as a side note, I'm just surprised that many Christians eat bacon despite Bible banning bacon for human consumption.

That explains why women in the Middle East gained more rights and had so much better than women in Europe in those first centuries.

Point is, no women will suffer if Islam is truly followed and not culture. I come from that kind of culture myself, I’m Turkish, and so many people like to put women down and claim that it’s Islam but I always prove them wrong saying that nowhere in Islam does it say you can disrespect a woman or that you are superior to a woman and can treat her however you want.",4년 전,2,

@AnuragDDethe, Anupam Datta Sarkar  Still it is sad considering the current fiasco that some Sikhs are being instigated to mass protest against the central govt.,4년 전,2,
@AnuragDDethe,"​ Anupam Datta Sarkar  You see, the thing is, with a democracy, this is simply the matter of the fact, you will not find any perfect democracy and neither is India. The grass always seems greener but democracy worldwide is like this. We have to accept democracy for what it is and one of the only things democracy gives is a minimum line of protection from the govt unlike any other autocratic form. The part of brainwashing is partly true but you shouldn't be so cynical. BJP doesn't do that nearly as much as many others do and do it to stay in power and while in power they have done a lot of good work, silently uprooting many socio-economic problems we have in India. Third, I would love to enter politics one day, I am a true patriot and I would rather see development of my country than coward for myself. The money part is true for most things but it isn't just about money, many things can get you into politics, if you get creative, anyone smart enough and willing enough to put the time can get into politics. When you ask if I like this state are you talking about the NDA or the Republic of India, the ROI is as dear as my life is to me and I currently support the NDA, they are not perfect but they are doing a good job. Also what kind of money are you talking of? If you are talking of taxpayers money then that simply goes into the national budget and is spent for the people, a lot of it is eaten up by politicians still but not nearly as much as the kind of centralized corruption done by UPA. Also, only complain if you are a taxpayer about your money because most Indians who should pay taxes don't pay  so they are equally big fraudsters as any other. The part of most being barely educated and being swayed is debatable but I agree a huge chunk of Indians vote for such things even today.  Again with the part of buying votes, not completely true, not all vote for daaru and money. They steal a good chunk of money, that is true, it is a human tendency to benefit themselves using a position of power because political selflessness is simply not biologically wired to your heads, chances are, if you were in that position of power, you too would. With the Trump and Biden part in some ways you are very correct and in some very wrong. I think Trump is quite incompetent in areas but he is best for India. The only competence Trump has shown has been in dealing with the corporates, like how corporations control a lot of US politics, he has been able to battle them because he knows the system being a big businessman himself, Modi has done partially the same but not with corporates but bureaucrats in India. The part of being objective is true and though we cant make the best democracy, we can at least try and improve it. I am quite objective in supporting the BJP and I have my reasons, most are regarding development rather than religion but religion does play a part due to long minority appeasement by Congress. I do welcome more political participation and I do understand that a lot of power can corrupt the best of us as the power goes to the head. I too want BJP to be on its toes but at the same time prefer their government. Sometimes making parties too politically weak can also have the effect of making govts that don't do anything for fear of bringing backlash, you must know how the 1990s went for India during the coalition era when a lot of progress could not be made just because the govt was too scared to bring reform after the already big 1991 reform. However, I spoke against the uprising because after seeing the bill, it seems good to me and this is just politics. It is not like such protests have not happened before, this is not a sign of political participation as most of these are political workers of parties or uneducated people being told this and that by the opposition. Most people don't understand the bill itself and speak what the opposition tells them to, this is just part of the gooning and swaying in the name of farmers that has been going on for decades. In a democracy it is extremely difficult to have the ""better, honest and kind"" leaders you talk of and simply, it is not the best either, in politics, the most honest don't make it very far, neither do the most kind do, if you think practically and want to actually do better then you will have to lie many times and you will have to be ruthless sometimes. This has been taught by the Mahabharata itself and don't take it religiously but as something to learn from. Even Machiaveliism has taught this f you are into western philosophy. Still I think it is safe to say that the NDA-Modi govt is better than the previous. I am open to a debate and you are free to discuss your views, thank you.",4년 전,4,

Sikhs wear turbans to protect themselves from head injury, since it was raised as a martial race by the most revered 9th Sikh Guru Hargobind Singh ji Maharaj to protect themselves from Mughals. Mughals were forcing Sikhs to convert to Islam. Sikhs were brutally massacred by Mughals, hence they started to live as a martial race. They had long hairs so that they could wear heavy turbans to protect themselves from head injury during battles. Guru Tegh Bahadur was forced to accept Islam, when he declined his young child was killed infront of him and his liver was forced into Guru's mouth. And when even after this he declined to accept Islam, his was beheaded. This angered his son the 10 th Guru Hargovind Singh and he raised the Khalsa Panth in which 5 Ks were necessary and it was the martial wing of Sikh religion.

@AAAAAAA66879,Kiwi Kiwi well it’s not my point it’s the point of that video. That (many) Americans don’t know anything about things they should and that this ignorance ends up in offensive racism. So you are irrelevant in this. I know what a Sikh is too while most of pple around me don’t. Now my point is: it’s normal. It’s not one of the major religions in population or in area it covers so people don’t know and mistake them for Muslim. What’s the big deal? Of course it would be good to know more about things. Anyway I guess my real point is : america should change it’s name into “Offendia”. Two advantages: 1) it’s culturally more accurate 2) it allows to walk away from a name of country that was linked to slavery. Of course all this is to be done in a big apologizing ceremony 😂,5년 전,0,

These type of people are highly aware of what is going on . Though I am not an atheist till now but I also have some different perspectives of life that are different from others .

@ArashiNoAtoNiji,"@Alan Deutsch Dude, the comment isn't 'shifting blame' onto Chinese people. Chinese people are unjustifiably targeted because of the pandemic and other East Asians are experiencing misdirected racism because racists don't know anything and want to vent their anger on a group of people because it's easier than lashing out on governments. There is no implication of shifting blame to Chinese people. The whole video is about people who are experiencing misdirected hate and that hate is illogical and EVEN affects people who aren't the target group. The comment just sheds light and lowkey jokes about Asians who aren't Chinese are also affected by this pandemic racism. Do you realize how dumb you sound forcibly victimizing Chinese people while disregarding other East Asians' pain? You sound like a wumao lmao.",5년 전(수정됨),7,

Also, about fashion, headscarfs comes in 2948229823 number of designs?? Also, you're still allowed to wear anything ( covered ) but just with a headscarf.

So I was talking to the guy and he showed me his shrine and broke it all down for me. But my dumbass coworker kept wanting to talk to the guy about Islam and doing his damnedest to draw parallels between the religions, essentially refusing to acknowledge Sikhism as it's own distinct religion. I was mortified by the fact that my coworker was being profoundly racist but at the same time in awe of just how cool the gentleman was about it.

He was not happy that we had to take his dagger, but even more so when my supervisor asked him to take off his turban. I had to jump in and calm him down saying I will personally give him back his dagger when he leaves the park and it will be in a safe, also I reminded my supervisor that our policy does not require people to remove religious headgear before entry nor do we ask people wearing ballcaps and such to take them off before entry either.

No it does not.  And so I simply pointed out that Faith comes from within you.  You can still pray, worship, talk to God.  All of this “stuff” is just DOGMA.

@alexandrahenderson4368, @Mostlyharmless1985  the United States and the rest of the Americas is Native American land. The people who are non-native that live here don't deserve the land.

@alexandrahenderson4368, @Mostlyharmless1985  to say there is no American is incorrect. Because Native Americans still exist in English the continents are called the Americas. Therefore the native inhabitants should be the only ones called Americans. White people black people Asian people oceanic people aren't American. They're colonizers or refugees.

@alexandrahenderson4368, @Mostlyharmless1985  they'll agree with me. Why? Because as a Native American I know what the majority of our community stands for because I'm involved with it quite often. The seminole know that white people forced their grandparents and great-grandparents into reform schools nearly lost every aspect of their language and their culture because of it and then lost their lives because of white supremacy. But tell me how they'll slap sense into me for believing that Native Americans own the land. it seems like you're the one that needs to be slapped. Because you clearly believe that colonizers own land that they stole if you steal something it's still belongs to the rightful owner it doesn't matter how long you've had it it's still stolen. White people stole the land it doesn't matter if it's been 400 years it's still stolen it still belongs to the rightful owners. But as you are clearly not a Native American you don't quite know anything about us nor do you try and yes you do support white supremacy and white colonization because you think that they just own everything. You don't see them for the literal thieves that they are. Or was it the fact that I said that Native Americans except refugees? because there been many accounts of Native Americans taking care of people they believed were refugees. the only difference between the refugees that Native Americans helped and the refugees at the US wants to help is that the refugees that the Native Americans helped killed them right afterwards. Whereas modern-day refugees haven't been killing and replacing people's cultures. Funny how that works.,4년 전,1,

@Mostlyharmless1985," @alexandrahenderson4368  point of order: the only native people who live on my land were the Timiquan who have been gone for nearly a thousand years, so, who’s land did I “steal” exactly? Fact of the matter is, I have more claim to it than any Indian ever has. “We were here first” doesn’t apply. Because “here” was under 3 feet of water and there was no land to speak of when there was any rightful claim against the “colonizers.” like I said come chat with the tribe down here so they can slap the stupid out of you.  The Seminoles haven’t ceded any of their territory and the Oklahoma seminoles are a distinct political organization born of captured people kidnapped by the US government.  Fact of the matter is, I bear no relation to the people who fucked the Indians off their territory and I won’t cotton to accusations that I had anything to do with it.  The seminoles have never signed any treaty with the US and it is a point of pride to them that they have never been displaced. They are still here. The “other” Seminole tribe lays claim to the entirety of Florida, which is an untenable and childish grab at victim hood that is seen in rather poor light. Even in their own time the Seminoles were made of hundreds of disparate tribes in loose coalition. I would encourage you to look into the Seminole wars because the Indians put a right beat down on any motherfucker who stepped to them, and gave the US its first Vietnam experience.  Unless are in full reality denial, white people are here, and they will remain here, and there isn’t a damn thing anyone can do about it.

In a society that values individual freedom above all else, people like to deal with other individuals, so if behind an individual is a group that influences that individual's behavior, now it becomes uncomfortable. Groups plan things, that's how they last. So who am I talking to exactly, and what are you people planning?  It's no different than coming to a casual party in a business suit. There's nothing wrong with wearing a suit, but, like... what's with you? And what are the chances that you'll make the party uncomfortable? Nobody wants to have to deal with you.

If the society treats them as suspect, demanding that the society change may be morally righteous, but it's unlikely to change anything. You can't wear a uniform AND expect that people see it ONLY in a positive light.   You look outside and see rain — you take an umbrella when you go out. Go without and demand the rain to stop, and you'll only look silly. And by all means, if you believe that the system can change, do try to change it.

@TheOffkilter, @usenan  Well the implied part was that they were afraid of him because they thought he was a Muslim(which was and is common still). Islamophobia is absolutely wrong and ignorant which I suppose I shouldve made that clear( although I also would wish that also was implied). But at the time I certainly didnt have the time or interest to have THAT conversation with my boss and coworkers.,3년 전,2,
@usenan," @TheOffkilter  thanks for clarifying your opinion and appreciate your honesty. I think Islamophobia is the result of most Americans not knowing about other cultures and religions and the Western media plays a big role in smearing the Muslims whenever they can by adding the Muslim word in front of a terrorist (when a terrorist is a Muslim but you will never see them say a Christian terrorist in any news if the terrorist is a Christian). So the aim is to associate terrorism with Islam whenever possible. I think people in the USA need to get educated and not trust and judge anyone or generalize a whole religion by few people's actions. I lived in the USA for 2.5 yrs during the '80s and hatred towards foreigners were no different then what it is today. The day we arrived there, we were attacked in front of our house by a group of youngsters and these type of attacks/insults continued all through our period there unfortunately. This is the reality of the culture there.",3년 전(수정됨),1,

@mak_1802,"Jay Joshi You mean this verse:  “And when the sacred months have passed, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, let them [go] on their way. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.” (Al Quran 9:5)  ???  ! OK, so here is what I need to inform you about this verse. First, to understand a Quranic verse, you need also to be acquainted with the Arabic history of the time when Islam came. This verse was revealed unto Prophet PBUH while the Islamic followers were engaged in the Battle of Tabuk. The battle was fought as a retaliation against the buildup attack on the city of Madinah by Byzantine Empire in the year 629.  It was also one of the first successful expansions of Islam in what is supposed to become a series of capturing major Arabian cities. Now, coming to the central aspect of the verse. The verse orders Muslims to fight those idolaters (and also those hypocrites who are the enemy within) when the sacred month is passed because fighting in a holy month is not allowed.  The Byzentiniam force consists of many Arabian allies in those regions that were pagan or either some people of the book as well (Christian, Jews) who are fighting alongside the forces of King Heraclius of Rome to demolish growing Muslim influence in Arabia. So, God ordered Muslims to fight those people so that Muslims may not be outdone and be killed or their tribe eliminated along with the prophet. The fight was a defensive one.  Now, in the last focus of this ayah, God also orders Muslims that if among the enemy, anyone who repents and eliminate the intention to assault Muslims, and better if they pray and give zakah (charity to poor), then the Muslims are not allowed to have any evil intentions against them as well and or find means to fight them at all. God is without a doubt merciful and loves forgiveness",5년 전,85,

@x_zampaneze_x9750,"Just wanna say as an American, we do not hate Muslims, or any who practice Islamic Faith. However as a nation that tries to protect against oppression, discrimination and religious discrimination (It literally says, ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion"" in the 1st Amendment) we do see issues with our youth having religious teachings forced into their brains. Especially with text like, ""Now go and strike the Infidel and devote to destruction all that they have. Do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.” Surah 27:63 Now...... I don't know about you.........but that feels kinda like hate. Maybe stop watching Trevor Noah, he's clearly leaning towards a side politically that is for a racial divide in a country that wants no part of those games. I also want to point out this video appears to be filmed in and around Time Square NY. A vastly Democratic state, and a state that places 22nd in education......  And not once in the video did it show American's hating Muslims, or Sikhs. Sure an individual at TSA did, but assuming 1 person can be speak for the other 328.2 million (as of 2019 Census Bureau).

Youtube deleted my past comment when I tried explaining it to you, but here's a better explanation to that verse.   This verse is specifically discussing mutual battle with those disbelievers engaged in warfare as noted by Ibn Jareer al-Tabari [12]. This is clear from the opening line of the chapter which states, “Those who disbelieve and prevent people from the path of God“, which as Ibn Abbas has stated, is in reference to the pagans of Quraysh [13], who oppressed the believers by denying them the freedom to practice their faith and then went to war with them to exterminate their community.  Basically, you misunderstood the verse. You put it out of context. The verse was explaining that muslims need to defend their right to practice their religion from the pagans that were denying that right from them.  You should do some real research to understand the true meaning of text. This is a common misconception about islam. In NO WAY does islam promote attacking innocent people for their beliefs.

Racism is nearly destroyed the only people like you who constantly talk about other people’s race. Most people don’t care people like you are obsessed with race. You talk about police brutality look up the actual data on police brutality it’s almost nonexistent. The chances of someone being killed unarmed while being pulled over by the police is very small last year. Last year 9 unarmed black men were killed in America 6 of which we’re running away from the cops and two we’re driving cars at the cops trying to kill them. There was one case where a black man was unjustifiably shot by the police and that officer was charged with murder. You talk about abortion how is it anyone’s right to kill an unborn child simply because it’s existence is an inconvenience to you. Why do you get to decide weather something has the right to live.

@coolworld9731,"So depressing to face ignorance, fear, bigotry and stupidity just because you look different. Ignorance is first on my list because it allows the rest on said list to happen and fester and gives the illusion it can infect the Majority. It doesn't, racism is a minority in most countries, yet the few are still sufficient in numbers to make any Minority look much smaller in numbers and manage to sneak into positions of power and make racism systemic...thus feeding the exact same feelings in few numbers in said Minorities, it breeds hopelessness in most, anger in a few. The few angry ones will react the strongest and we all know how. Let's make sure the few bad ones can't speak for the rest of us the Real Majorities, but they're the ones arming themselves and are crushing all of us, and calling honest journalists Fake News so that we lose the only weapons we have : our voice and our right to see the real truth and our ability to judge fairly. Vote while you still can. See who's marching in the streets for all and hear how those few twist it. Protect those who try to fairly report it and denounce those who don't. See the incompetence of those in charge when facing real danger such as a pandemic, they deny it and move to other issues they created .

@yuvrajsinghbajwa8039,"The reason sikhi isn't more popular is because there's no active way of converting people. In sikhi we do not believe in trying to convert other's to our religion. It's all about quality over quantity. And even if someone's from different religion, we don't say- oh we are better than you come join us. No that's the exact opposite what we say. What we actually say is - oh alright cool that's your religion, teach  us more about it. We're supposed to learn about other religions too. Not just about sikhi. We want the Hindu the Muslim the christian. To become the best hindu the Muslim and the christian that they can be. That's what it's all about. Because we all take different paths but we are still getting to the same end, which is god. And that's why in sikhi you are not allowed to convert people you are not allowed to tryna  pressure them to convert and say that hey if you convert then we will give you this house hey we will give you money. No we are all equal. There's not insentive like that. Anyone can become a sikh. But you don't have to be a sikh. That's the main difference.",5년 전,0,

Especially if he goes around preaching ""love for all hatred for none. "" He would be put in jail interrogated or if he luckily misses the arrest he would have to run back to Palestine and seek refuge with poor and needy.. we are so blind now that even if he walked among us we would not see the light coming from his face.

@codeplaysgames7681," @jayjoshi9821  Dude, it proves nothing. I don't go about degrading Christianity or any other religion, because I have no education on those religions, what I do have knowledge on is Islam, and the Verse you want us to listen to is beautiful, it shows that we will not compromise on breaking the treaties. That verse tells the event in which the Quresh of Arab made a peace treaty with Muslims saying that they can practice Islam in the city of Medina and do trades to middle-east and Europe and can spread religion peacefully, it was supposed to last 10 years, and in Medina people celebrated for a peace. But Quresh broke the treaty when they joined forces with other tribes to kill any Muslims in their areas. Prophet Muhammad(PBUH) upon seeing this took a small force and people did Jihad( Jihad means helping and fighting for Islam but as defensive not offensive, it means to give what you can for the better cause, ISIS and other murderers/terrorists have misguided the west on what Jihad is) then they marched on Mekkha, a battle was fought where a small number of Muslim forces defeat an enemy 10 times larger, God then revealed, and the true meaning of this verse is that, seek peace. If someone breaks a peace treaty(someone declares war) you strike back and make sure they never do such a horrible event again.   Kind sir, please do research, you seem like a person who would believe anything, I mean if I say Muslims are now the majority in the US, you'd believe it, I say Sharia law is Islam, you'd believe it(for those who are afraid of sharia law, its mainly implemented by Shias, and shia will never be the majority in west, nor would Sunnis in fact, second its a law, it's not a part of religion, it was made based on the typical Muslim life according to shias, so don't worry.     I summed up a lot of topics here, if you have any question feel free to ask me, I'd try my best to reply. Remember we are all Humans at the end of the day, doesn't matter if we are atheist, Muslims, Sikh, Hindus, Buddhist, Jews, Christians and so on. Let's spread goodness and hopefully aim towards peace, it is the only option to thrive.    Notes: Yes, Muslims, mainly Arab countries have declared wars, but that's human nature not Islam or other religion in fact. I wrote this in hurry, there might be spelling and grammar errors, so please bear that in mind before replying with ""You can't even speak English"". Bye bye.",5년 전(수정됨),4,

Together, with each other's help, we can deal with these groups and show them that no matter who you are, no matter where you come from, at the end of the day we are all HUMANS.

Even liberal schools teach this.",5년 전(수정됨),0,
@chucknorris9667," @bowser3369  well that's what they teach you. That doesn't mean it's true though. History has been changed a lot from what actually happened. An example of this is what they say about spain: they teach you that the islam conquered almost whole spain in only 7 years with the fastest way of traveling being horses. This is obviously not true, how would they conquer that whole territory in so little time when even the Roman Empire couldn't do that in 30 years? What really happened is that people in spain actually started to become muslims themselves and that's how islam spread so fast. Now if you want to believe this or not, it's your choice. Of course there will be people who do horrible things in the name of a religion despite the fact that what they are doing is completely wrong in the region. One example of this are the terrorists. Sorry for the long text XD",5년 전,2,
@bowser3369," @chucknorris9667  Ok, even portrayed in the best light, everyone knows Muhammad had an army that he took his hometown with. It's a fact. Look in any history book, ask any history professor and they will tell you that. If Islam is a peaceful and tolerant religion, why was their leader taking his city with an army when they didn't convert? Furthermore, why does Quran 9-5 say you should kill polytheists unless they convert? Don't say it's fake because if you google it, it will quote it word for word from that website.",5년 전,0,
@chucknorris9667," @bowser3369  he had a army because there where people that didn't want that religion to spread so of course you need to defend yourself. Also the quote you see there in the link, if it's not fake, then it's incomplete. Also muslims didn't kill any person that wasn't a muslim, a proof of this is the fact that in muslim societies, there were also other religions like jews. It's in the book that we have to respect other people's opinion and religions, we can however talk to other people about the religion, if the person is interested or not it's her choice and we have respect that. (sorry if my English is bad XD)",5년 전,2,
@bowser3369," @chucknorris9667  To be clear, he USED the army he amassed to INVADE the town. These are words from my liberal, muslim loving professors. It was not for defense. Additionally, non-muslims in the muslim empire were treated like second class citizens and taxes heavily. Often this was not a monetary tax, but sometimes it involved taking people's children to join someone's harem or be someone's soldier. Again, this is from my muslim loving professors who somehow came to the conclusion that though they had this behavior, muslims were tolerant. I'm not even mentioning other sources because you would probably call them fake, even though the quran is the most direct source you can get, and if you bothered to read it you would see that quran 9-5 is not some incomplete snippet that I tried to manipulate.",5년 전,0,
@chucknorris9667," @bowser3369  again i can tell the same, history has been changed a lot. It's forbidden to use violence unless it's for self defense. And harems aren't allowed either. And pedofilia is probably the worst crime you could do. But then again, not everyone who ""was a muslim"" really cared about this. I'm not saying your teacher is lying, it's just that history has been changed a lot of what actually happened. Then again, if you want to believe me or not, it's your choice.",5년 전,2,
@bowser3369," @chucknorris9667  First of all, Muhammad himself is the only Muslim I'm citing here. He had multiple wives, and the Quran itself and Islamic history describe them as beautiful women. Basically he had his pick of women, a Harem. He also did have real conquests, the first being the one upon his hometown. Even Islamic historians will tell you this is true, and the Quran itself, as you see in Quran 9-5, incites violence that is not for self-defense. Don't say ""real muslims"" don't do that because Muhammed was the very first one, and made the religion.   Also your arguement that ""history has changed a lot"" is completely invalid. First of all, I could claim the same about Hitler and call him a benevolent lover of jews, and cite the same excuse as you to people who disagree with me. Also everyone knows what I've said is history, and the only ones who've been changing history are leftists trying to portray it in the best possible light, the same people I'm citing to debunk your arguement.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

In your second most recent comment you said he invaded his home town to stop conflicts in the region. How is this self defense?

Also why would I watch the movie when you just summed up why he did it and the movie by telling me in the comment?  Also, if the Quran obviously says (as it does in Quran 9-5, please actually check that out, I'm tired of reiterating this. Just look in the following text if you think I'm cutting parts out) that violence is usable against polytheistics, and Muhammed OBVIOUSLY used force upon people without a physical provocation (which is what you need for it to be self defense) where are you getting this uncited belief that violence is something muslims loathe so much?",5년 전,0,

@bowser3369," @cristinaalbuja5093  The way you worded that question and your previous statement seem to suggest that you are saying ""my country's not perfect, but at least we aren't as bad as those racist Americans in the U.S.""  First of all, every country in South America is nowhere near as diverse as the U.S, so obviously the number of racial incidents would be significantly less. Additionally, you experience it as one of the majority (correct me if im wrong,) so of course it's easier for you not to see any racial incidents. Instead what you see is the United States, a country being divided because one side is trying to manipulate and blow facts out of proportion, and you assume, despite not having experience, (again correct me if im wrong) that we are a racist country when we are the only one to have a civil war for a minorities' freedom, and the first to have states give women the right to vote.",5년 전,0,
@cristinaalbuja5093," @bowser3369  well im sorry that you undestood that... thats not what i meant. I think youre looking for things to get mad at. What i actually meant from my first comment is  that people from the US have somehow taken  the name of an entire continent to name themselves as if it were a country, just like you did in both of your previous  comments. Its something  that bothers  me because no other country  in the world has done  that and last time i checked there are 6 continents, not 7. I know not everyone in the US thinks like  the people in this video, so its obvious that not all of the people in the entire continent of America  think  like them  either. Thats all i meant. And you are right, theres actually a lot  of xenophobia in my country specially against people from Venezuela. However, my country is not a world power like the US,in fact  it is a third world, underdeveloped country, meaning that we dont have nearly  as many  resources as the US, so when  people  migrate to  my country, there  isnt an issue  with  the color of their skin or their nationality, the problem is  that there arent enough jobs  or resources for normal citizens, even less for migrants. This doesnt mean that i justify their way of thinking but  that i kind  of understand where they are coming from and its just not the same in the USA, where theres plenty  of resources and the quality of life is much better with or without migrants.",5년 전,1,

This is unfair but nothing to do with race. david is like the 28th most common name in the usa! dante on the other hand about 1500th. now the point here is this variable was ignored just like all the other possible causes because the goal was to prove racism exists rather than find out the truth. The methodology was poor basically. It also assumes no random chance took place. heres one. did you know a judge gives lighter sentences after lunch? and not by a little but by a lot. maybe the person had lunch or went hungry. social science is not yet science so as a rule of thumb if it comes from social science it will not have proper data to back up the claim. One day i'm sure it will get there but it has a long way to go. For questions along the lines of social science you are best to look at psychology which has better more robust data. You are right about the poor. Heres the thing. Its a fact about THE POOR, not the black. So target therefore the poor. If it were the poor and you target the black then you are racist, plain and simple. I assume you aren't. People are individuals. That is the unit to use.

If you break a leg there and are uninsured you have to pay 10000$. With insurance 2000$. In most European countries 0€.

I'm pretty sure what you mean to say is, ""Some countries can't handle people of other races, therefore we should ignore the issue and indulge the racists in their bigotry. After all, we don't need to solve a problem if we act like it doesn't exist.""",5년 전,0,
@reddpoint3788," Khorne's Missionary   A man managed to kill another human being with a sniper from a distance of 3,540 meters away. The person's life would be taken in the blink of an eye, and they wouldn't even be able to see their killer. I am 100% certain you can't do that with a hammer or screwdriver.   A gun is designed specifically to kill things. They are used to kill things quickly and from a distance. A hammer is used for construction. While you can use a hammer to kill someone, they aren't designed to do that. You could kill someone with almost anything. You could even kill someone with water. However, that fact did not stop humans from making guns.  Also, people don't kill people. People with guns kill people.",5년 전,0,
@reddpoint3788," Joe Edwards   Okay, so you're one of the types of racist that believes in the whole ""Great Replacement"" theory then. So, I have a couple things to say.  Firstly, we have borders so that we can run the country with the type of government we prefer, not to keep people of other races out. I'm sure you wouldn't like it if we had a cruel dictatorship like North Korea.    Secondly, people migrating to another country isn't stealing. One of the main differences between the two being that migration is legal, and theft is not. Nothing is being taken away if a migrant comes to the country.   Thirdly, your theory is shit. If a majority is going to become a minority because of migration, nothing but the status of being called a majority is lost. No people have died, thus meaning that the population of the majority hasn't decreased. The ratio has simply changed.  Fourthly, white people won't go extinct because of migration. But let's go along with this whole ""Great Replacement"" of yours and say that white people actually have gone ""extinct"" because there are no more purely white couples, and that now there are only interracial people now.  Who cares**?  If white people ""go extinct"" because the person they loved was of another race, so be it. There isn't any sort of racial superiority that we need to protect. It's not like humans are an endangered species. The only reason you would ever suggest needing to protect the white race from extinction in this way is if you're a racist.  There is no moral problem with letting foreigners into our country, unless you're a racist.",5년 전,2,
@reddpoint3788," Joe Edwards   So you don't want schools and crap to be segregated, but you also want foreigners to migrate too quickly because they would dilute the white population.  You aren't racist, but you believe that whatever the natives are should be the majority of people, and should protect that racial majority by any means.   You are the most self-contradictory racist I have ever seen. As for what you said about other races having a higher birthrate leading to a resulting decline in white people, that is called the Great Replacement theory. A theory used by racists to close borders because of a fake threat they made up.",5년 전,0,
@reddpoint3788," Joe Edwards   Because Ukraine would like to have it's government the way they want to run it. Even if it was because of race, we don't actually need to follow their lead. I'm not sure if you know this but the reason the Revolutionary War happened was because the colonists were fed up with the previous government. So they decided to take whatever land they could, and make the government the way they wanted it to work. A prime example of my argument.  Also, which Korea? I don't know if you know this but there are two Koreas. It split in two when America wanted to push it's political system into Korea, at the same time Russia wanted the same with it's political system. I'm not sure if you realise that the Koreas are yet another prime example of my argument. Korea was literally split into two halves because each country wanted to run the place with it's own system of government.",5년 전,0,
@reddpoint3788," Joe Edwards   Culture doesn't live on through race. It lives on through practice and knowledge of people.  You say you are not against immigration, but you are against open borders. While the two aren't completely contradictory, they still don't fit well together.  You say you want people to merge, but you are against them merging if it means the native population decreases relative to the migrant population. Those also do not work together.  Lastly, I didn't call you fascist. I called you a racist, because you are using racist ideology to perpetuate a the racist myth that a people can die out if the birthrate is higher in another people's race. The racist myth that is used to scare racists into hating migrants.   Also, Hitler started WWII with the intent to conquer Europe to benefit his native race. While it isn't the same as conquering the continent, you practically are suggesting the same thing. ""Let a different people suffer a difficulty to preserve the native race"".

@ernestb556," Joe Edwards  so what you're saying is you're okay with ethno states that create divides in communities? When you say ""europe is for the Europeans"", you're meaning to say white, arent you? What about all the minorities that have called those regions home for generations? It's funny that you think segregation creates love. Splitting people apart by the color of their skin and other characteristics they have no control over isnt just rediculous, racist, and idiotic, but the complete opposite of what you want to achieve. Letting people experience other cultures and letting them live amongst them is a much better way to understand your fellow man than looking over at them like they're some sort of ""other"". Please rethink your ideology, because segregation and ethno states wont work and will cause hate, its harmful to humanity as a whole.",5년 전,0,
@ernestb556," Joe Edwards  I think its rediculous to claim that immigration is killing a culture. It's not like people moving into another country are REPLACING those citizens, simply, they live there too. What do you label as a country's ""people"". For instance, I was born in the USA to parents that were born in Latvia. So would you assume that I should stay in america as I'm a citizen and be separated from my family as they should go back to latvia? Your thinking is incredibly black and white, you ignore all nuances. It's also incredibly paranoid and fear mongering, there arent cultures being wiped out due to people simply moving into a country. You're acting as if every immigrant is there to kill and replace the population of a country, instead of bettering their lives. You're blatantly racist, dont say you arent. You're voting for ethno states, clear and simple. For instance, would you say African americans should be sent to Africa, and white people in the US be sent back to europe, because their ancestors went (or were forced to go) to North America? What do you claim a Frenchman is? Is it a white man in france? Or is it anyone who's lived there for a time? If so, how long would someone have to live in france to be counted as french?

You said that people don’t care if Jesus is White, Brown, or Black. However, the scripture stated clearly that Jesus comes from Shem, so He is a Semite, not Caucasian or African. Acknowledging that Jesus is a Semite could shut the mouth of Anti-Semitism who called themselves Christian. All the KKK and Nazis want the world to think that Jesus is white, so that they can hate the Semitic people and eliminate the brown/black skinned race.        It is important for the whole world to know that Jesus is a Middle Eastern Jew, and he is the Son of Jacob, the Son of Issac, and the Son of Abraham, because Salvation is from Israel, and will return to Israel in the end.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@janebille,"I didn't know about sihk, so this was super informative! I've always thought turbans look cool, but now I also understand the meaning behind them a bit more, which is brilliant! Education is key! It is okay not to know, don't shame each other for it, just be open to learn more! 🧡  However, I want to respect all people's differences and religions, but if a air staff personal asks you to take something off, it is important to do so. Maybe be takenninto the screening room, though super uncomfortable, could be a (not perfect!) solution to remove religious items in more private settings... I understand that the issue is, that people won't take them off at all, private room or not, and that some people, especially those darker, gets targeted a lot... but a air plane cabine is such a sensitive area, and we can't risk the safty of others... I will never be able to understand the hardship of having your religious believes targeted, but we have to come to a common understanding. One where religion is respected, but also one where for example airport staff can guaranty the safety on board by asking people to remove clothing, as they do with hats, jackets, boots and more... so I understand both sides, but aware that there's more to the issue and that it's a sensitive, but important topic to educate upon!",5년 전,2,

The double standard is absurd. So the very premise of this video is itself a lie which Westerners should stop accepting.    Furthermore, every nation has the right to deny entry to whomever they choose. That is their sovereign right. If they want cultural preservation, again, that is their right. (And it has absolutely nothing to do with racism, so spare me the slander.)  A right, incidentally, that is entirely in practice by the Muslim nations of the world. Apparently, I need to repeat myself here.   Of course, we should be kind and respectful to all in life, and strive to be on good terms with everyone, but the mindless political correctness needs to end if we are to survive.

Sikhs believes in one God. He is omnipresent, Eternal truth is his name, He is the creator, Without fear, without hate,Immortal without form, Beyond birth and death, Self-existent, Genderless, Eternal.  One should do good karma and help mankind. Serving to mankind is service to God. Universal brotherhood is big part of Sikhism.  All Religions are same in the eyes of God.  God sends massangers to earth in different time periods to awake mankind and stop their suffering. Like Lord Jesus Christ (Christianity), Lord Ram & Lord Krishen (Hinduism), Lord Mohammed (Islam), Lord Buddha (Buddhism), Guru Nank Devji & 10 more (Sikhism).  Some people blame religions for global crises or whatever unrest in the world or personal problems. Problem lies that some evil humans mold the teachings of Lords or prophets according to their needs and name it religious cause and creates unrest in the world. People who fall in their traps are those who doesn't read their holy books fully and not try to understand or uses it everyday life.  Let's start doing good deeds, help the mankind and stop converting people into another religion. RELIGION helps us to connect with the true creator, not starting war on other religion.

Jesus was from the middle east, just like them, and he was dark skinned, just like them. Jesus did not stand out in a crowd, as the bible says. That means he was not different in appearance from the other Israelites. Hence, he was dark skinned, and dark haired. Even some Christians agree on this. And what do you mean 'modern inhabitants'?

Goths, Celts, Germanic are European races! Israelites are Middle Eastern, and much older than them! And Assyrians were descendants of Babylonians and Mesopotamians, who were dark skinned. And original inhabitants of India were the dark skinned Indus Valley Civilization, in modern day Pakistan. The lighter skinned people of Indian subcontinent are descendants of the Aryans (not the ones Hitler had wet dreams about, real Aryans) from Central Asia, who came later on.

The Bible and Testament were altered by humans. And Muhammad was mentioned in the original bible before it was altered. But clearly you don't believe that, so I'm not gonna bother on that any more.  Your logic for why Babylonians and Assyrians were white is pathetic. All humans are the children of Adam, but there are still black and brown people among us. If they are the children of Adam, and not white, then why couldn't the Assyrians have been as well? Also, Anglo-Saxons were never from the middle east, and they never lived there. By origin, they were a Germanic tribe from Northern Germany until they left their homeland and went to Britain. Assyrians weren't white, they were brown just like their Babylonian and Mesopotamian ancestors. The white skinned Aryans were NOT middle eastern and they were NOT Assyrian. They were nomads from the Eurasian and Central Asian steppes. Spitting out the names of random civilizations and peoples does not make you correct, nor intelligent. The 'white race' were all barbarian tribes around the time of earlier prophets such as Noah. The people who have ALWAYS inhabited the Middle East were dark skinned. White people were NEVER the original inhabitants. The dark skinned people are older than the white race. The first humans were black, white skin evolved later on. These are basic facts.

It is often politically charged with extremists wanting political power more than religious power. People don't really like to talk about it because everybody is dead set on their beliefs. So when extremist blows up in people's faces, people just point fingers saying ""it's them Abrahamic religions and their egotistic god!!!"" Or ""those damn idols worshippers and black magicians!!!""

The more educated people are the better our society. ""Are you a Muslim?"" No ""Do people always asks you to educate them about islam?"" Well Islam makes an interesting conversational piece given it recent thrust into the media spot light, but I want to avoid misinformation as Muslims claim coming from MSM(Main Stream Media) and so I ask Muslims for clarification about their religion. Feel free to ask me any questions I will answer them, as I did above. My only request is that you answer my questions in the spirit of reciprocity, how else do we begin to understand each other if not through dialogue?",5년 전,0,
@khushboo5186," @veganath You don't have to understand my religion to understand me. Not everyone who follows the same faith as me might not be a good person as well. Some people of you're own faith scares me because of their islamophobia and violent behavior. But I would never see another hindu person as the same, because I don't care about what religion you practice, If you're a good person then you're good and if you're bad then you're bad. And lastly, if you're really interested in knowing more about Islamic values you should go to someone who has a vast knowledge of Islam, a maulana perhaps.",5년 전,0,
@veganath," @khushboo5186  ""You don't have to understand my religion to understand me"" actually it is Islam that I want to understand, Islam is an ideology that is a framework that informs adherents behaviour, so my goal isn't to critique individuals, but it is to get insight into how what 'adherents' believe informs their behaviour. For example knowing whether under Islamic sharia there are circumstance where people who commit an inherently non-violent act can be judged to be sentenced to death, which is the question about Islam that I was attempting to get an answer from you as an 'adherent' of Islam. ""Some people of you're own faith"" I'm not convinced of any theist claims as they relate to anything supernatural, I guess people would label me  non-religious or atheist. So I do not have a doctrine/scripture that informs my behaviour. ""I don't care about what religion you practice"" actually we should care about religions people practice. We at least should have love & compassion for other people acknowledging they have the same potential to suffer as we could & that whatever we give returns to us in kind. However, I hope you agree that we ALL should be unapologetic about leveling criticism at any ideology, religious and or political that advocates & is the impetus for adherents to cause others(human & non-human) to suffer unnecessarily? Do you agree? As an example, Amazonian Headhunters adorn themselves with the shrunken human heads of people that they have killed, it is part of their 'religious' conviction, tell me do you respect their religious convictions or do you condemn these people's ideology that is the impetus to cause others(human & non-human) to suffer unnecessarily? I don't know about you but I would not want Amazonian headhunter in my community, given what religious convictions they hold, and it would NOT be 'Amazonaphobia' simply because it wouldn't be IRRATIONAL to fear them given their religious conviction. (PHOBIA = irrational fear) ""I would never see another hindu person as the same"" however, if there religious ideology advocated for them to cause others(human & non-human) to suffer unnecessarily then you should be unrelenting in your criticism of Hinduism(not the people) ""...if you're bad then you're bad"" actually it is environment(both internal & external) that determines behaviour, we cannot escape this reality. People are neither inherently good or bad. Here is a story in my life that illustrates the idea of environment and behavior. I was walking my dog, a Rottweiler(very big dog...lol), in the park with my children patting it and a woman approached me and told me ""You have a good dog"", I replied no Ma'am the dog is trained to be good, I could just as easily trained it to be ""bad"" i.e. extremely aggressive. Whether one is deemed good or bad is ultimately determined by the environment that one is exposed to in life. Harsh resource scarce environment unfortunately force people to resort to violence to survive, today it doesn't have to be like that, but if we are to avoid mutually assured destruction then we are going to have to be willing to as theists say use our god given intelligence to find consensus on a shared mutually beneficial vision for nurturing a ""one tribe of humanity"" the end goal has to be as I hear Muslims say to ensure we all pass this test of life with the best of deeds borne of love a consequence of solutions that create abundance. Today this is possible but not while we are dogmatically inflexible and myopically tribal...",5년 전,0,

Sikhism is influenced by Hinduism but its more than that. Sikhism grew in a Hindu universe basically and Hinduism is its core without some non indic influence, like Islam. Islam definitely influenced some aspects but only peripherally. Buddhism influenced Sikhism but Buddhism is itself an offshot of Hinduism and basically Hinduism with reformist tendencies, a More streamlined and specific Hindu school. Sikhism is also very heavily influenced by Bhakti traditions within Hinduism which seeks to take the highly abstract and philosophical religion to the masses. The most significant departure of Sikhism from mainstream contranmpaneous Hinduism was its heavy absorption of Bhakti traditions.",5년 전,0,

@cajonjackie2075,"First, who ever coined those asinine phrases ""This-phobe, That-phobe and TheOther-phobe is a blithering moron with no English language skills what-so-ever. One might, had they the desire, express their solidarity with these politically correct imbeciles, call these particular illiterates ""Englishlanguagephobic"" because the only way to develop such unrefined language skills is to be ""actually"" afraid to speak and express yourself in the vein of an adult without mental infirmities. Second, this ""Sikh"" issue would be equally endemic in most places on earth where the population is ignorant of the Sikh's religion and way of life. SAY, do you guys still tell your book goodnight, every night, then wake it first thing in the morning at the Golden Temple? I must say that I've found it ""A very tolerant position to hold"" for the Sikh to allow their Holy book to stay on such ""shaky(?)"" ground. To be honest I'm surprised it hasn't been destroyed yet by the population surrounding the site. One more thing about Phobic's. They are actually afraid of the focus of their phobia. Morons use the word to describe "" an intolerance"" of other folks habits and lifestyle choices. I, for one, should be, I suppose, described by these inbred dolts as being a ""Faith-O-phobic""? But, on the other hand, living up to my own standard of intolerance towards the invention of words (used to mask illiteracy only, when their are words aplenty to describe exactly what it is you're trying to express) I must dissuade anyone else from using my term for myself and forswear the use of it myself. BTW the term was to mean ""I am an atheist and believe those who are not to be """"not much further along the evolutionary path than the other members of the Great Ape family."""" Man, living in total ignorance of the natural forces that surround him, invented God's to answer all the questions he asked but never received an answer to. Yet, as an atheist, I have ZERO fear of other's religions, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE, the only one I'm aware of that expressly commands, IN IT'S MOST HOLY BOOK, it's adherence's to ""Ambush"" to ""KILL"" to ""Enslave"" etc ad nausea the infidel. I'll leave you to guess which, so called, faith these tenets belong to AND ARE WRITTEN DOWN WITHIN THE PAGES  OF IT'S HOLY BOOK.  One Clue:...... it is NOT the Sikh's, Buddhist, Shinto, Jew, Christian (Western or Eastern) nor does it belong to any other religion, that I'm aware of, and a religion that still exists today. I think if you don't take the word other folks religions, at face value then you're stupid and if you fear them ""At their word"" then it's perhaps the right time to be PHOBIC.  Be a bit phobic and, just perhaps, stay alive. Fear not and enter where angles fear to tread then, just perhaps, it'll be your head sawn off, LIVE, in living color, on CNN?",5년 전,2,

My brother works in media in Singapore and knows the ins and outs of restrictions placed on the press.

@arjun9339,"@david cunningham I was responding to your similar comment above reg Americans.  Why I brought it up here was to point out that perhaps this ignorance has been driven to such high levels owing to the immense hatred, violence and terror spread by Islamists (a few, not all).

@davidcunningham9282," @arjun9339  that's a fair point but you could then argue that because of the hatred and violence spread by some christians, we should identify any white man or woman as an evangelist because this is essentially what's happening here. any brown man with a beard and a turban is muslim.  i do understand why this is common in America. when you have successive governments decade after decade spreading propaganda, restricting education, and teaching backwards ideologies like intelligent design, this level of ignorance towards outside cultures is to be expected.   i'm not sure what the answer is outside of removing corporate money from government and complete reform of the education system.",5년 전,0,
@arjun9339,"@david cunningham Everything, including the solution in the last line, that you’ve said is so general and universally true that I can’t argue with any of it but it’s still not pertinent to the matter being discussed, I feel.  This mistaken harassment of Sikhs was not happening prior to the last two decades...so maybe there is a cause & effect that needs to be identified.  Government cannot push a rope. It merely encashes on an undercurrent that’s already flowing within the public. The apprehension is real and needs to be addressed by respective governments worldwide - perhaps by a combination of education and alternate actions.",5년 전,0,
@davidcunningham9282," @arjun9339  it makes sense that this harassment has been occurring in the last two decades. american interference in the middle east, not least its military and financial aid to israel, and routine arming of  opposing sides depending on vested interests has led to a higher level of terrorism and consequently the message being pushed that there is a constant threat  from ""insert middle eastern country here"" has led to a suspicious view being taken with regard to ""brown man with beard and turban"". i live in ireland where we have pretty much every nationality and colour and cases of racism are extremely rare here",5년 전,0,

The Daily Show, for the sake of preventing controversy, used a neutral map. It was the right thing to do. Showing the Indian version, or the Pakistani version, would have been bad for them. And what am I to gain by looking up 70 year old maps? Why don't you look up modern day maps of the world? Maps made outside of India and Pakistan, that is.

@ahmedfawad16," @psychologienerd7546  I, unlike you, did study the Quran and Islamic history. Muslims are not based on war.

And he who saves a life, has done a great deed equivalent to saving all of mankind. The Quran does allow violence, yes, but only in self defense. Allah hates the man who starts a war.  Muhammad did not murder anyone. The only people he killed were only a handful of enemies during battles, and those battles were all retaliatory. The Kaaba was built by Abraham to worship Allah. Only later did it become a site of pagan worship. Then, in 629, Muhammad conquered Makkah, and the Kaaba was once again used for its intended purpose. He specifically gave his troops the order to NOT kill anyone. No doors broken down, no swords drawn, no blood spilt that day.   After the conquest, 10 people were sentenced to death, and they had all been sentenced because of murder or other crimes. And even then, only 6 or 7 were actually killed. The rest were set free, and one even became a commander in the Rashidun army.  Not really related but you said 3-4 gods in the Kaaba. That's also wrong cuz there were over 360 different gods in there prior to Islam. And the Kaaba was called the Kaaba by the pagan Meccans as well, so the ""now Kaaba"" thing is also inccorect.",5년 전(수정됨),2,

The Christians who ""disappeared"" in the east mostly converted. Some were killed, and some fled. But it is beyond stupid to say that all disbelievers were killed. You do know that there were some Jewish and Christian scholars working alongside Muslims during the Islamic Golden Age? Religiously, the first thought of a Muslim towards a non Muslim should be to try and convert, but not force. Some Hindus were killed by Muslims, but just as many muslims were killed at the hands of Hindus, and are still being killed to this day. And do I need to mention the Crusades, that killed over 2 million people? Muslims have been victims of religiously motivated atrocities just as much as any other religion.  Violence is only allowed in Islam in self defense. To put it simply, you can not use physical violence, unless someone else is using physical violence against you. If you say ""** Allah"", it does NOT justify any muslims trying to attack you. That is wrong, and un-Islamic. Obviously, self defense can be necessary in conditions other than violence, but those conditions have their own rules, and since our discussion is about only violence, I won't go into them.  Cold blooded murder, and killing someone in battle who is also trying to kill you, are two different things. Muhammad and his followers were tortured, abused and even killed for years in Makkah. Even after they left for Madina, the meccans still chased after them, and destroyed their property back in Makkah. Muhammad himself also suffered a lot, and even escaped assassination multiple times. He took action against the people who had committed every crime imaginable against his him and his followers, but that counts as a cold blooded crime now.  Is there any proof saying that Abraham did not build the Kaaba? It is not Islamic propaganda just because you said so. Also, if there were 3 or 4 main idols, it does not change the fact that the Meccans and pagan Arabs still worshipped 360 gods in the Kaaba. Muhammad did not force anyone to believe what he said, most of Mecca converted of their own will, including Abu Sufiyan, the mightiest Meccan leader.  Most Jews nowadays don't recognize Muhammad as a prophet, but back in the seventh century, the first people who recognized Muhammad as the last prophet, as foretold in the bible and testament, were a Jewish tribe.

@ahmedfawad16," @psychologienerd7546  instead of wasting my time arguing with you on those other topics you mentioned (whether or not Islam is authentic etc) I'm gonna say why Islam is a religion of peace, cuz that's the main thing we were discussing.   You said that some religions are based on war. Wrong. There are no major world religions based on violence. Humans aren't exactly peaceful creatures, but open negativity and violence never attracts anyone. The few who are attracted by it are psychopaths. A religion as massive as Islam can never be based on violence. Use your brain, if a quarter of humanity truly was evil, then would the world really exist? You claimed to have 'ripped away my argument with facts' but your entire argument was basically 'Jews don't like Islam so islam bad'. Jews also rejected Christianity. They nailed him to a cross, remember? They only 'accepted' it when they both started hating islam.   The only reason Muhammad marched into Makkah with an army was because they wanted to prevent violence. Armies can also be used peacefully. The main reason the army was there so that the Meccans would avoid risking violence. The conquest of Makkah happened in retaliation, you should also know that. The pagan tribes had broken the Huddaibya treaty and slaughtered some muslims during the night. On the side note: Islam did not spread just because they attacked the stronger Byzantium and Persia. All of Arabia had already converted to Islam, so that was a considerable following to begin with.  Also, I know that I'm not the best debater, so look up Mehdi Hassan's bit in the Oxford Union Islamic peace debate. He completely destroys any argument that islam is violent. And if you want to know what Islam is really like, then watch Dr. Zakir Naik's videos. He's basically as true of a Muslim as you can get.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

[18] » It was also considered by Italian Renaissance scholar Gerolamo Cardano as one of the twelve greatest minds of the Middle Ages. He moved around the country and in Syria. He went to Aleppo and lived in the court of Saif al-Dawla al-Hamdani for a while. Then he went to Damascus and lived there until his death at the age of 80 years and was buried in Damascus.  Al-Farabi was named the ""second teacher"" in relation to the first teacher Aristotle and the launch because of his interest in logic because Al-Farabi is the explanation of Aristotle's logical works  He was a mathematician and physicist and also had interests in pharmacy, encyclopedic writing, astronomy, and history. He studied mathematics at the hands of the scientist Mansur bin Iraq (970-1036), Asir Ibn Sina (980-1037) and Ibn Maskoui (932-1030) philosophers from the city of Al-Rai located in Tehran Province. He learned Greek and Sanskrit during his travels and wrote in Arabic and Persian. Al-Biruni in the language of Khwarizm means strange or coming from outside the town, Al-Biruni wrote many books on scientific, historical and astronomical issues and has contributions in calculating triangles, circle, longitude and latitude, the rotation of the earth and the difference between the speed of light and the speed of sound, in addition to what he wrote in the history of India [24] ]. He was also famous for his books on pharmacy and medicines, where he wrote late in his life a book called ""Pharmacy in Medicine"" and the book was on the essence of drugs and their names A prominent picture of the culture of the Abbasid era, which includes many parties, as it contained natural knowledge and jurisprudential issues, and he spoke in the politics of nations, as he spoke about other religious sects and spoke about many geographical issues and the characteristics of many countries and the impact of the environment on animals, people and trees. He spoke on medicine as well as diseases in animals and in humans He mentioned many medical, plant, animal, and mineral vocabulary, as he mentioned selected verses from rare Arabic poetry in addition to other proverbs and funny anecdotes. The Arabs had known navigational and astronomical machines to determine latitude, relying on this for their accurate knowledge of the locations of the stars. Among these machines were ""perfection"" and ""ballistic"" and ""plate"" and the last one that stunned ""Vasco da Gama"" when he saw it with Ahmed bin Majid ""a rose Wind »It is a machine of wood that divides the horizon circle into the original four sides.

Later geographers mention that they saw the news of time with more than thirty parts, but it was lost and only one part of it was found and perhaps This part is attributed to Al-Masoudi because his method differs from that of Al-Masoudi (Book of Wonders and Strange Things), or that Al-Masoudi distributed the material of this book in the folds of his other books.

His four books are: His huge bibliographical dictionary, which he developed in the Arabic language and which surrounds all branches of science and literature, then his basic travel in general geography in the Turkish language, and finally two works in the Turkish language that have a more specialized nature, one of which is a modified form of a European atlas of the near era and the other is a historical workbook Closely related to navigation geography Al-Biruni is considered one of the greatest scholars known in the medieval Islamic era, his knowledge included physics, mathematics and natural sciences, and he had a prominent position as a historian, linguist and chronology scientist. [8] Al Biruni studied almost all fields of science, and his research and hard work were rewarded. [9] His royal court and powerful members of society sought him to urge him to conduct scientific research, study, and uncover some matters. Al-Biruni lived during the golden age of Islam, where scientific research took place alongside the methodology and thinking of Islamic religion. In addition to this type of influence, al-Biruni was also influenced by other nations, such as the Greeks, from whom he was inspired by his studies of philosophy.

Al-Biruni spent most of his time in Ghazni, which became the capital of Ghaznoyan, and is currently located in the eastern center of Afghanistan. Al-Biruni traveled to South Asia and wrote a study on Indian culture, ""Achieving the Acceptable or Sentiment of India by India"" after exploring Hinduism practiced in India. Al-Biruni is nicknamed ""the founder of the Indian or the Indian flag."" He was also known for his objective writings on the customs and beliefs of many nations.

Al-Khwarizmi organized and corrected Ptolemy's data on Africa and the Middle East.

Stop trying to dehumanise Palestinians, they are your own brethren. Being Muslim doesn't change ethnicity, as Islam is a religion. Palestinians are Muslims, Christians, Jewish and Atheists.

@li.gren.," @ranbirvaid449  - Palestine was first mentioned in writing in 1150 BC during the Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt. That is circa 3200 years ago. The land and its people is mentioned in Roman scripts as well as the Torah. The Hebrews were not the first inhabitants of what is now Israel, and in our modern era campaigning for an ethnically cleansed nation is an atrocity. By ethnic cleansing I mean driving people from their ancestral homes and lands, occupation, displacement, extrajudicial murders, terrorism. You may feel you have the right to perpetrate ethnic cleansing of an area, because you think you have some special right to drive out and kill people for not being of your religion or ethnic group. But that is just the exact same thinking and action of Nazis and the KKK and every other racist extremist supremacist ideology that think they have some divine right to steal and murder what they consider ""sub-humans"". You are defending the oppression and killing of civilians in our modern time, for what was perpetrated in the past by others. It is illogical and immoral. By that ""logic"", there would be few people who wouldn't have the 'right' to steal and murder people who share some biological trait or ancestry with historical perpetrators.

Wars that Israel won with the help of Evangelical Christian Americans who have sick fantasies of Armageddon and are waiting for the end times and for the Jewish people to die.

@irisblack3135,"​ @li.gren.  Well, I’ll tell you this much; not Bernie Sanders (who’s not even a candidate anymore), not Elizabeth Warren, not Joe Biden, and not Hillary Clinton.   Why? Well, for starters, Elizabeth is a liar who pretended she was Native American. And not to be mean but Joe Biden can barely form a sentence, and when he does it’s either very racist or just plain nonsense. He’s also a creep that smells women’s hair and was accused of sexual assault, just as Trump was. Which, let’s face it, both could be true for all we know. And let’s not forget Hillary and the email controversy.   And to top it all off, none of them are pro-life.  Which, I am very passionate about.   So how do you expect a Republican like me to vote for anyone else besides Trump? They all have their faults, I’m sure you can agree. You, as a Democrat, also can agree that even if you don’t fully agree with them, it’s better to vote than not to. Right? So, I don’t see why me voting for a person I personally saw as the best candidate, means anything other than that.   Donald Trump was pro-life, wanted to fix America’s immigration issue, a successful businessman, was very supportive of the LGBTQ+ community, etc. I disagree with a lot of things he’s done and said, but at the end of the day, he’s (in my opinion) better than the other candidates.   Anyways, just wanted to get all that out of the way so I can just say this; I don’t hate anybody because of who they vote for, I don’t think they’re ignorant because of who they vote for, and I sure don’t harass people for wearing a Bernie shirt, or whatever. So, please, learn to respect others’ opinions if they respect yours. And I’ll tell you this, I do respect your opinion and I hope you can do the same with mine. Have a great day. 👍🏽  P. S. What exactly do you mean by “in the streets protecting the first amendment from this tyrant threat to the constitution and our freedom”? And, no, I don’t really see Trump as a fascist or a tyrant, at the moment. But he could change.   P. S. S. I’m not a COMPLETE Trump supporter. I just would rather him as president than the other candidates.",5년 전,1,
@li.gren.," @irisblack3135  - Elizabeth Warren claimed that a great great grandmother was Native American, which her DNAtest showed was likely true. Have you read Hillary's emails? There's nothing there. Several Republican-led investigations have come up with no proof of criminal activity that they can charge her for.  Trump is a fascist who is actively trying to suppress the first amendment by spreading misinformation and propaganda against the peaceful protests in all 50 states, and ordering police brutality against the protesters. Police are even shooting at people on their own porches right now, for simply being on their porches. The only way you can choose to not acknowledge that Trump and his establishment has turned USA into a fascist state is if you believe you are safe because you are on the ""right"" side.

I never said anything about the prophet Moses as he is also the messager of Allah as the Holy Prophet Muhammad Saw. So its basically going against my own Prophet I not an idiot to do that.  our land was destroyed by Babylonian Nebucadnazar or and the Roman Emperor Titan or titas most important God has promised to rebuild the promised land to you guys for two time which the 1 time has happened the second time it is waiting but only for the last time as the messaih for the Jews to come and the The Prophet Isa ( Jesus ) to come so.

So basically I had to learn English (I already was quite familiar with it but now I’m basically fluent), I had to study U. S history, I had to answer a lot of questions, and a whole lot of other things. In case you were wondering, I’m Latina-Hispanic. If I understand correctly you think I shouldn’t have stated I was a Mexican if I’m no longer Mexican and am able to vote for the U. S president? If so, you’re right. I’m just American now.   And why do you need to know what part of Mexico I’m from?",5년 전,0,

@milindaa1993,"Hasan Minhaj is an award winning TV producer and comedian. so the first thing you have to keep in mind is that the tone of this interview is definite satire. It takes on very sensitive, frustrating and difficult subjects with lightheartedness and humour. sometimes it may come across as if he is being a downright asshole but its to highlight current issues prevalent in society today. He becomes that way in order to explain to us the stereotypical majority who are hypocritical and ignorant. Being a muslim in the States im sure he has had his fair share of racism, so i highly doubt he himself is one of them. When he tells Waris to 'disguise himself' Hasan is being sarcastic and does it in such a way to get that particular response of out him. In this day and age, comedy networks and independent media are actually fair and balanced opinion platforms on politics and social issues. much more than mainstream media. so always keep an open mind because these shows expose issues as they really are. plus i think everything and anything can be criticized and poked fun at as long as it doesnt kill people. we must be open minded enough to tolerate speech that may be offensive to us and our beliefs. That is in effect, free speech, which ultimately leads to greater understanding. Anyways may i suggest The Opposition with Jordan Klepper, Jim Jeffries, Desi Lydic and The Young Turks.

The word race is a social construct according to biological and biomedical scientists, there is only one single race, the homo sapiens,  we differ only by ancestry and even then you may have middle eastern or african genes. The difference in skin color or hair texture is because of difference in alleles and even those alleles are not exclusive to one specific region. A 2002 Stanford study found that Only 1℅ of people of any geographical region have specific alleles that comprises of 7.4℅ of all alleles. So 99℅ of the people present in your ""greater race"" share alleles with people with other geographical regions. Also studies have found we are 99.9℅ similar genealogically. Not only are you an ignorant racist, you lack basic education and knowledge. There are no studies which point to any race or people of geographical region being superior, I believe in peer reviewed journal entries, so show me. sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/science-genetics-reshaping-race-debate-21st-century/",5년 전,19,

Then what is the recompense for those who do that among you except disgrace in worldly life; and on the Day of Resurrection they will be sent back to the severest of punishment. And Allah is not unaware of what you do."" (2:85)  ""Many of the People of the Scripture wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed, out of envy from themselves [even] after the truth has become clear to them. So pardon and overlook until Allah delivers His command. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent."" (2:109)  ""The example of those who disbelieve is like that of one who shouts at what hears nothing but calls and cries cattle or sheep - deaf, dumb and blind, so they do not understand."" (2:171)  ""O People of the Scripture, why do you confuse the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know [it]?"" (3:71)  ""...But whoever disbelieves - then indeed, Allah is free from need of the worlds."" (3:97)  ""They wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike..."" (4:89)  ""...This day those who disbelieve have despaired of [defeating] your religion; so fear them not, but fear Me..."" (5:3)  ""...They distort words beyond their [proper] usages, saying ""If you are given this, take it; but if you are not given it, then beware.""

(5:41)  ""...But those who disbelieve invent falsehood about Allah, and most of them do not reason"" (5:103)  ""They want to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah refuses except to perfect His light, although the disbelievers dislike it."" (9:32)  ""Indeed, those who disbelieve spend their wealth to avert [people] from the way of Allah . So they will spend it; then it will be for them a [source of] regret; then they will be overcome..."" (8:36)  ""So the eminent among those who disbelieved from his people said, "" We do not see you but as a man like ourselves, and we do not see you followed except by those who are the lowest of us [and] at first suggestion. And we do not see in you over us any merit; rather, we think you are liars."" He said, ""O my people have you considered: if I should be upon clear evidence from my Lord while He has given me mercy from Himself but it has been made unapparent to you, should we force it upon you while you are averse to it?""

""That is their recompense - Hell - for what they denied and [because] they took My signs and My messengers in ridicule."" (18:106-103)  ""Do you not see that We have sent the devils upon the disbelievers, inciting them to [evil] with [constant] incitement?""

At that time Mughal started ruling some of India and some of the Mughals were cruel enough to force people into Islam... so 10 th Guru ( Guru Gobind Singh ji) started recruiting common people and made them warriors  and he made Khalsa ( almost means “the true person” - my vocabulary isn’t that rich to explain this word.) ... today’s sikhs wear the attire of Khalsa and THIS ATTIRE WAS MADE TO HIGHLIGHT SIKHS FROM THE CROWD SO THAT ANYONE COULD ASK FOR HELP from sikhs , also this was a practical attire of that time because if worn properly - turban avoids head injury also every piece of the attire carries meaning behind it and this attire is completely different from a Muslim attire also google “ traditional Muslim attire” and you might find answers.",5년 전(수정됨),3,

I remember wondering why there were men wearing turbans, and I was amazed to learn about why they’re worn and the other parts of their religion and how similar it is to mine. The turban hit home because there are members of my church (including myself) that wear clothing to remind us of God and our commitment to be good people. Same thing happens sometimes when people confuse us with Jehovah’s Witnesses or FLDS people. “Hey, why do you guys do such and such?”  “Ma’am, I don’t know.

Still not racist but I think airport security is not racist, only that they use common sense, would someone betray their own country or act in hatred towards one that have seemingly oppressed them. For example, my heritage is in Myanmar, I am sure that they treated everyone equally in their pat oppressiveness, because it was an equal likelihood that the people that lived there would work to abolish their government, FYI socialism sucks for you curious kids, a little summary is that Burma (Myanmar) used to have the greatest southern Asian economy (may be specified) because it had vast supply of the richest wood on earth, when a new leader said I like this socialism thing where everybody has to pay for the random people that may not make the best decisions. This caused everyone to be lost in the rubble of a falling economy, then they started shooting people because governments are sometimes bad but that's another story.

@mvs3553," William Shakespeare  Any religion or ideology is open to being questioned or critiqued.

Humans are hypocrites and ideologies  just divide us people need to be educated and look at religions critically, take a world religions course or read a book about it.  What religions have in common is when you look at their mystics or when you read about their leaders describe their ""awakening"" expereinces..

He went to Aleppo and lived in the court of Saif al-Dawla al-Hamdani for a while. Then he went to Damascus and lived there until his death at the age of 80 years and was buried in Damascus.  Al-Farabi was named the ""second teacher"" in relation to the first teacher Aristotle and the launch because of his interest in logic because Al-Farabi is the explanation of Aristotle's logical works  He was a mathematician and physicist and also had interests in pharmacy, encyclopedic writing, astronomy, and history. He studied mathematics at the hands of the scientist Mansur bin Iraq (970-1036), Asir Ibn Sina (980-1037) and Ibn Maskoui (932-1030) philosophers from the city of Al-Rai located in Tehran Province. He learned Greek and Sanskrit during his travels and wrote in Arabic and Persian. Al-Biruni in the language of Khwarizm means strange or coming from outside the town, Al-Biruni wrote many books on scientific, historical and astronomical issues and has contributions in calculating triangles, circle, longitude and latitude, the rotation of the earth and the difference between the speed of light and the speed of sound, in addition to what he wrote in the history of India [24] ]. He was also famous for his books on pharmacy and medicines, where he wrote late in his life a book called ""Pharmacy in Medicine"" and the book was on the essence of drugs and their names A prominent picture of the culture of the Abbasid era, which includes many parties, as it contained natural knowledge and jurisprudential issues, and he spoke in the politics of nations, as he spoke about other religious sects and spoke about many geographical issues and the characteristics of many countries and the impact of the environment on animals, people and trees. He spoke on medicine as well as diseases in animals and in humans He mentioned many medical, plant, animal, and mineral vocabulary, as he mentioned selected verses from rare Arabic poetry in addition to other proverbs and funny anecdotes. The Arabs had known navigational and astronomical machines to determine latitude, relying on this for their accurate knowledge of the locations of the stars. Among these machines were ""perfection"" and ""ballistic"" and ""plate"" and the last one that stunned ""Vasco da Gama"" when he saw it with Ahmed bin Majid ""a rose Wind »It is a machine of wood that divides the horizon circle into the original four sides.

Later geographers mention that they saw the news of time with more than thirty parts, but it was lost and only one part of it was found and perhaps This part is attributed to Al-Masoudi because his method differs from that of Al-Masoudi (Book of Wonders and Strange Things), or that Al-Masoudi distributed the material of this book in the folds of his other books.

His four books are: His huge bibliographical dictionary, which he developed in the Arabic language and which surrounds all branches of science and literature, then his basic travel in general geography in the Turkish language, and finally two works in the Turkish language that have a more specialized nature, one of which is a modified form of a European atlas of the near era and the other is a historical workbook Closely related to navigation geography Al-Biruni is considered one of the greatest scholars known in the medieval Islamic era, his knowledge included physics, mathematics and natural sciences, and he had a prominent position as a historian, linguist and chronology scientist. [8] Al Biruni studied almost all fields of science, and his research and hard work were rewarded. [9] His royal court and powerful members of society sought him to urge him to conduct scientific research, study, and uncover some matters. Al-Biruni lived during the golden age of Islam, where scientific research took place alongside the methodology and thinking of Islamic religion. In addition to this type of influence, al-Biruni was also influenced by other nations, such as the Greeks, from whom he was inspired by his studies of philosophy.

The media and history books consistently leave out the murder of Vincent Chin, one of the most hate crime cases ever, but during the campaign for justice, Revered Jesse Jackson took time out of his presidential campaign to join and speak out against the racism. Despite that there is racism and conflict between these groups, the media and history books have consistently downplayed when we've come together. Let's work towards building that unity further.

@mzheng776," @FlowerTower  Hi, I know that you may not want to be associated with this comment thread anymore but I just wanted to say that I truly found your comments very enlightening, but also very conflicting at the same time. I agree with your opinions on anti-black sentiment in Asian communities, especially the Chinese communities, and as an Asian American of Chinese background- I’m sorry that you have to go through this. In fact, I’m sorry to all black people who have undergone this racism. My family owns a business and I have personally seen the marginalization of black people that occur, even within the minority community.   However, I just wanted to state some points that I find a bit confusing and some nuances in your arguments.  Firstly, Black treatment in China and America. I know that as a Chinese person myself, I do not represent my whole community, but I still apologize on part of them for what happened. This discrimination is absolutely not beneficial to bettering Chinese communities but has been constantly reinforced as a result of Chinese collectivist and traditionalist culture as well as by the Chinese Communist Government. The Chinese Communist government on part has caused a lot of grief for all ethnicities. From exploiting Muslims in re-education camps to the recent uncovering of the generational Xenophobia in China, they have caused much pain for minority groups, but also for their own people as well. I don't identify with the Chinese Communist Government, but whatever they do will label my future interactions in American society as because I am ""Chinese"", I am typically identified as a ""Chinese citizen"", as a result, I now hold responsibility, but that is not true. I support none of these actions. I am an American. My ethnicity is Chinese, but I am American. Nevertheless, when people say that the Chinese Communist government covered up Covid-19 since I am Chinese, I will be held responsible. Such as how ""radical Islam"" and ""terrorism"" characterizes members of the Middle-Eastern community due to their ethnicity and skin-color, even if they still may be American citizens.     Anti-black sentiment in America, by Asian-Americans, is not justified. All minorities go through racism, I know that you have mentioned that "" y’all only mention this reverse black on asian racism when someone brings up anti-blackness Asians exhibit."", but I want to mention as to why. ""Model minority"", if you haven't heard of this before, please take some time to search it up. It is what most Asian Americans are defined as, the complacent, law-abiding minority community who does not stir up what American classifies as ""trouble"". It has bought us many benefits, but as a result, it has silenced us. We may receive better treatment, but that doesn't mean we don't undergo racism. Xenophobia and nativist culture have targeted many Asian American members of the community, but it's never spoken up about due to the reinforcements of ""model minority"". To this day, I wish Asian Americans would speak up more on the racism that occurs in society, especially ""yellow-fever"", but that is beside the point. Anti-blackness has always existed within Chinese communities, it's not alright, but that's not to say that both parties aren't at fault. You constantly mention how there is no ""us"", but there is no ""them"" either. We are bonded together under our biology as humans, but the difference in skin tone creates racism. I think that all people are racist to a certain degree, as a result of societal influences. That, in turn, causes a cycle of generalization, discrimination, and racism. I don't hold what you've said to what all black people will think, because your opinion and experiences differ from all black people, however, saying things such as "" I bet they’ll start thinking about their racism when they going out of business. That’s the only time black people matter to them - when we bringing them money."" and ""What’s the added value of Asians besides Chinese food restaurants where they serve stray cats and rats they found outside?"", devalues our experiences and opinions. I know that it's pinpointing, but these comments don't benefit anyone. It's like saying ""The only time Black people care about racism is when it's happening to them."" or ""Black people belong in the jail"". I don't believe these comments, nor do I believe they are true, but it doesn't help benefit the racism in America, does it? There may no be no ""us"", but that doesn't excuse targeting and devaluing of people's opinions and experiences.   Before Covid-19, I experienced racism, after Covid-19, I will experience more prevalent racism. It will be the marginalization of everyone who generalizes Asian-Americans to hold accountability for the Chinese Communist Government, but also those who find excuses to use their own stereotypes and stigmas to categorize and discriminate against us.",5년 전,7,
@FlowerTower," @mzheng776  I think it's strange how you saw an Asian person say to me, ""we have a good reason for being anti-black - black people are thieves and don't have fathers."" and you had no issue with it but when I said something racist back - you were concerned.   It's odd how I had an entire conversation with multiple people with nothing racist being said but when one of you said some racist and ignorant shit about black people FIRST and I rightfully replied with some racist shit, you didn't ask why they started saying dumb shit or anything - you were only worried about what I said.   Let's be real... you don't give a fuck about black people.   Also, nobody ever said Asians don't experience racism... I'm not sure what you're arguing against. I said anti-Asian sentiments aren't a part of black communities like anti black sentiments are a part of Asian ones.

Thank you for teaching me more about something I did not know about. I hope that others will take these comments into consideration and learn from history as well, even if it is too optimistic.

And it's too late for my future children too - I'll tell them to stay far away from y'all as well.

The only thing you can do is choose not to be a racist idiot and teach your future children to not be racist idiots as well.

Are we talking about the Native Americans or the Indians from India ? :P I don't mind being called Indians anyways as it gives us a ""deserverdly"" special status ;) Sorry for deviating from here on. After all, when Columbus came to U.S., he was looking for India to come for trade. India was one of the richest countries in the world and one of the then ""developed super-powers"". While the British and most of Europe were living well barbarically, we were building the first ""modern"" cities with sanitation and other facilities(for e.g. Indus valley).  I was disturbed reading this United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind. Also, by some random street urchin few months back commenting (yes ""racially"") on Indians and their right to work in U.S.  The less disturbing part (related to the case): Ethnically, we are for most part Aryans but there is a huge doubt about Caucasian part of it (which in itself is one of the most confusing things). I mean if people from Iran and Egypt can be Caucasians (and even sometimes Afghans), why not Indians.  The more disturbing part: Hell...these Europeans were looking to trade with India. They spent hell lot of money trying to come to India. So, at least we were at least equal if not superior to Europeans (white/Caucasian). How can they naturalize someone coming from Eastern Europe (many came from Slovak countries not knowing English) but not Indians (most Indians coming to U.S. knew quite a lot of English). But, anyway it shows how people even greatest of governments can be so foolish and dumb and ""racist"" at times. After all, if any one has a right to immigrate to U.S., the first should be Indians (and not Europeans or people from any other country). If any one has a right to stay in this country, they should be second (well, definitely the ""red Indians"" now called Native Americans have to be first in this regard).  10.1K views  View Upvoters  14  0  1  1 comment from Prabuddha Ghosh  ￼  Monika Kothari, abecedarian  Answered June 19, 2012  Originally Answered: When people say 'Asian', does it include Indians?  This depends on the context. The term ""Asian"" has social, political, historical geographical, and even cultural meanings, and its definition varies across space and time.  India is clearly part of Asia, and in a technical sense, it would be incorrect to exclude Indians and other South Asians from the ""Asian"" definition. If we lived in a simpler society, we might agree that all people from Asia are ""Asian"". But politics and history complicate that definition.  Consider, for example...  In the American vernacular, ""Asian"" usually refers to someone of East or Southeast Asian descent.  In the British vernacular, ""Asian"" usually refers to someone of South Asian descent.  The U.S. government categorizes peoples of East Asian, Southeast Asian, and South Asian descent as ""Asian"".  The U.S. government categorizes peoples of Central Asian or West Asian (Middle Eastern) descent as ""white"".  Historically, Indian Americans have been classified as white, ""Hindoo"", ""Other"", and currently, Asian American. in the United States, South Asians have been historically separate from the wider Asian American umbrella. I also think that this beginning to change, and that there is a stronger pan-Asian social/political movement building. All the same, I find myself pleasantly surprised when anyone--ordinary people, academics, politicians, etc.--are inclusive of South Asians when addressing the Asian population as a whole.",5년 전,0,

@zoybean," @Chrislav7  There are tons of Bible versions, and the Bible itself says that it is corrupt. It is Paul's Bible after all. If we are talking context, then you will know that the divinity of Jesus was actually voted on at the Council of Nicea. The Trinity itself does not make any logical sense.

@Chrislav7," @zoybean  Where does the Bible say its corrupt again? You said it was corrupt. That's not the same thing.   What is that supposed to be context for? I'm pointing out the theme of the chapter is about false teachings and people tweaking the word of God to fit their narrative, which is a pretty common theme in the old testament. Not to mention Jesus's biggest bone to pick was with the late church and not with sinners.   Perhaps you're not aware that scribes were not just copyists. They were the teachers of the law and Bible.   You're getting hung up and stumbling over the ""lying pens"" part of the verse. With context provided by verses before and after 8:8 we can see he's talking about the aforementioned scribes personal work and not what we have presently.  While it's true that before the printing press all books were recorded by hand and there are over 5000 different handwritten manuscripts each with minor variations making up the Bible, however, in 1947(?) we found the dead sea scrolls and can see just how little and Insignificant those variations were.

@zoybean," @Chrislav7  We have found too many discrepancies within the Bible. Council of Nicea, Paul's dream, and no, the Dead Sea Scrolls have some portions which are the same and others which are extremely different.

Try to use shorter sentences and stick to a single subject for each one. I think we'll make a high school GED level writer out of you yet!

It’s only in recent years that Islamophobes have brought it up as a point of debate!  ‏Non-muslim Quraish leaders, the ones that had their leadership status at risk, and were going to be equal to slaves after living their whole life as proud and honorable leaders, that also had their fortune at risk, because Islam doesn't allow idols trade, the ones that waited for prophet Muhammed's smallest of mistakes to point fingers at him, didn't say anything about Aishia’s marriage!!  ‏Shouldn't those people that viewed Islam as a much larger and more personal threat, than you do, be the ones that argue about Aisha’s marriage?!?!  ‏As a matter of fact, for hundreds of years, absolutely no one argued about prophet Muhammad's marriage!!!  ‏Do you think that this matter was absent from all atheists, Christians, and others for hundreds of years?!  ‏The person that figured this out as a point of debate must be a damn genius!  ‏2-Shouldn’t Aisha herself say something about the marriage? Who has more right to deny this marriage? ‏Is it Aisha herself and her family and tripe?

@Adam-nq3hv,"Christopher Nichols  At the time of the Quranic revelation to prophet Muhammad, the Quran challenged all Arabs to bring anything like the Quran, and they couldn't. If the Quran is stolen from the Bible or the Torah, the Jewish or Christian Arab scholars of that time would’ve pointed that out, but they didn't. No Jews or Christians ever claimed that the Quranic text is taken from their holy texts, because they knew the obvious distinction between the two, whether in legislations or beliefs in the Quran. And no Arab of that time ever said that this Quran came from prophet Muhammed, because they know their language(Arabic) very well, instead Quraish leaders, and the opposers of prophet Muhammed choose to call him a wizard and a liar instead, and have wars with him.

@Adam-nq3hv,"Christopher Nichols  There are thousands of religions in the world, including the ones you mentioned, but that shouldn't be a problem since the vast sweeping majority of this religion, are earthly religions made by humans, pagan religions, or fabricated religions such as Sikh and Baha'i without any significant evidence. What remains in our research are religions that say they are inspired by God and have not yet been excluded, such as: Islam, Christianity, Judaism and Hinduism. Also, we can exclude Judaism because of its non-missionary national nature, with additional flaws to be mentioned with Christianity. Finally, we will also exclude Hinduism as a religion full of myths and explicit scholarly errors, without a specific founder, they have no specific religious reference, it is made up of many combinations of different cultures, philosophies, and tribal customs, which have no support.  After this introduction Let us get into the advantages of the Islamic religion.  What is the first thing we ask about if we are presented with several books that are supposed to be from God?  THE FIRST QUESTION:WHERE DID YOU THIS FROM?   That is, tell me about the sanad (support) of these books, which guarantees to me that they did not distort! Then we will find that all religions will fall into the first test, which is the Sanad exam, and we will see that the Islamic religion is the only religion that will pass this obstacle.  1) The Islamic religion (the Qur’an and the Sunnah) is the only religion that has a continuous connection without the presence of anonymous narrators, and it is known where it was written and when it was written.  2) The Islamic yen is the only religion written in the arms of a strong, cohesive country (Rashidun and umayyad caliphata) which is to be an important factor in protecting it from distortion unlike other religions.  3)The language in which the Islamic religion is descended is still a living language spoken by a very large number of creation. This does not require translation, which leads to more distortion.  4)Another issue regarding the connection of the Islamic bond of religion is the delivery of Murad(purpose/intention) of the Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, from many verses and hadiths that may bear more than one meaning or can be misunderstood. This process is carried out by his esteemed companions who lived through the revelation of revelation, and therefore they are best able to understand exactly what is meant by him. Then all of this is transferred by the bond that is connected to us.",5년 전,3,

@Adam-nq3hv,"Twilight living   You have posted 3 replies. 1-to me 2-to the guy with a Hebrew name 3-to me  But one thing though before I proceed to reply to your 3 replies, thing that I need to get off my chest. Christianity!!  This is a common theme in your replies, are you a Christian? If yes then Christianity is nothing better than Islam! It never says in the Bible that marrying 9-year-olds is prohibited!! Not a single sentence! Not even a sentence that tells you the minimum age of marriage!  Maryam the mother of your God married Saint Joseph, the 91-years-old man when she was 12 years old!  Didn't Ahaz, the king of Judah marry when he was 10 years old, and became a father when he was 11?  Didn't the Bible version of Lot make incest with his two daughters?  Didn't the Bible version of David make adultery with the wife of one of his soldiers?  Didn't Solomon pretend like he is a pagan to satisfy his pagan wifes?   Ok, now that out of the way, let's start viewing the 3 replies.  the first, you claim that I said Islam is the oldest religion in history, Islam is, obviously, not the oldest religion in history, although in Islam, we believe that Adam, Jesus and Abraham, and all prophets were Muslims, so basically, according to Islam, it is the oldest religion in the world, but however, also according to Islam, disbelievers have changed and distorted the books that Allah sent to them, like the Jews (Torah) and the Christians (Bible), and claim the distorted books are the word of God  However, I never said Islam is the oldest religion in the world, you're putting words inside my mouth!  The second reply:-  You and I quote said, “ Wow so even then he was called a charlatan and liar and stole holy texts from...”  The guy with the Hebrew name asked you to site him evidence that prophet Muhammad was accused of stealing from the Torah and the Bible, you didn't give him the evidence. Also, what's the evidence he was called a charlatan The third reply:-  Complain to her family, or basically anyone, or refuse the marriage, Aisha herself decided and agreed to marry prophet Muhammed, no one forced her to.  She once said ”If the slave-women reaches 9-year-old she is a woman”  (It won't be written down) ? The books of hadith mention numerous accounts of the prophet being criticized, insulted, beaten, debated and being called a liar, wizard...ETC Why wouldn’t she complaining be written down? Especially that Aishah narrated a LOT of hadiths from Prophet Muhammed! She's considered one of the most narrating companions of the prophet.  I am not a preacher of Islam in England or London or elsewhere, I'm a high school student that actually uses his brain a little.  Also, Islam doesn't tell people to forgive?  (Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly.)  And prophet Muhammed didn't love his wifes?  {And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought} (Ar-Rum 30:21)  Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “The most complete of the believers in faith, is the one with the best character. And the best of you are those who are best to their women.”  You don't live in England and ETC?  That shouldn't be a problem since Islam is a universal religion! It's for all people from all ethnicities!  Aishah's mother had no chance...ETC?  First, where is your evidence? Second, you realize Aishah’s mother and father were Muslims right? That means they believe that prophet Mohamed is the best a human can possibly be!  About beating and bruises... It's clear that you were brainwashed mate. In Islam, it is prohibited to bruise your wife, when ”beating” her. Let me explain. Beating wife in Islam is only allowable when there is absolutely no other choice to control the wife’s harmful behavior and beating is for learning and sermon, not for revenge, even when beating, a Muslim is prohibited to beat his wife in the face!  The prophet said:  ”If one of you were to hit, he should avoid the face...”  and   (( Men are in charge of women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband’s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance - [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.))

They beat him for marrying a little girl, great but where is your evidence? And no Wizard is not close enough to a thief, that steals texts from other books, Arabs at the time of prophet Muhammed never accused him of stealing, if you disagree give an evidence or activate silent mode.  Jesus was born through immaculate conception, great where did I say he didn’t?  Mary marrying Joseph means she is capable of having sex, but willingly didn’t, and that doesn’t deny my main point, which you ignored, your God didn’t say it’s prohibited to marry 9-years-old girls, and didn’t even bother to set a minimum age for marriage, so are you more chivalrous than your God? Do you care more about Aishah than her own family? And what about other prophets I mentioned? Why did you ignore them?  All what I say is bullshit and lies? Yes of course you would say that, because you’re losing your arguments one by one, so you accuse me of lying. 🤥   The hijab is to hide humans, yes of course, did I say it didn’t? It is to hide females from the eyes of those who wants to take pleasure in looking at them. Are you OK with knowing that someone you don’t know is lusting over your sister? If yes then you’re the exception, a lot of people out there don’t accept that.  (If you are a man who tries to convert you must fail over again)  I don’t understand this sentence.  (Even saying Jesus was a Muslim) That’s not a lie, I told you what the Quran says, it says Jesus is a Muslim, there is no room for lying really because there are many verses in the Quran that says Jesus was a Muslim.  (Hence Jesus was mentioned 25 times in the Quran, while prophet Muhammed name was only mentioned 5 times)  Also it’s not just what the Quran says, it’s also what the Bible doesn’t say. Yes you know what I am talking about, the Bible never says Jesus was a Christian, Your Bible doesn’t say that Christianity is the only true religion, unlike the Quran that says in many verses that Islam is the only true religion, in fact the word Christianity is never mentioned in your Bible!  And to take things one step further, the Bible never says Jesus was god, not does it mention the word trinity!Not once!!!   (If the Torah is older than the Quran then how come that the Torah copies the quran) I never said that mate, also you asked in your previous reply, if the Quran is older than the Torah the how come that there would be people that say Quran is stolen from Torah, you are contradicting yourself.",5년 전,0,

This book has been translated into French Abu al-Qasim Ubayd Allah bin Abdullah Ibn Khordaziba (820-912 CE) is a historian and geographer famous for his geographic book The Book of Tracts and Kingdoms, in which he described the distances between countries and he worked in the service of the Abbasid caliph al-Maamun. [2] This scientist explicitly referred to the sphericality of the earth by saying: ""The Earth is round like a spinning ball In the last years of his life, he interrupted teaching science in the manner of the elders in that era, and from his books on history a book that revealed suspicions about the names of books and arts known to Westerners as the Latin title lexicon bibliographicum. It is one of the most important bibliographic works, this encyclopedia has monitored nearly eighteen thousand titles of heritage books.  His four books are: His huge bibliographical dictionary, which he developed in the Arabic language and which surrounds all branches of science and literature, then his basic travel in general geography in the Turkish language, and finally two works in the Turkish language that have a more specialized nature, one of which is a modified form of a European atlas of the near era and the other is a historical workbook Closely related to navigation geography Al-Biruni is considered one of the greatest scholars known in the medieval Islamic era, his knowledge included physics, mathematics and natural sciences, and he had a prominent position as a historian, linguist and chronology scientist. [8] Al Biruni studied almost all fields of science, and his research and hard work were rewarded. [9] His royal court and powerful members of society sought him to urge him to conduct scientific research, study, and uncover some matters. Al-Biruni lived during the golden age of Islam, where scientific research took place alongside the methodology and thinking of Islamic religion. In addition to this type of influence, al-Biruni was also influenced by other nations, such as the Greeks, from whom he was inspired by his studies of philosophy. [10] Al Biruni was speaking in algorithm, Persian, Arabic, Greek, Sanskrit, Hebrew, and Syriac languages. Al-Biruni spent most of his time in Ghazni, which became the capital of Ghaznoyan, and is currently located in the eastern center of Afghanistan. Al-Biruni traveled to South Asia and wrote a study on Indian culture, ""Achieving the Acceptable or Sentiment of India by India"" after exploring Hinduism practiced in India. Al-Biruni is nicknamed ""the founder of the Indian or the Indian flag."" He was also known for his objective writings on the customs and beliefs of many nations. He was called a professor due to his unprecedented description of India at the beginning of the eleventh century Al-Khwarizmi contributed to mathematics, geography, astronomy, and cartography, and laid the foundation for innovation in algebra and trigonometry. His systematic method of solving linear and quadratic equations led to algebra, a word derived from the title of his book on this topic, abbreviated in the computation of algebra and corresponding.  The book of addition and differentiation in the Indian account in the year 825 AD, where he was primarily responsible for spreading the Indian numbering system throughout the Middle East and Europe.  The word (Khwarizm) was translated into the Latin language Algoritmi de numero Indorum. From his nickname Al-Khwarizmi, where the Latin word Algoritmi came, which led to the popularity of the term ""algorithm"".  Al-Khwarizmi organized and corrected Ptolemy's data on Africa and the Middle East. His main books include ""The Image of the Earth"", in which he presents the coordinates of the places that are based on the geography of Ptolemy but with improved values ​​for the Mediterranean, Asia and Africa. He also wrote about astronomical devices",5년 전,0,

I don't steal, lie or cheat because those are dishonest, and i value trust. I don't believe being good simply to appease a god is true good, true good is wanting to do good for the sake of good.

Trump is the president. Although he isn’t the greatest, he was and is the best candidate, in my personal opinion.   On a side note; there is no definite validation that the folk shown in the video voted for President Trump. Which, therefore, proves your comment to be a rather dumb one. As it has no factual information or evidence proving it to be true or even slightly accurate.   P.

Yes, I agree that our country has it’s faults, but every country does. Some much greater than others. We are quite lucky to be here, in my opinion.   So, if Sikhism is easily known to children if they had a world history class, as you’ve said—then how come the whole point of the video is that children aren’t being educated on the small religion? I ask you, do you even know where Sikhism is based? Searching it on the internet doesn’t count.   Why do you hate Donald Trump? I don’t need the basic reason or the fine-grained details—just a solid explanation on why you didn’t (or wouldn’t of) voted for him. If you don’t hate him, then please pardon my assumption, but I figure that you at least disliked him as a candidate.   Ironically, your reply was very uninformative and insignificant (or invalid). With an opening like that I expected your response to have some meaningful opinion or belief that goes against mine.

If you believe our country’s education system is failing to meet the standards of other countries, that is fine as well. You are entitled to your opinion. However, your unsophisticated and lowbrowed accusations of those who vote for the right-wing, aren’t easy to ignore.   I presume you are young and that, like most, formed your opinion based off of your hate for the current US president. Personally, I don’t like to make accusations that I can’t back up. I would never declare one ignorant if they’ve shown no proof of being so. And, I suppose your retort to this would be “they voted for Trump, what more proof do I need?” To answer this in advance, you need a lot more.   You have to understand that just because one casts their vote for a particular candidate, it doesn’t make one “stupid”.  I presume, you would vote democrat  (which I highly disagree with for countless reasons), but I cannot announce you stupid based on your political stance. For instance, I have a high IQ, yet I voted for Trump.   I could see how this news could be overwhelming for someone of your beliefs to hear, but it is nothing but the plain and simple truth. Political standpoint isn’t what decides a person’s intellectual development. However, I agree that it could be part of the reason Liberals tend to be more hateful and uneducated, than is presumed normal. Perhaps, their intellectual incapabilities are to blame for why they voted democrat.   You see, what I am trying to say is—be less intolerant. If you don’t soon, you may never be able to.  P. S. My response wasn’t and isn’t invalid, no matter how many times you repeat it, it won’t become true.   P. S. S. Invalid and trivial have similar definitions when it comes to the current matter. By you saying my response was “invalid”, even though nothing I stated was untrue, meant you weren’t properly using the word. I presumed that you meant it as, my comment meant nothing, which in that case, makes “trivial” a very similar word in comparison.

@ainan3180,"The best definition that any Sikh can give regarding the concept of God in Sikhism is to quote the Mulmantra – the fundamental creed of Sikhism, which occurs at the beginning of Sri Guru Granth Sahib.  It is mentioned in Sri Guru Granth Sahib, volume 1 Japuji, the first verse:  ""There exists but one God, who is called The True, The Creator, Free from fear and hate, Immortal, Not begotten, Self-Existent, Great and Compassionate.""  Sikhism is a monotheistic Religion  Sikhism enjoins its followers to practise strict monotheism. It believes in only One Supreme God who is, in the unmanifest form, called Ek Omkara.  In the manifest form He is called Omkara and has several attributes such as:  Kartar – The Creator Akal – The Eternal Sattanama – The Holy Name Sahib – The Lord Parvardigar – The Cherisher Rahim – The Merciful Karim – The Benevolent  He is also called Wahe Guru – the One true God.  Besides Sikhism being strictly monotheistic, it also does not believe in Avataravada – the doctrine of incarnation. Almighty God does not incarnate Himself in what is known as Avatara. Sikhism is also strongly against idol worship.   Guru Nanak was influenced by Sant Kabir  Guru Nanak was influenced by the sayings of Sant Kabir so much that several chapters of Sri Guru Granth Sahib contain couplets of Sant Kabir.  One of the famous couplets of Sant Kabir is:  ""Dukh mein sumirana sabh karein Sukh mein karein na koya Jo sukh mein sumirana karein To dukh kaye hoye?""  ""In times of trouble, God is remembered by all But none remembers Him during peace and happiness. If God is remembered in good times of happiness Why should trouble occur?""  Compare this with the following verse of the Qur’an:  ""When some trouble toucheth man, He crieth unto his Lord, Turning to Him in repentance: But when He bestoweth A favour upon him As from Himself, (Man) doth forget what he cried And prayed for before, And he doth set up Rivals unto Allah."" [Al-Qur’an 39:8]  The Sikh scriptures therefore emphasise monotheism and God-consciousness. ....",5년 전,0,

Our sikh gurus were NOT against Islam .. they were against the rulers of that time using islam as a tool and were doing crime.. and thats why they opposed and gave their lives. In today's world Hindus take this for granted that sikhs were born to protect ONLY Hindus and Sikhs couldn't help or stand with Muslim .. this stereotype and misinformation needs to be gone for good.

Many cultures have 'arrived' in the West over the millennia, all have assimulated... yes indeed you can find 'pockets' of tradition...but they are only pockets. The allure of modernity and the 'material' trapping that has to offer beguiles, entices and corrupts.   If it hasn't yet been corrupted...it just hasn't been exposed long enough.

Celebrating culture can be inclusive...sadly not all cultures seem to have that capacity. The Europen Union is our 'collective' and as such, I certainly want to be part of it...but as an Irishman. Peace is without any doubt the one thing everyone should cherish most...and I would defer to your understanding of the situation on the ground. From the outside, I have to admit intolerance seems to have a stronghold in certain parts of India...that saddens me greatly...we've had our own problems (with intolerance) here. So I know how damaging that can be... India is so big and a population beyond my wildest imagination...harmony has to be a challenge... I'm kinda of the opinion ""Good fences make good neighbors""   World cities like London and New York are the exceptions...melting pots of humanity all living cheek by jowl...I hope that is the future of my city Dublin but that's more an asperation than certainty... The trick is self-confidence when you are secure in who you are...you are a lot less likely to feel threatened by others...not an easy thing to achieve when you've been the victim of imperialism...

@blackfire6130," Santha  In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful  The verse 9:29 is a command to fight the Byzantine Romans and other hostile powers who were planning an invasion against the Muslims in Arabia. In context, it is a distinct response to aggression, in particular the assassination of one of the Prophet’s ambassadors.  Allah said:  قَاتِلُوا الَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَلَا بِالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ وَلَا يُحَرِّمُونَ مَا حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ وَلَا يَدِينُونَ دِينَ الْحَقِّ مِنَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ حَتَّىٰ يُعْطُوا الْجِزْيَةَ عَن يَدٍ وَهُمْ صَاغِرُونَ  Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not acknowledge the religion of truth from those who were given the Scripture, until they give the tribute willingly while they are humbled.  Surah At-Tawba 9:29  On the surface, this appears to be an open-ended command to fight non-Muslims until they are conquered. However, a fundamental principle of Quranic exegesis (tafseer) is that the verses must be understood in the context in which they were revealed (asbab an-nuzul) and in conjunction with other verses delineating the rules of warfare.  At-Tabari and other commentators record that this verse was revealed concerning the expedition of Tabuk.  At-Tabari records:  عَنْ مُجَاهِدٍ قَاتِلُوا الَّذِينَ لا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَلا بِالْيَوْمِ الآخِرِ… حِينَ أُمِرَ مُحَمَّدٌ وَأَصْحَابُهُ بِغَزْوَةِ تَبُوكَ  Mujahid reported concerning the verse, “Fight those who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day…” that it was revealed when Muhammad and his companions were commanded with the expedition of Tabuk.  Source: Tafseer At-Tabari 9:29  The expedition of Tabuk was preceded by the battle of Mu’tah which began when the emissary of the Prophet was assassinated while delivering a letter to a Roman ally.  Ibn Al-Qayyim writes:  وَكَانَ سَبَبُهَا أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ بَعَثَ الحارث بن عمير الأزدي أَحَدَ بَنِي لِهْبٍ بِكِتَابِهِ إِلَى الشَّامِ إِلَى مَلِكِ الرُّومِ أَوْ بُصْرَى فَعَرَضَ لَهُ شرحبيل بن عمرو الغساني فَأَوْثَقَهُ رِبَاطًا ثُمَّ قَدَّمَهُ فَضَرَبَ عُنُقَهُ وَلَمْ يُقْتَلْ لِرَسُولِ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ رَسُولٌ غَيْرُهُ فَاشْتَدَّ ذَلِكَ عَلَيْهِ حِينَ بَلَغَهُ الْخَبَرُ فَبَعَثَ الْبُعُوثَ  The cause of the battle was that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, sent Harith ibn Umair Al-Azdi of the tribe of Lihb with his letter to Syria for the Roman king or Busra. He presented it to Sharhabeel ibn Amr Al-Ghassani and he bound him and struck his neck. Never had an ambassador of the Messenger of Allah been killed besides him. The Prophet was upset by that when news reached him and he dispatched an expedition.  Source: Zaad Al-Ma’ad 336  Safiur Rahman writes:  The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, had sent Al-Harith ibn Umair Al-Azdi on an errand to carry a letter to the ruler of Busra. On his way, he was intercepted by Sharhabeel ibn Amr Al-Ghassani, the governor of Al-Balqa and a close ally to Caesar, the Byzantine Emperor. Al-Harith was tied and beheaded by Al-Ghassani.  Source: The Sealed Nectar p. 245  This was the first act of Roman aggression that further led to the expedition of Tabuk concerning which the verse 9:29 was revealed. The verse describes the aggressors as those “who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day,” because they committed this act of treachery. Executing emissaries from other countries is a war crime that could never be committed by those who sincerely believe in God.  Anas ibn Malik reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said:  لَا إِيمَانَ لِمَنْ لَا أَمَانَةَ لَهُ وَلَا دِينَ لِمَنْ لَا عَهْدَ لَهُ  There is no faith for one who cannot be trusted. There is no religion for one who cannot uphold a covenant.  Source: Musnad Ahmad 11975, Grade: Hasan  Safiur Rahman further describes the reason the conflict took place:  The Byzantine power, which was considered the greatest military force on earth at that time, showed an unjustifiable opposition towards Muslims. As we have already mentioned, their opposition started at killing the ambassador of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, Al-Harith ibn Umair Al-Azdi, by Sharhabeel ibn Amr Al-Ghassani. The ambassador was then carrying a message from the Prophet to the ruler of Busra. We have also stated that the Prophet consequently dispatched a brigade under the command of Zaid bin Haritha, who had a fierce fight against the Byzantines at Mu’tah. Although Muslim forces could not have revenge on those haughty overproud tyrants, the confrontation itself had a great impression on the Arabs all over Arabia.  Caesar, who could neither ignore the great benefit that the battle of Mu’tah had brought to Muslims, nor could he disregard the Arab tribes’ expectations of independence and their hopes of getting free from his influence and reign, nor he could ignore their alliance to the Muslims. Realizing all that, Caesar was aware of the progressive danger threatening his borders, especially the fronts of Syria which were neighboring Arab lands. So he concluded that demolition of the Muslims’ power had grown an urgent necessity. This decision of his should, in his opinion, be achieved before the Muslims become too powerful to conquer and raise troubles and unrest in the adjacent Arab territories.  To meet these exigencies, Caesar mustered a huge army of the Byzantines and pro-Roman Ghassanite tribes to launch a decisive bloody battle against the Muslims.  Source: The Sealed Nectar p. 272  Therefore, this context must be understood when reading verse 9:29 so that we clearly know who should be fought, specifically the aggressors among the Jews and Christians and not all of them. Rather, many other verses of the Quran make clear that it is unlawful to initiate hostilities against other nations.  Allah said:  وَقَاتِلُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ الَّذِينَ يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ وَلَا تَعْتَدُوا إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الْمُعْتَدِينَ  Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress. Verily, Allah does not love transgressors.",5년 전,6,

As a Jain I don’t consider Hindus as brothers coz of the violence and wars, and I haven’t studied too much about Sikhs. You know what imma put Sikhs in the same category as Jains and Buddhists but slightly more distant. P.S. Atheists and Agnostics should love Jainism and Buddhism we are statistically the most peaceful religion and that’s fax. Meanwhile the Abrahamic religions are the most violent. Hinduism is violent but has some better teachings, once again don’t know too much about Sikhism, and then there’s Buddhism and Jainism. And if u atheists don’t like us that’s fine too I do support ur guy’s efforts to debunk the Abrahamic religions.",5년 전,1,

Even more so in places like airports or train stations. Everyone utilizes visual ques (most of the time subconsciously) to assimilate things.

@jdwillso5217,"Locus Cades Well, maybe be more clear next time because you said America, not the United States. I understand what you’re saying about family values and religion but in the United States life doesn’t work that way. However, that doesn’t mean specific religions HATE the United States, they just have different values. Yes, the US is a capitalist society where anyone can grow their wealth if need be but it’s not right to say that the US is a terrible and, as you say, hated country for those reasons. It’s just a difference of opinion and values. It’s not right to say that the United States is a terrible country just because your religion says otherwise. I’d argue that the US values family traditions more than others might think. That’s exactly why some businesses are not open on Sunday’s. You might not like when people go out and buy food on a Sunday but that’s your own view of the subject. And to be clear, Chick-Fil-A isn’t open on Sunday’s, either. You make it sound like people working on Sunday are forced to be there but that’s not how the United States works. We’re a country focused on growing wealth, so of course some businesses will be open on Sunday. If a worker hates the idea of working on a Sunday, they can easily quit their job and go home to their family without repercussion, that’s why the US values family traditions.",5년 전,0,

Saying that religion hates it is to say that it has a vendetta against the type of system that has resulted in some areas seeing families not being able to pay their bills and being honestly in a bad place.

Muslims believe that both religion were made by God's Messengers but the last religion Islam. Note that Muslims believe that Islam has been a religion for as long as time from Adam's time to modern-day, however it was revealed over a long period of time and through many Messiah/Prophets including Jesus and Moses and other Mesasih.

@Allinda.,"Jesus was middle eastern with middle eastern look (middle eastern skin colour go from white""not pink European white"" to light brown) and they get darker if they live in the desert under the sun everyday 24h or work outside , he was Jewish so he look like the mizrahi jews and the Arabd because Arabs and jews are cousins both semitic from the same origin both speak semitic languages, also look like the other semitic in the middle East like phonicians if they still exists and Assyrian and Canaanites , i know many Assyrian from syria and iraq and they don't look different than the Arabs by look they look the same and both have brown skinned people and white skinned people in the same family and have similar features nothing different, except that alot of Levantine people mixed with European or kurdish or turkman or Armenian people that's why some could pass as European that is because they are not 100% Levantine semitic they have European blood and dna in them , also alot of people from yemen and Kuwait mixed with African people that's why they could look darker because they have African dna in them and other Arabs like Bahrain Uae Kuwait have millions of people from Pakistani origin and balochi from Balochistan originally and also Iranian and they all call themselves Arabs because they born and raised with Arabs as Arabs because their ancestors settled in Arab countries long time ago so they only feel Arab and don't care about their original land , in Saudi Arabia you will people from All origin from the African who were slaves to other Muslims from india Pakistan mynamar (burma) and other Asian countries , because it was a dream to their ancestors to go to the prophet Muhammad land and to live and die there and that's what they did long years ago, alot of them go to do hajj and never go back to there home land so their children and grandchildren and their (progeny , offspring , parentage) , they would call themselves Arabs and wear like Arabs and speak like them and generation by generation they lose everything contact them with their ancestors Homeland, but they still not Arabs and don't look Arabs or semitic or middle eastern but people think this is how real Arabs look , and people look at the Armenian and circassians, Chechen,greek, turkman, kurdish in the Levant and think this is how real pure Levantine semitic look like which is also wrong , alot of Levantine mixed with European they still mix with them until this day so not anyone born in the levant or have Levantine father means he is 100% semitic pure Levantine or means his origin is from Levant just because he born there, Lebanese are the most people who are mixed with European and obsessed with trying to look European and do whatever European do , most if not All miss Lebanon winners are from not Lebanese mother mostly European mother, even the only Lebanese who won miss world she was half Hungarian so her mother is European, most of the famous Lebanese actresses and singers are originally was the winners of miss Lebanon, they saw them pretty so they made them the most famous Lebanese singer and acctres and even tv hosts just because of the look even though lot's of Lebanese don't look like them , so don't look at today's most white Levantine and think Jesus look like him because the most white Levantine are for sure mixed with European and have more European dna than semitic or middle eastern. (Middle eastern white skin is not like European white skin , only some Spanish Italian and Portuguese have similar skin to middle eastern) .

Just look at the happiest and most prosperous countries in the world, they’re statistically the most Atheistic/Agnostic countries in the world.  The whole French Revolution thing (Again, for the sake of the argument I will address it as the Enlightenment) you see, Robespierre may have been an Atheist, but he wasn’t guided by the principles of the Enlightenment (Science and Rationality), the endless massacre and chaos that ensured the country weren’t a product of atheism, it was a product of blatant ignorance and manipulation at the hands of people like him.  And at the end of the day, Human nature isn’t the cause of death and hate, Ignorance is, things like religion, money, and being recognized is behind basic human goals like: Fulfillment, Pleasure, and at the end of the day Happiness. When a person is removed of any direct punishment or proof that he is causing pain and chaos, that individual will blame it or explain it with ignorance. “Gays are hated god”, “blacks are resistant to pain and need to have a master”, “Immigrants are the main cause of an economic collapse” are the main driving forces for hate because people tend to ignore the reality.

Regarding the origin of hate, murder, jealousy, rape and so on. I can tell you one thing, i've been searching for a long time what could lead to such a behaviour. Only one answer up to today and it was money. Today it's money made from paper, yesterday from silver and before that from gold.

You may say that Religion is actually teaching its followers to do kind acts, and that’s amazing, but Religion sadly uses Dogma and not Rationality to teach morality.  Secondly, Money is not the cause of Rape, Murder, Thievery, etc. (It may be a source for Robbery and related activities). But how come the majority of people (I may say 95%) have never murdered someone? How come the majority of people have never raped someone? How come since the start of times and even on animals when money didn’t exist Robbery was a thing? It’s simple because US as humans have something that few other animals have: Morality. Ignorance is the source of problems, when you ignore the harm you do when you steal, you do it. When you ignore the pain you do when killing someone because they’re someone you don’t understand (I.e. Prostitutes, Queers, Members of another Ethnicity, etc.), you do it. Are you starting to get my point? Most Animals don’t understand this, cause they can’t, they don’t have the ability to Rationalize, that’s why they steal, kill and rape. But us as humans, we have Rationality and Morality, so, when you ignore the consequences of your actions, you are being a victim of Ignorance, such as Nationalism, Patriarchy, Homophobia, Religion, Dogma, and Xenophobia to generalize.",5년 전,5,

I understand what you are saying by having rationality and morality, but those are affected by emotion which is greater in term of influence than others. That's why i've tell you that money is the main problem. If everyone would get everything like a home, food, car & so on and the work required behind is the same for everyone.  Many frustration would disappear, since people have this issue of being jealous of each others. And just not having the feel of fear for tomorrow, because you could be fired from your job or having an accident that would cost ten of thousand dollars to heal from..

We reached the existential crisis that Nietzche warned us of of when technological advancement conflicts with the human self-image created through humanity’s relation with the mystic higher order. In an era where science has driven us closer to realizing ourself as just more complicated physical systems, people are more strongly clinging to religion to give themselves purpose- there are those who through greater social and academic education have solidified a purpose for themselves, but really it’s because we rehashed older religious morals in a more humanistic context, thereby still making morality dogmatic.

Anyone who was supposed to be all powerful and able to predict the future would know that its own rules would get ""outdated"" and that society would change. So an all powerful god should be able to previously explain in its book that an updated would be necessary in a certain time or its rules would be so perfect that it would be timeless and could work at every moment regardless on how much changes society would have.   Call for an update is say that humans will change what God did, but humans are limited anyways. How could humans improve what was done by God ?   It only makes sense if you admit that the people that came up with those ideas would never guess how the world would change, therefore they would not guess that torture and other barbarities would be seen as wrong.   Also those ideas only represent ideas of the mentality of the time it was written. People were more violent, therefore capital punishment was more reasonable, people had less hygiene and less knowledge on medicine, therefore its reasonable to not allow eating certain food such as pork (pigs eat anything and could easily trasmitt infections they've gotten and kill people) or seafood (animals like shrimp have high levels of magnification of certain molecules or can be harmful to those allergic).

@masterv1be815,"@Oricand The verse of the Holy Quran is often mentioned to malign Islam. The verse does not say infidels it says idolaters. (9:5) And when the forbidden months have passed, kill the idolaters wherever you find them and take them prisoners, and beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they repent and observe Prayer and pay the Zakat, then leave their way free. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful.  This verse, chapter 9 verse 5, is often used as evidence that Islam allows killing of non-Muslims, but what is not recognized is the context and history behind these verses. The history of this verse is that when Prophet Muhammad(sa) began preaching the unity of God he was persecuted for 13 years, much as Prophets Abraham and Jesus were. Since Muslims who are being persecuted are encouraged to leave for safer areas, rather than create disorder, Muhammad(sa) and his followers migrated to Medina. After they left, the Meccans attacked them in Medina on and off for a period of nine years until Chapter 9 was revealed.  Looking at the context of the verses, it becomes obvious that the commandment of this verse only relates to those tribes who continued hostilities against the Muslims even after they had migrated. In particular, reference is made to 5 tribes (‘Banu Khuza’ah, Banu Mudlij, Banu Bakr, Banu Damrah, and Banu Sulaiim) that did not honor the treaties they made with Muslims. It is also important to remember that the preceding verses give these people respite for 4 months to reconsider their behavior and cease hostilities. Sadly after 4 months passed, the enemies of Islam continued their hostilities against the Muslims. Only then was Prophet Muhammad(sa) commanded by God to meet them in battle to defend Muslims and the religion of Islam.  Even in this situation the Quran states that if the enemies repent of their behavior and promise to fulfill their treaties, it becomes incumbent on Muslims to cease military action and forgive them. Unfortunately those who take this specific verse out of context fail to see that as the title Al-Taubah suggests, the main subject matter of the chapter is forgiveness and repentance.   this should explain it",5년 전(수정됨),4,

The Quran based religion is strictly rigid with no room to wiggle and the more it tries to tie down the followers, the more dissent grows amongst them. There are one billion people who are reading the same text and extracting completely different meanings and instructions from it. They are expected to blindly believe without seeking knowledge for themselves. You’ll find more and more how Muslims are aggressively defensive about their belief because any form of deviation makes them feel like Islam is falling apart. They haven’t been taught to question, analyze, and understand. Blind faith is what is expected and allowed. The other Abrahamic religions are the same but they’re not bothered about being the best in the competition.   To the good Muslims, Why claim the religion is the best and the most perfect for eternity and then curse when its obvious flaws are pointed out? Nobody is forcing you to make such bombastic claims.

Please tell me HOW Khadijah could have a thriving business with so many men working under her while she had divorce from her husband in Jahiliah? Where did she get those rights? If there were already such rights in place, then Islam didn’t make anything better for women. It just made it 100 times worse! Took away women’s rights and powers.   HOW the men in that era could have 20-30 wives if most of the girl children were murdered? WHERE did they come from?? This is very serious contradiction because logic doesn’t make sense here.

Confidence sans knowledge is dangerous. It also seems clear that you blindly believe in religious statements to which you have not applied your own understanding. It’s okay though. That’s how most religions works in the world and propaganda too. It’s wrongful when you come to show off your limited comprehension with an air of false determination.  The Amina hadees is Sahih and you know it. You just don’t want to admit. I never said the prophet pled to Allah. I asked WHY DIDN’T HE ? He negotiated with Allah for the number of Namaz times and also kept Umar’s request to download ayat for covering the women.  Yet Allah’s favorite prophet did not plea for his own mother who sacrificed her life to show him the world.   Calm down there mate. You can’t come here brandishing the glory of Islam and then slip away saying you’re not sure or you don’t know. You don’t question and you don’t discuss. These are important for securing brainwashed followers who can’t think for themselves.   “Maybe they kept enough for themselves”. Through which amazing psychic abilities did these Arabs determine how many female children are being born and who will eventually be married off to a polygamist? I’m not saying female infanticide didn’t happen. It probably did as they also happen today. But to paint Islam as the noble rescuer for women is pretty far-fetched.   You bring up slavery which is funny. This could be off topic but Islam the ONLY religion that permits, condones, and propagates slavery. It is halal. Ask your imam. Anyway, the things you mentioned about family life seems to be identical to women’s role in Sura Nisa. What they lost is their ability to marry whoever they like (outside of religion), their power to earn their living (man is given this role), their authority to take decisions (husband’s permission to divorce). I already said how historical research (not Islamic history) yields that early Arab households were governed by females just like many other early civilizations. Modern day Saudi allowed women to drive just a year ago. Yes, I will hold Saudi inextricable to Islam. That’s where Jahiliah was and that’s the birthplace of Islam. They have the Shahada on their flag. Saudi is Islam. One of the greatest example of the complete implementation of Islam and it’s scary as hell!   I’ve written enough and you get my point.

About Aminah. There are debates on this topic that doesnt have a clear winner,atleast to me . But even if you take it as shahih ,he pleaded to Allah and he was not given premission  ""The Prophet had visited his mother's grave, then he cried and made the people who were beside him also cried then he said, 'I had asked permission from my Lord to ask forgiveness for him (his mother) but I was not given permission, and I asked permission to visit her grave (his mother) then Allah gave me permission.  Make a pilgrimage because (the pilgrimage of the grave) can remind you of death. '”(Narrated by Muslim Imam in his Shahîh (976–977).  I already aswered this question yet wouldnt read it. I said that if she were to be prayed. Then she would immedietly go to heaven because the prayer of a mulim child to their parents is one of the ways to go to heaven. This is Muhammad were talking about the greatest human in Allah prespective. It would be a no brainer that she would go to heaven. So what does that imply? She went to hell? No that just means he couldnt pray for her. When in fact that is one of things you should do as a child ""Whoever is tested by getting childrens then he does good to them (by educating him) then the girl will be a barrier for him from the touch of hellfire."" (Narrated by Bukhari and Muslim). This is why the imam have a debate on this. She was a good mother yet people say he went to hell, thats why im not sure because i dont want to spread misinformation.     Oh islam is not a rescuer of women? Proof women were treated wrong  ""And they appointed unto God daughters.  Glory to Allah, while for themselves (they determine) what they like (that is, sons).  And if someone of them is given news with (birth) a daughter, black (red goes) his face, and he is very angry.  He hid himself from the crowd, because of the bad news conveyed to him.

Shaykh Abu Bakar Jabir Al Jaza-iri hafizhohullah explained, ""The origins of slavery (im general) were due to the following reasons:   The war [الحرب]  If a group of people fights another group of people and succeeds in defeating it, then they make the women and children of the group they defeat to be slaves.   Faithfulness [الفقر]  It is not infrequent that poverty drives people to sell their children to be made slaves to other humans.   Robbery and piracy [الإختطاف بالتلصص و القرصة]  In the past a large group of European nations stopped in Africa and captured Negroes, then sold them in European slave markets.  Besides that, pirates from Europe hijacked ships that crossed the seas and attacked their passengers, and if they succeeded in defeating them, they sold their passengers on European slave markets and they ate the proceeds of their sales. ""[Minhajul Muslim p.  443, Darul Bayan, Beirut, cet.  I, 1427 H]  And in Islam because the cause of slavery is ony one namely infidels who are prisoners of war.  And it is very natural for a prisoner of war to be a slave.  Because they were previously enemies and must be given a low social strata.  Shaykh Abdullah Bin Abdurrahman Ali Bassam rahimahullah said, ""Islam states that all human beings are free and cannot be slaves except for one reason, namely infidels who are taken prisoner in battle.  And the warlords have the obligation to give proper treatment to the captives, can be made slaves, ask for ransom or release them without ransom.  It was all chosen while still seeing the general good. The treatment of slaves  1. The only cause of a muslim having a slave: infidel who is a prisoner of war  2.Orders to be kind to slaves  3.Islam elevates slaves honour  4.Prompts freeing slaves  5.The forgiveness of their sin (kafarah) if a muslim sets a slave free  6.Slaves Can ask for freedom by paying themselves / mukatabah.But there are many other ways to make slaves free  7.Slaves are helped if they want independence.

@MightyMightyMyers,"Fathur 45 You give an excellent example of how empty vessels sound much. Of course you may feel like writing a college application essay would accomplish the task of denial and deflection but you’re mistaken. Again a person who can’t save his own parents from hellfire is not fit to give any advices to another. The whole gibberish you wrote about women’s rights is truly laughable! Not only pre-Islamic women empowerment was far greater before Islam reached but the present day rights far exceeds any provision permitted by Islam. You see inheritance is not decided by gender factor but by the number of children, regardless of their genders. You still didn’t clear the air on Khadijah. Out of the oceans of Hadees, not a single mention of a women as successful as her. Last but not the least, there is no way you can justify slavery as something moral under any circumstances whatsoever. The slaves in older world were not provisioned by religion. This is the main difference. Wars, murder, slavery, rape are products of politics. They can’t be justified by something that’s meant to show a person spiritual path. Even the world wars are part of the politics, never religion. This just shows how irrevocably blind you are. You are made to sit here giving contexts and history for slavery and you are afraid to say that it’s morally wrong. It was wrong then as much as it is now. Admirable efforts though. Hope you spend just as much time focusing on the youth in your community who are led astray by the radicals and extremists. Then you won’t have to come back and give long winding justifications for what your people are doing to damage the world. Oh and last but not least. I hope you learn to see reason beyond blind faith and apply your god-given sense of analytics !",5년 전,1,

And if you want to know the details of it implore you go find it out for yourself i dont know khadijah life story. As for slavery. Did you not understand what i said. Slaves in islam are from war prisoners (people who are the enemy of islam) and yet we give them will to do whatever they want. Sure there are some limitations but its more moraly correct than the muslims prisioners you have in guantama bay.

@Flipfan84,"Hime Sama this person is lying and is using propaganda to spread hatred for his own personal opinions.  People like him love to show the scary stuff but not the explanation under the footnotes and he refuses to show this:  God does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes – from dealing kindly and justly with them.  Indeed, God loves those who act justly.  God only forbids you from those who fight you because of religion and expel you from your homes and aid in your expulsion – (forbids) that you make allies of them.  And whoever makes allies of them, then it is those who are the wrongdoers."" (Quran 60:8-9)  ""The angel Gabriel was so adamant in reminding me to be charitable with my neighbor that I thought he might make him my heir.""  Sahih Al-Bukhari   ""Beware!  Whoever is cruel and hard on a non-Muslim minority, curtails their rights, burdens them with more than they can bear, or takes anything from them against their free will; I (Prophet Muhammad) will complain against the person on the Day of Judgment."" (Abu Dawud)  ""We have honored the children of Adam; provided them with transport on land and sea; given them for sustenance things good and pure; and conferred on them special favors, above a great part of Our creation."" (Quran 17:70)  ""O mankind!  We created you from a single (pair) of a male (Adam) and female(Eve), and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know each other (and not hate one another).  Surely, the most honored of you in the sight of God is (he who) is the most righteous of you.  And God has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things)."" (Quran 49:13)  ""And dispute you not with the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) except in the best way, unless it be with those who do wrong, but say, ‘We believe in the revelation which has come down to us and in that which came down to you; our God and your God is One; and it is to Him we submit (in Islam).’"" (Quran 21:46)  Muslims were/are not to speak ill of pagan gods, or any god someone else worshiped because it might instigate others to soothe their wounded feelings by hurting the feelings of Muslims.  Such a scenario is against human dignity of both sides and would lead to mutual rejection and hatred.  God says in the Quran: ""Do not revile those whom they call upon besides God, lest they revile God out of spite in their ignorance.  Thus, We have made alluring to each people its own doings.  In the end will they return to their Lord and He shall then tell them the truth of what they did."" (Quran 6:108)  ""Let there be no compulsion in religion; truth stands clear from error: whoever rejects false gods and believes in God has grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold that never breaks.  And God hears and knows all things."" (Quran 2:256)  ""(They are) those who have been evicted from their homes without right — only because they say, ‘Our Lord is God.’  And was it not that God checks the people, some by means of others, there would have been demolished  monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which the name of God is much mentioned (praised).  And God will surely support those who support Him (meaning His cause).  Indeed, God is Powerful and Exalted in Might."" (Quran 22:40)  The Prophet of Islam declared that the life of non-Muslims residents or visitor as inviolable when he said:  ""Whoever kills a person with whom we have a treaty, will not come close enough to Paradise to smell its scent, and its scent can be found as far away as forty years of travel."" (Saheeh Al-Bukhari)  ""You must know that it is not lawful for you to take the property of the People of the Covenant unless it is (in payment) for something."" Musnad Ahmad   ""Indeed God, Mighty and Majestic, has not allowed you to enter the homes of the People of the Book except by their permission, nor has He allowed you to hit their women, nor eat their fruit if they give you what is obligatory upon them [from the jizyah]."" (Abu Dawood)  Muhammad (pbuh), His great Messenger, as pervasive and all-encompassing of mercy, whose kind behavior involved both Muslims and Non-Muslims: “And we have not sent you except as a mercy to the worlds.” Quran [21:107]   The almighty God praised the Prophet’s good temper and tolerance as follows:  “So by mercy from God [O’ Muhammad], you were lenient with them. And if you had been sever and harsh-hearted with them, they would have disbanded from about you. So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them…” [Quran 3:159]  The Companions of the Messenger of Allah who saw them said that they never saw a delegation like them after that. When it was time for their prayers, they stood up and worshiped towards east. Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said: “Do not touch them.” ….  (Al Jamiu li Ahkam al Quran, Imam Qurtubi)  … Meanwhile, since it was time for their prayers, they stood up to pray in Masjid al Saadah. Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said: “let them pray.” They prayed heading east…  And as far as how to treat women in Islam:  “O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam) and from him (Adam) He created his wife (Eve), and from them both He created many men and women and fear Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights), and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship). Surely, Allah is Ever an All-Watcher over you. "" [ Surah 4:1  That people all people men and women, were created by their Lord from a single person or self, that this self is a nucleus from which Allah created an integral counterpart that completes this original self and is completed by it, is stated in another verse: "" It is He Who has created you from a single person (Adam), and (then) He has created from him his wife (Eve), in order that he might enjoy the pleasure of living with her."" [ Surah 7:189] Eventually Allah, out of this nuclear pair, scattered the multitudes of men and women, all worshippers of a single God and children of the same parents implying they are united in a fraternity, embracing men and women alike. Because of this fact, the verse commands people to fear Allah as their Lord and be heedful of the duties that the wombs, as symbolic of this bond, impose.  The best among you is he who is best towards his wife.’ Consort with them in kindness – 4:20  And others as followed:  An apostle asked the Prophet PBUH: “O Messenger of God, among all mankind who is it that I am much obliged to glorify?” The Prophet answered, “Your mother.” “And then who else?” again the man ask. “Your mother,” again the Prophet answered. “And then who else?” the man ask for the third time. “Your mother, still answered the Prophet. “And then who else?” asked the man for the fourth time. “Your father,” at last the Prophet said.  19)  “The most perfect of believers in belief is the best of them in character.  The best of you are those who are the best to their women” Al-Tirmidhi (Hadith)  Being nice includes good communication.  A husband should be willing to open up, and be willing to listen to his wife.  Many times a husband wants to air his frustrations (like work).  He should not forget to ask her about what annoys her (like when children would not do their homework).  A husband should not talk about important things with her when he or his wife is angry, tired, or hungry.  Communication, compromise, and consideration are the cornerstone of marriage.  Being nice includes encouraging one’s wife.  The most meaningful admiration comes from a sincere heart that notices what really matters — what the wife really values.  So a husband should ask himself what she feels most insecure about and discover what she values.  That is the wife’s sweet spot of praise.  The more the husband compliments it, the more the wife will admire it, the more on target this healthy habit will be.  Kind words are like, ""I like the way you think,"" ""You look beautiful in those clothes,"" and ""I love hearing your voice on the phone.  “A believing man should not hate a believing woman.  If he dislikes something in her character, he should be pleased with some other trait of hers”  Saheeh Muslim  A companion asked the Prophet of God “what is the right of a wife over her husband?’  He said, ""That you feed her when you eat and clothe her when you clothe yourself and do not strike her face.  Do not malign her and do not keep apart from her, except in the house” Abu Daud.  In Islam when a woman works that money belongs TO HER and if she wants to spend it on her husband she gets extra blessings in this life and in the here after.  “Women were created from a rib and if you try to straighten a rib it will break so so treat women kindly” Bukhari no.3331  And there is a lot more!  The problem with people saying that they know what Islam is because they “have a Quran”(which I seriously doubt) is that what they do is go on google and search for bad things.  They also fail to mention that Islam is part of the three Abrahamic faiths (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) because they believe in the same thing!   For him to say that Islam is evil then he he is saying that Jesus, Mary, Adam, Eve, Joseph, Gabriel, Moses, Michael, Abraham ect are all evil because they are in the Quran as well. The laws are the same is all three scriptures people like him only target Islam because they fear the truth and only want to destroy it.",5년 전,1,

@siddharthraghuveeremadaboi2901," @saladsama4708  The quality of the tree is to be judged by the fruit it produces.  It matters not after that whether the tree was “intended” to produce good or bad fruit.  If the fruit is rotten or poisonous, the tree won’t be judged as being good no matter how beautiful it may seem to be externally.  Look, we can discuss what the context and intended meaning of the Quran and the hadiths are until the cows come home.  What is relevant from a practical viewpoint is what actual shape and form in which they are being implemented.  Because tell me…..  If you are being put to death as a gay person in Saudi Arabia - Does it make one jot of a difference to you that Islam was “not intended” to be that way?  And if a vicious and murderous mob of believers are about to lynch you in Pakistan or Afghanistan over a mere allegation of desecrating the Quran - Will it give you one ounce of comfort being told that what they are doing isn’t “true Islam”?  In fact even in the West, we already have a de facto form of sharia.  Think I’m exaggerating?  Okay tell me - Is there one among you in any Western nation who would so much as dare draw a cartoon of Muhammad or post a video of tearing a Quran - in the safety of your OWN nation?  Really?  This is in nations where you do have freedom of speech by the law but you still will not dare do it! And we all know why.  If that is not a de facto form of sharia imposed not by Western laws but by the sheer fear of being murdered, what is it then?  Can you then blame Westerners for fearing this religion and its believers when they aren’t at liberty to criticize it in their own societies for the very real fear of being butchered and having a large target painted on their backs?  See, there is considerable value for reinterpretation of the Quran and the hadiths and Islamic jurisprudence in a fashion that is moderate and humane and compatible with let’s just say… basic decency. So no stoning and killing gays and adulterers and apostates.  In fact that is the ONLY hope not only for the faith but for the rest of humanity - that Islam will undergo a reformation.  But for the time being, what is of considerably more relevance is how Muslims over the world feel now.  And that is not very comforting at all.  Large majorities in some of the largest Muslim nations by population like Pakistan supporting the death of blasphemers in poll after poll, is simply horrific.  Because there are twice as many Muslims in that one country alone than in all of the West put together! So the numbers matter - a lot.  80% of Pakistani Muslims (some of the most fanatical) is not equal to 80% of Albanian Muslims (some of the most moderate).  So yes, once again for the purposes of simple common sense and consequences - it is of little comfort to the victims of fundamentalist Islam including Muslims themselves (and yes, demanding the death of blasphemers is batshit crazy violent)…  What the book says.  When your head is being cut off in Saudi or you are being stoned or beaten to death for real in Afghanistan that question would be purely academic and the last thing on your mind.",5년 전,1,

Logically there is no such world and one can imagine such world to be empty space what we call as peace or ultimate peace (Moksha). I don't follow any religion and only thrive for this and try my best not to spread hate or harm any person that can harm his temporary peace because if I do that, I might have to suffer the same consequences (karma).  Any physical or mental thing that stops you from living a life you desire is harmful to the world, I haven't read that holy book Quran but I know that something is wrong with it. It binds you to follow restrictions if required then by force. I don't hate on any religion but it's a personal opinion that something is wrong with that thing. I might be wrong but this is what I realised.

GOD does not love the aggressors.” And those who refrain in war, are forgiven for: [2:192] “If they refrain, then GOD is Forgiver, Most Merciful.”  [2:193] “You may also fight them to eliminate oppression, and to worship GOD freely. If they refrain, you shall not aggress; aggression is permitted only against the aggressors.”  And also, Muslims are prohibited to force their beliefs and teachings upon any other non-Muslim  [2/ 256] “There is no compulsion where the religion is concerned.”  Muslims are also taught to do good to everyone.   [2:195] “And spend of your substance in the cause of Allah, and make not your own hands contribute to (your) destruction; but do good; for Allah loveth those who do good.” – Al Baqara  The verse doesn't specify to do good upon other Muslims only, it asks Muslims to do good to everybody, not regarding religion or background.",5년 전,0,

Then what is the recompense for those who do that among you except disgrace in worldly life; and on the Day of Resurrection they will be sent back to the severest of punishment. And Allah is not unaware of what you do."" (2:85)  ""Many of the People of the Scripture wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed, out of envy from themselves [even] after the truth has become clear to them. So pardon and overlook until Allah delivers His command. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent."" (2:109)  ""The example of those who disbelieve is like that of one who shouts at what hears nothing but calls and cries cattle or sheep - deaf, dumb and blind, so they do not understand."" (2:171)  ""O People of the Scripture, why do you confuse the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know [it]?"" (3:71)  ""...But whoever disbelieves - then indeed, Allah is free from need of the worlds."" (3:97)  ""They wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike...""

(5:41)  ""...But those who disbelieve invent falsehood about Allah, and most of them do not reason"" (5:103)  ""They want to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah refuses except to perfect His light, although the disbelievers dislike it."" (9:32)  ""Indeed, those who disbelieve spend their wealth to avert [people] from the way of Allah . So they will spend it; then it will be for them a [source of] regret; then they will be overcome..."" (8:36)  ""So the eminent among those who disbelieved from his people said, "" We do not see you but as a man like ourselves, and we do not see you followed except by those who are the lowest of us [and] at first suggestion. And we do not see in you over us any merit; rather, we think you are liars.""

He went to Aleppo and lived in the court of Saif al-Dawla al-Hamdani for a while. Then he went to Damascus and lived there until his death at the age of 80 years and was buried in Damascus.  Al-Farabi was named the ""second teacher"" in relation to the first teacher Aristotle and the launch because of his interest in logic because Al-Farabi is the explanation of Aristotle's logical works  He was a mathematician and physicist and also had interests in pharmacy, encyclopedic writing, astronomy, and history. He studied mathematics at the hands of the scientist Mansur bin Iraq (970-1036), Asir Ibn Sina (980-1037) and Ibn Maskoui (932-1030) philosophers from the city of Al-Rai located in Tehran Province. He learned Greek and Sanskrit during his travels and wrote in Arabic and Persian. Al-Biruni in the language of Khwarizm means strange or coming from outside the town, Al-Biruni wrote many books on scientific, historical and astronomical issues and has contributions in calculating triangles, circle, longitude and latitude, the rotation of the earth and the difference between the speed of light and the speed of sound, in addition to what he wrote in the history of India [24] ]. He was also famous for his books on pharmacy and medicines, where he wrote late in his life a book called ""Pharmacy in Medicine"" and the book was on the essence of drugs and their names A prominent picture of the culture of the Abbasid era, which includes many parties, as it contained natural knowledge and jurisprudential issues, and he spoke in the politics of nations, as he spoke about other religious sects and spoke about many geographical issues and the characteristics of many countries and the impact of the environment on animals, people and trees. He spoke on medicine as well as diseases in animals and in humans He mentioned many medical, plant, animal, and mineral vocabulary, as he mentioned selected verses from rare Arabic poetry in addition to other proverbs and funny anecdotes. The Arabs had known navigational and astronomical machines to determine latitude, relying on this for their accurate knowledge of the locations of the stars. Among these machines were ""perfection"" and ""ballistic"" and ""plate"" and the last one that stunned ""Vasco da Gama"" when he saw it with Ahmed bin Majid ""a rose Wind »It is a machine of wood that divides the horizon circle into the original four sides.

Later geographers mention that they saw the news of time with more than thirty parts, but it was lost and only one part of it was found and perhaps This part is attributed to Al-Masoudi because his method differs from that of Al-Masoudi (Book of Wonders and Strange Things), or that Al-Masoudi distributed the material of this book in the folds of his other books.

It is one of the most important bibliographic works, this encyclopedia has monitored nearly eighteen thousand titles of heritage books.  His four books are: His huge bibliographical dictionary, which he developed in the Arabic language and which surrounds all branches of science and literature, then his basic travel in general geography in the Turkish language, and finally two works in the Turkish language that have a more specialized nature, one of which is a modified form of a European atlas of the near era and the other is a historical workbook Closely related to navigation geography Al-Biruni is considered one of the greatest scholars known in the medieval Islamic era, his knowledge included physics, mathematics and natural sciences, and he had a prominent position as a historian, linguist and chronology scientist. [8] Al Biruni studied almost all fields of science, and his research and hard work were rewarded. [9] His royal court and powerful members of society sought him to urge him to conduct scientific research, study, and uncover some matters. Al-Biruni lived during the golden age of Islam, where scientific research took place alongside the methodology and thinking of Islamic religion. In addition to this type of influence, al-Biruni was also influenced by other nations, such as the Greeks, from whom he was inspired by his studies of philosophy.

Al-Biruni spent most of his time in Ghazni, which became the capital of Ghaznoyan, and is currently located in the eastern center of Afghanistan. Al-Biruni traveled to South Asia and wrote a study on Indian culture, ""Achieving the Acceptable or Sentiment of India by India"" after exploring Hinduism practiced in India.

You make it seem like people need to be careful not to offend you but i doubt you even are aware of the times Christians themselves might offend others. Like with that hotdog, or a hamburger. No Christian ANYWHERE in America has ever stopped themselves from eating a burger at a ball game for fear it might offend a nearby Hindu. Im not saying people should stop eating certain foods in public, but at the same time notice how many times a Hindu or Muslim has asked you to not eat certain foods in front of them? That's right.

We then saw many videos of the many good things the sihk community has done for the city of Houston and i was very amazed and moved by how good these people are. Our whole city mourned his death and learned so much about a new religion. His family received alot of help as everyone knew him as a great man .

Ya we have our issues but in general we are not selfish hateful or narcissistic. Why any of you would want to criticize a country that helps so many people and has so many great people in it, of all types of diverse cultures and races is beyond me. You sit there and say we think we are brainwashed and raised to think we're special. At the same time petting your country self on the back for how much better your country is. Who's the one that thinks they're special and so much better. I love my country and I think my country is awesome but I don't think other countries are crappier. There are so countries that need help and are in a place that may not be very good. But there's others just like us and quite possibly set up better than ours.  good for you. But America's pretty awesome and is full of amazing great people. More good than bad. So why not come over here and get a better look at what America really is and not what you read off the internet or what some comedian says. And don't get me wrong I thought this was pretty funny .  the Sikhs people are a great group of people and extremely intelligent. For 1 a lot of them have moved to America. So what does that say about America. Lol it's a funny thing about this. I go and other things but I'm not I'm just going to leave it the way it is because I'm not trying to hate on nobody. I'm just trying to stick up for my country because of the crap that I'm reading from people in other country are saying and what they're saying is wrong.

@tobeannounced2025," @continuouslylearning6152  ""Islam"" hates us? No, dumbass. Many of its adherents, particularly its fundamentalists, hate us. Wonder why? Maybe it's because we've been bankrolling Israel since its formation, no matter how many laws they break. Or maybe it's because the only time we show an interest over there is because of oil. Especially stationing US troops on what they consider their holy land. Or maybe, in the case of Iran, they hate us because we supported the overthrow of a democratically-elected regime and helped install the Shah, a major scumbag. Then we let him come here for surgery to avoid being held accountable for his reign of terror. More? Ok. Recently, that orange stain in the WH backed out of a deal which his predecessor had agreed to. The deal, btw, was meant to slowly transition Iran back into the civilized world. Maybe, just MAYBE, if we hadn't been so motivated by greed, favoritism, and Dump's small hands, ""Islam"" wouldn't hate us. If nothing else, the USSR would've collapsed 15 years earlier than it did. Our support of Israel in the late 60s and early 70s gave the world the Middle-East led oil embargoes, which suddenly gave the USSR a market for their oil.

Actually most of his marriage, if not all, are not because of his lust. He only care for one person and one person only, his first wife. Even then, he married her because she is the one asking.  Muhammad has been portrayed as someone with little lust and desire, because as a messenger, he spent most of his time guiding his followers and enemies alike to actually care about anything else.  He never fuck any goat, never rape anyone, and one wife he had who is a child, he only did her after he grows up.

They mostly can be classified to the Mongoloid race. There were no demographic changes. I am not saying that it was all peaceful. As I said, no one was as idealistic as we make them out to be, nonetheless, you exaggerate your belief that centuries of tradition can be based on constant bitter feelings, and war induced instability.

He sacrificed his not one, but 4 sons, 2 elder killed in war and 2 younger merely age of 7 years and 9 years were encased alive in masonry walls by cruel mughal king Wazir Khan. So Khalsa Panth succeded by sikhism was clearly not established for forming a Kingdom. The first known Sikh King of history Maharaja Ranjit Singh formed Sikh empire came almost 1 century after that.

An E-4 with 2 to 3 years experience will only make about 30k a year, oil field worker With 2 to 5 years experience will make about 50 to 70 thousand a year, depending on how good they are!

This is always a very good question though because even alot of Muslims believe she was 9 and I mean quite a bit of them including some scholars. But in Islam it is allowed to marry someone once they reach the age of puberty just like the rest of the world believed uo until about 60 to 70 years ago wait no it's around 80 now I believe including america which still to this day it is lawfup to marry a 13 year old or older with their parents or guardians permission. If you look at almost every single culture in history you will see that it was socialy executable to marry young teens, nowadays that's weird and taboo but not to nearly the entire human race throughout history.

@quackquack7595," @adad-ec6ht  idc. It doesn't change the objective i'm trying to make. Listen, i see you hurt a lot by something. But you have to understand the fact that if origin of whiteness is considered the Caucasus most likely and area close to both Georgia and North Caucasus (south of Russia) there are more Muslims there than Christians or Jews or another religion. I'm talking for North Caucasus from now on. Most of these ppl kicked out of their homes just because they were Muslim and still they're under serious pressure. Russia makes a lot of pressure on them. Sure, they have their autonomous regions of their own but it doesn't change the fact Russia's pressure on them. These people are the original whites so to say which for me the color is totally senseless. Because people come in all shapes and sizes. To examplize, there are over 5 million registered Circassian refugees (from Ottoman times but they became Turkish citizen after the foundation of Republic of Turkey) just in Turkey and imagine there are more across the globe. And these are just Circassians. There are much more ppl who have different identities. Like Ahıska Turks, Karadag ppl etc. They are scattered all over the world.  So, try to enhance your understanding of the world and its people. Try to get out of the shapes and sizes. We are people of the same world. And tyrants are cruel no matter of their colors.

@monolithdude8239," @17Jerod  Firstful, i'm a Muslim and secondly, I said the majority of ""Religious muslims"" not the ""majority of muslims"" as there's a slight difference here. You see, Islam unlike christianity, most of its of followers are strictly committed to the religions teaching because it orders them to. Either that or you're a not a Muslim, for instance if someone stops doing the 5 daily prayers then according to the hadith; ""Jabir reported: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “Verily, between a man and idolatry and unbelief is abandoning the prayer.” Source: Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 82 Grade: Sahih (authentic) according to Muslim"" So being religious comes naturally most of the time to many people and that's obviously leads people to follow the sunnah and then.. you guessed it, have a long beard, wear a jelbab(sometimes a short one like the afghani one is preferred because it's mentioned in a hadeeth) and similar things that strikes the same resemblance.",5년 전,1,

@jakeon-s8904," @17Jerod  Not quite the same thing.  Muslims generally come from the same area of the world (the lower portion of asia+the upper coastal area of africa)  The reason being that not many people from outside religions choose to convert.  So the vast majority of the muslim population is made up of middle eastern people, and some african americans.  about 92% of muslims come from India, the Middle-East, and Africa and have dark skin, Another 5% from Europe, and only 3% from America.  Christianity is a pretty even mix.  41% of asians are christian, 76% of white people are christian, 93% of hispanic peoples are christian, and 78% of Blacks are Christian.  And there is good reason to be a bit scared of muslims.  In the quran it states that muslims ought to kill or convert members of other religions.  As a Muslim, these people are obligated to carry out this task.  And if they don't, are they really muslim.  I was taught in a catholic school and I was always taught that to be a true catholic, one must follow all of it's beliefs.  I believe it's the same with the muslim faith.  Either carry out it'd beliefs (in which case you shouldn't be allowed into this country), or become something similar that doesn't hold this belief.  If someone openly declared in front of you that they had to kill you unless you changed your entire life to what is possibly the most unappealing religion in existence wouldn't you want them to leave?",5년 전,0,

@dineshdevjibishnoi," @ummumaryam7283  Muslims consider Mohammed as an ideal man and think that he is worth being followed. Muhammad did exactly what ISIS is doing now. Infact he's first terrorist the world has ever produced. I'm just stating facts. मैंने कोई गाली नहीं दी है भैया। Let’s take a look first what ISIS is doing. If we can agree what these ""atrocities"" are, then we can look further and  dig deeper whether we can fmd something similar in Islamic scripture and history.   So, here’s what ISIS does:   THROWING DOWN HOMOSEXUALS FROM ROOFS AND STONING THEM AFTERWARDS   Scriptural base:   Qur'an 4:16  If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and amend, Leave them alone; for Allah is Oft-returning, Most  Merciful.   Sunan Abu Dawud 38:4447  Narated By Abdullah ibn Abbas : The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: If you fund anyone doing as Lot's people did, kill the one who does it, and the one to whom it is done.   What Muhammad and companions did: Mishkat, vol. 1, p. 765, Prescribed Punishments   Ibn Abbas and Abu Huraira reported God's messenger as saying, 'Accursed is he who does what Lot's people did.‘ In a version...on the authority of Ibn Abbas it says that Ali [Muhammad's cousin and son-in-Iaw] had two people ""burned"" and that Abu Bakr [Muhammad's chief companion] had a wall thrown down on them.   Modern Exegesis:   Sheikh Muhammed Salih AI-Munajjid, Islam Q&A, Fatwa No. 5177   Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq judged in accordance with this, and he wrote instructions to this effect to Khaalid, after consulting with the Sahaabah. 'Ali was the strictest of them with regard to that. Ibn al-Qasaar and our shaykh said: the Sahaabah agreed that [the person who does homosexual acts] should be killed, but they differed as to how he should be killed. Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq said that he should be thrown down from a cliff. 'Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) said that a wall should be made to collapse on him. Ibn ‘Abbaas said, they should be killed by stoning. This shows that there was consensus among them that [the person who does homosexual acts] should be killed, but they differed as to how he should be executed. This is similar to the ruling of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) concerning the person who has intercourse with a woman who is his mahram [incest], because in both cases intercourse is not permitted under any circumstances. Hence the connection was made in the hadeeth of ibn 'Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ""Whoever you find doing the deed of the people of Loot, kill them."" And it was also reported that he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ”Whoever has intercourse with a woman who is his mahram, kill him.” And according to another hadeeth with the same isnaad, ""Whoever has intercourse with an animal, kill him and kill the animal with him."" (Narrated by Ahmad, 2420; Abu Dawood, 4464; al-Tirmidhi, 1454; aloHaakim, 4/355).   Imam Sirajudeen Bakrin, Nigerian Tribune, December 30, 2011   However, there is a divergence of opinions on the methodo|ogy to be used in executing the punishment. While some scholars such as Abu bakr [the first RightiyGuided Caliph] and Ali [Muhammad's son-in-iaw and the fourth RightIy-Guided Caiiph ] were of the view that such a person should be beheaded and set on fire thereafter, Umar [the second Rightiy-Guided Caliph] and Uthman [the third RightIy-Guided Caliph] thought the wall should be fell on him. To lbn Abbas [Muhammad‘s cousin], he should be taken to the tallest building in the town, thrown upside down while some men stand on the ground waiting to meet him with stone in replication of the destruction done to the people of Lut (Lot) by Allah.   STONING OF ADULTERERS   Scriptural base & what Muhammad did:   Sahih Bukhari (6:60:79) L7: Two people guilty of illegal intercourse are brought to Muhammad, who orders them both stoned to death.   Sahih Muslim (1714192) L7} ""in case of married (persons) there is (a punishment) of one hundred lashes and then stoning (to death). And in case of unmarried persons, (the punishment) is one hundred lashes and  exile for one year""   Sahih Muslim (17:4196) r3 A married man confesses to adultery. Muhammad orders him planted in the ground and pelted with stones. According to the passage, the first several stones caused such pain that he tried to escape and had to be dragged back.   Sahih Muslim (17:4206) L7} A woman who became pregnant confesses to Muhammad that she is guilty of adultery. Muhammad allows her to have the child, then has her stoned.   The description is graphic: ”Khalid b WaIid came forward with a stone which he flung at her head and there spurted blood on the face of Khalid and so he abused her.”   lbn Ishaq (970)   ""T he adulterer must be stoned."" These words were a part of Muhammad's farewell address to his people on the occasion of his final pilgrimage to Mecca.   ASSASSINATION OF POLITICAL OPPONENTS & ""SLANDERERS 0F ISLAM""   What Muhammad did: Bukhari vol.3 book 45 ch.3 no.687 p.415.   (687) Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah: Allah's Apostle said, 'Who would kill Ka'b bin Al-Ashraf as he has harmed Allah and His Apostle? Muhammad bin Maslama (got up and) said, 'I will kill him.’ So, Muhammad bin Maslama went to Ka'b and said, 'I want a loan of one or two Wasqs of foodgrains.""' After dickering over what to hold as mortgage, they agreed that Muhammad bin Maslama would mortgage his weapons. 80 he promised him that he would come with his weapons next time.""   Source: lbn lshaq, pp. 675-76 / 995-96.   Asma was a poetess who belonged to a tribe of Medinan pagans, and whose husband was named Yazid b. Zayd. She composed a poem blaming the Medinan pagans for obeying a stranger (Muhammad) and for not taking the initiative to attack him by surprise. When the Allah-inspired prophet heard what she had said, he asked, ""Who will rid me of Marwan’s daughter?"" A member of her husband’s tribe volunteered and crept into her house that night. She had five children, and the youngest was sleeping at her breast. The assassin gently removed the child, drew his sword, and plunged   it into her, killing her in her sleep.   The following morning, the assassin defled anyone to take revenge. No one took him up on his challenge, not even her husband. In fact, Islam became powerful among his tribe. Previously, some members who had kept their conversion secret now became Muslims openly, ""because they saw the power of Islam,"" conjectures Ibn lshaq.   Al-Tabari vo|.9 p.167:   Al-Aswad was assassinated because he claimed that he was a prophet, after coming out of the Khubban cave. He was killed a day ortwo before Mohammed's   death. AI-Tabari vo|.9 p.121   ""The Messenger of God called me and said, 'It has reached me that Khalid b. Sufyan b. Nubayh aI-Hudhali is gathering a force to attack me. He is either in Nakhlah   or 'Uranah, so go to him and kill him. Abu Dawud vo|.1 no.1244 p.328   ""He (the prophet) said, :Go and kill him. I saw him when the time of the afternoon prayer had come. I said : I am afraid if a fight takes place between me and him (Khalid b. Sufyan), that might delay the prayer. I proceeded walking towards him while I was praying by making a sign. When I reached near him, he said to me : Who are you? I replied : A man from the Arabs ; it came to me that you were gathering (any[sp] army) for this man (i.e. the Prophet). Hence I came to you in connection with this matter. lthen walked along with him for a while; when it became convenient for me, I dominated him with my sword until he became cold (dead).""   AI-Tabari vo|.8 p.122   According to Ibn Ishaq: Kinanah b. aI-Rabi' b. Abi aI~ Huqayq who had the treasure of the Banu aI-Nadir, was brought to the Messenger of God, who questioned him, but he denied knowing where it [the treasure] was. Then the Messenger of God was brought a Jew who said to him, ""I have seen Kinanah walk around this ruin every morning."" The Messenger of God said to Kinanah: ""What do you say? If we find it in your possession, I will kiII you. ""All right he answered. and commanded that the ruin should be dug up, and some of the treasure was extracted from it. Then he asked  him for the rest of it. Kinanah refused to surrender it, so the Messenger of God gave orders concerning him to al-Zubayr b. al-‘Awwam, saying, ""Torture him until you root out what he has."" Al-Zubayr kept twirling his firestick in his breast until Kinanah almost expired [died]; then the Messenger of God gave him to Muhammad b. Maslamah, who beheaded him to avenge his brother Mahmud b. Maslamah.""   The list goes on.",5년 전,2,

I doubt you'd like it if someone came up to you and said ""science is fake, kill yourself for believing in it."" In saying the shit you have, you've become the very thing you hate. It's true that religion has a history of violence, but that's part of human nature. The beauty of humanity is the ability to adapt to changing times and improve ourselves and our communities. Most major religions don't practice the murder-everyone-who-doesn't-believe-in-our-faith teachings anymore. We have freedom of religion, people are free to practice their religions (so long as it doesn't impede the rights of others, *looks at evangelicals who are glaring at LGBT*) here. Respect it.",5년 전,0,
@AzazelSylphson,"MG Butler Pretty sure you only read the first few sentences of my comment, so I’ll say it again here, AS LONG AS YOUR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY DOESN’T INTERFERE WITH OTHER PEOPLE’S LIBERTIES, THERE’S NO HARM IN IT. first off, I’m pretty sure I’m atheist. I have trouble believing there’s a life after death. Second, I acknowledge the problems religion has had on the past, hence why I mentioned “it’s no longer legal to kill someone because they’re a non believer.” You must be a special breed of asshole to sit there and insult people because of what they believe in. Again, as long as their beliefs don’t interfere with anyone’s liberties (lgbt discrimination, etc) there’s no harm in it. And that’s part of generational changes. We question the old rules and decide to just not follow them. Just listen to Pope Francis. Many religions have their problems, to be sure, but we’ve come a long way, and ignoring that because you hate religion is simply ignorant. So maybe respect other people’s beliefs. As long as it doesn’t prevent you from eating at McDonald’s, it’s harmless. Also, go get laid or jack it. You seem really pent up.",5년 전,0,
@AzazelSylphson," @goingwiththecurrent  That is NOT what I said. I said there was a generational shift, and the ways people used to practice their religion (i.e. killing non believers who refused to convert, stoning women who wanted divorces, killing gays, etc.) are unacceptable now. You're so absorbed by your own hatred of religion that you refuse to acknowledge the change it's going through right now. True, religion has a history of violence, that much is indefensible. But people change, and so too does religion. It wasn't that long ago when businesses could refuse service to you if you were gay. Nowadays, that's illegal and can get companies and businesses in trouble if they discriminate like that. (Well, in Obama's presidency, anyway, Trump's is uncertain.) You sit there, unflinching in your resolve to belittle religion, despite the good people that exist in it. I'll let you in on a little secret. Not all people in religion agree with 100% of their teachings. Most people pick what to believe in, what seems most humane to them. Again, if your religious liberty includes discriminating against others, it has no place in the modern world, and I will DESTROY that religious liberty you so desperately cling to. But if not, you are free to practice as much as you want. There's no harm in believing a magic man floating in the sky will reunite you with your loved ones after you die. Personally, I would love nothing more than to be with my late mother after I die, but that's neither here nor there. The point is, religion is going through legitimate change right now. Maybe not as fast as I would like, but it's happening. Ignoring that is the very definition of ignorance. So quit being such a pissant and get some fucking compassion. Seriously though, go hire a prostitute or something. God knows you need pop your cherry. edit also, thanks for pointing out I have a basic understanding of empathy. Really nice to see obvious empathy being applied to people being shit talked.",5년 전(수정됨),3,
@AzazelSylphson,"MG Butler it would seem you’re not listening to the point I’m trying to make. I’m not saying they’ve changed, I’m saying they’re CHANGING, as in currently undergoing a generational shift. Yes, things aren’t changing as fast as I want them to, but it is happening, and not acknowledging that is a prime example of ignorance. And the Bible was written by man 2000+ years ago, during far more uncivilized times. No, the Bible is not purely god’s word, which is why it’s full of contradictions. It’s also been rewritten several times in the past. The parts people find inhuman are being ignored, not by everyone, but by most. If you’d get over your own hatred, you’d find most religious people are mostly decent people at heart. But you’re so consumed by your own hatred that you don’t even see the hypocrisy in your statements. So go fuck yourself, you micropenised shit guzzler.",5년 전,1,

No religion allow to create sects, no religion allows to hate others. If somebody  hate others, then he is sick and he should be responsible not his religion. Neither one should consider religions against humanity just because psychopaths fought in the name of this. I won't say the school bad just because some of the students don't follow the syllabus.

@nayankalitadualcitizen," @goingwiththecurrent  nope, the Sikh headgear has a tangible purpose. You see when the Sikh faith was in its infancy, the Mughals were ruling most of India, and most of them were intolerant pricks, who picked on all other religions. Sikh religious doctrine incorporates respect for other faiths and followers consider it their duty to stand up to religious persecution. Since the Mughals killed entire villages whenever one of their soldiers or officers got beaten up by these dudes, one Sikh guru made it a point of honour that instead of entire communities, the Sikhs would take the burden upon themselves. Sikh religious doctrine also stresses on bravery so Sikhs are expected to defend their faith as well as other faiths when requested or when circumstances demand it. So the Sikh Gurus made a rule for Sikhs to wear 5 symbols of Sikhism. One of them is the turban, which makes it impossible for a Sikh to deny his religion in the face of persecution to protect others who might become collateral damage otherwise. It's ironic that the religion of the Mughals was Islam, and now the Sikhs have to defend them.",5년 전,1,

I respect people's religious beliefs but I definitely think religion will be less and less important as we realize that even if there is a god, he probably doesn't care about us we have to be our own gods.

No other religion gives as much equality to everyone as Sikhism does...and the turban has a huge importance.

But hey, just for shits 'n' giggles, since I've already dignified your deep self-denial with a response, I'll add that your asinine assertion that ""blah blah above the poverty line blah blah evil"" doesn't even remotely apply to me the way you're supposing it must and are thus attempting to not-so-subtly suggest I should humbly reflect on, as if that would somehow absolve you anyway, and idk, probably also elicit the compassion you so desperately need in order to validate this fucking narrative you're clinging to in order to cope with the horrendous decisions you once made -- not merely because I'm entirely below this arbitrary line you've drawn as a metric for characterizing how much one's means of generating income (which isn't even an indication of survival need) ""supports evil"" or not, but also because I actually value this principle you have such a hard-on for but can't seem to carry out, so much so that I have never sacrificed it even for the sake of my living standards.

Not just recognized by international but united nation itself. And you know it very well I’m not making this out of nowhere. Third, you said it wrong there was not violated in past as much as today in India. At the time of Sikh pm monmahan sing indin minorities were way happier then today. Most importantly, just coz you did not see any violence towards Muslims in front of your eyes does not mean this is not happening or did not exists. Either you too blind or acting upon it as if nothing happened. Sorry dude just because you did not see nor was there when hitler killed Jews, does not mean it did not take place or happened. Just because you close  the book, does not mean chapter ends no chapter as well as history still there it’s just you don’t want to read that’s it.  Moreover, you might not forget about tabraz ansari it did not happen on past but recently. Not just that after him  many guys have been faced and killed just like same as him, and that was not on news but they themselves recorded it while doing so. So how can you say violence is not happening in India, even Muslims actors are facing that too whoever speak on Kashmir issues are been banned or jail, i.g azaj khan.Famous tik tok actors team 07 accounts was banned for speaking for those innocent Muslims so how can you say this is no more or how will you stand by your words. Ali Goni another famous Muslims actor from JK had hard time to find apartment coz he’s from jk, because of that no one wanted to give him rent( Muslims and from jk) big issues my friend, and he himself shared this on his social media so how do I believe your so called secular nation is not doing any wrong to Muslims when everything is there and clear. I know as an Indian it hurts you but I’m sorry that’s the fact your country become worse day by day under bjp government. Last but not least, you said India belong to Muslims as much as it belong to Hindus ok good I respect your statement but wrong so so wrong again; when bjp leaders like yogi himself said we already give Pakistan to Muslims there is nothing we can do to Muslims anymore now it times for Hindus. He further said anyone Muslim has problems can go to Pakistan. Wow I’m shocked now you tell me how do I believe on you who is nothing but a normal public like me. When your political powers giving you ppl rights to do anything to Muslims then what better can I expect from anyone you tell me and what you Indin expect from me towards you. I’m sorry I don’t like to disrespect Hindus or India but what do I do you guys left me with nothing to lose. I know after reading this bounce of Indian Hindus will attack me or even called me terrorist belong to Pakistan and all but it’s ok I’m used to it.

Look at other Arab nation like UAE for example Hindus and other minorities are sooo well respected no one says anything to them. If in India there is peace then India wouldn’t be 3rd worse nation in nationwide isn’t it. Golden Sikh temple and babri masjid wouldn’t be demolished when first your own sup-court ordered that there would masjid and mandir then how come now they give full land to you.

@madhurilikhitkar9518," @rifat_0977  My friend I believe that (I might be wrong) that India is one of the most diverse countries in the world. At the time of India's independence many world leaders made fun of India saying it would not last even ten years and split up into multiple states based on religion or linguism.    But as we see it did not happen. We Indians can be compared to a very big family where there are many members living under one roof. There are bound to be some differences between different individual and occasionally conflicts too might happen but there also exists a bond between the family which eventually keeps them united and makes them respect each other's existence and forgive each other.    And as for being 3rd in religious violence, isn't it obvious that as the number of family members increases so will the number of conflicts? But I believe what is more noteworthy that we are still together as one big joint family instead of many dispersed nuclear families and live besides each other to this day which makes me feel proud to be a part of a nation like India.",5년 전,1,
@rifat_0977,"BRICK SHAW lol thanks for answering half of your own scenes less statement. First, as you said babri masjid is disputed land which I completely agree then tell me one thing how could your Supreme Court give this land over Hindus when it’s disputed. First, your so called justice court ordered that it will be divided into 3 parts one fir Muslims one for Hindus and one for something  else then recently it’s given to Hindus so that says I’m living in that dream world where hypocrisy is even in the justice. I’m living in that dream world where after 70 years of independent Muslims are been asked to provide identity to prove they belongs to this country. I’m living in that world where after 70 years of independent Muslims are been asked to go Pakistan coz it made for them. I’m living in that world where after 70 years of independent Muslims are been asked to prove patriots by saying “barat maa ki jai” after 70 years of independent Muslims are been forced to say jai sree ram and then faced to death this is the dream world I’m living. I’m living in that dream world where Muslims women are being humiliated, abused, cursed coz they chooses not to uncover their dignity, respect for faith and most importantly self respect after 70 years of independent. English left but they leave some of their dogs in the name of bjp and their voters. I’m living in that world where after 70 years of independent city name are being changed coz it’s named by Muslim rulers and its goes on n on hope I’ve covered enough. And mind it India is India it’s all of us Muslims we made India. Before Muslims rulers came what did India had?? Yes you had but everything was so mess. None of your maharaja subis were United it’s we who made India united. If India is known as missile power it’s Muslim dr apj who developed your India’s missile. 20% of Indian economic profits came from Taj Mehal itself and who made it?? And the conversation goes on and on so be thankful to us. And yes Islam was not introduced by babar in India have some research use your fucking tiny brain before saying anything. I would love to conclude myself by giving you some advice which are; think wisely read carefully and walk with dignity period.",5년 전,0,
@dasamlan9874," @rifat_0977  so if its a disputed land, giving it to muslims will show that justice is being delivered. Lol hypocrisy at its peak. Name changing of places is the worst thing this govt has done. If muslims came to india to ""develop"" it then why there are thousands of vandalised temples left by ur muslims rulers. U cant admit but they came with the sole purpose of spreading islam, the so called religion of peace, in the indian subcontinent. With the idea of ghazwa-e-hind. Lol who would trust these people when they can turn against u anytime. Before muslim rulers came, there was peace, we weren't fighting in the name of religion. Then muslims came, in 12th century. 500000 hindus were killed just like that who opposed conversion, and u talk about development?? Buddhist universities, shrines, statues were demolished, mosques built on them. Buddhism was made to flee from their own home. But hindus continue to suffer for next 3-4 centuries. Ever heard of nalanda???  Nice way of spreading peace😆😆😆. U guys have a different mindset of peace. U say APJ Abdul Kalam. How many muslims after that have made a significant impact on the society. The lynching incident u hear about is not the whole story but u believe it anyway coz ""a muslim is beaten by hindu"". What else do we need to verify it!!!. But what u dont know is that the muslims student was beaten by a mob consisting of 2 hindus and 5 muslims. Recently a muslim man was thrashed by 6 muslims. But media reported, ""a muslim youth thrashed by fellow students in bihar"". And u say hindus are killing muslims??? Ok let's say they ARE killing. How many have u heard??? Not like blowing an entire hotel, or school, or flying a plane into the hotel. There are some radicals among hindus. And by some, i mean 2-3%.  I am no supporter of BJP if that's what u think. Fuck these people playing religion card in politics.",5년 전(수정됨),0,
@rifat_0977,"BRICK SHAW lol I was surprised by your level of talking. Buddy plz eat some nuts and milk which will benefits you to remember your own statement. It’s you who said it was disputed not me. So thanks again for answering your own question. Most importantly, it was not yet proven that it was a temple before. Yes by the order of Supreme Court they investigated the whole place where they found a something huge but it’s not clear neither proven that it’s part or belongs to temple. So he’s hypocrisy above all. And regarding Muslims destroying Hindu temples which temple are you even talking about?? Lol you can say anything you want it’s really does not matter for me. If Muslims forcefully converted Hindus then India would have been Muslim majority land. We have been ruled your country for decades and yet India is hindu dominant nation so that says enough who’s what. Isn’t it so funny your Bollywood movie industry and actors are also speeding hindu propaganda and you still depending your words lol slow claps what a joke. Since April 2018 to November 32 Muslim guy have killed just for having beef and it’s only 7 months I did not even include recent one so you better don’t even talk. You you trynna fool?? Don’t play with your words we are not blind. If there is so called peace and 4,5% violence then your nation would not marked by united nation as worse country in terms of religion violence and minority groups in first place. I don’t know that 4, 5%  will make huge impact on your country that united nation marked and see it as worse  and not would be 3rd place globally, also your City name would not change buddy in 21st century. If 5% is this then you left me with nothing I don’t know what percentage is 5 that leads your nation in that place.So stop your bullshit and regarding golden temple it was destroyed in 84 by your Hindu extremists not my Muslims. You guys are so limited in I me and myself that’s it you no wanna see anything else outside of it.",5년 전,0,
@dasamlan9874," @rifat_0977  keep living in denial about the presence of ram temple. KK muhammed of ASI proved that there was a temple becoz there are still pillars, present there buried in the earth. So according to u, a disputed land would become pure if muslims will get it. 1st time the issue of babri masjid was raised by a group who wanted the temple to be built. They wrote jai shree ram on the masjid wall. Lol go and read some history and then spew some non sense as to how islam was spread in india. U have a different concept of development and peace which is too degrading to my small mind. 😆😆😆 Both hindus and muslims are subject to persecution when comes to religious violence. So dont play the victim card now. Sikhs always stood with hindus. The golden temple incident was politically motivated during congress rule. The restoration work was done by both hindus and sikhs. U think all hindus were converted to islam. Lol there were many hindus and sikhs who opposed, fought for their right. Sikhs always fought alongside hindus in every war against invaders. Pakistani human rights activists are  shouting against the atrocities done by their govt and army but the world is silent. Even UN knows nothing can be expected from a terrorist country like pakistan.But only some people killed in religious violence, and the world cries for india. We have been seeing this for a long time, educate urself. With 201 million muslims, india has the largest muslim minority population. And u talk about 32 deaths??? But not the thousands of deaths of hindus, sikhs, buddhists in their own land. Lol talk about double standards. If muslims are being killed in india then there wouldn't have been muslim presidents, leaders in different institutions, muslims players in cricket team, even captains, soldiers in army, in the past 70 years. Muslims in india are educated, have their rights. U talk about babri masjid like its the only masjid in india. There are approximately 300000 mosques in india alone, jama masjid being the largest. No mosques, or church are taxed. They are standing and active. How many have been vandalised??? None. There was a recent bomb blast in a mosque where the imam and its followers were arrested for planting religious disharmony. Ur own people are destroying mosques in order to show religious intolerance and u say hindus are killing muslims. How many non muslims have u seen in a muslim majority country in important positions, such as MPs, or prime ministers. Pakistan paseed a law that no non muslims can become leader of any govt institution. And imran khan is crying for islam in UN. A month ago or so, a 70 year old ahmadi mosque was vandalised by pak police becoz they are not recognised as muslims in their own home. 🤣Double standards everywhere. 😪😪.Better do a thorough homework on how indian muslims are performing in the world stage, making india proud, they are well educated. Not living in delusion like bangladeshi and pakistani muslims. How many indian muslims have u heard blowing themselves up or doing jihad.

@rifat_0977,"BRICK SHAW wow look how frustrated you are lmao I so fucking loved it. Point 1, out of frustration you don’t even know what are you saying  😂 dummy it was not me who said the land where babri masjid built is disputed land it was you who said so go back to your comment and read. I said when court decided  it will be part into 3 one for Muslims one for Hindus and one for something else then how come now the full land given to Hindus?? So it’s you who said it is belongs to Hindus despite the fact that it’s disputed. So yea dabble standers hypocrisy is spreed all over rape public of India and you which is proven by your own comments there you go thanks to you. Point 2, it is yet not proven that the pillars acutely belongs to temple and I’m going prove it now. The HuffPost by beetwa Sharma updated 10/11/2019 that There Is No Evidence Of A Temple Under The Babri Masjid, Just Older Mosques, Says Archeologist. The archeologists, who were observers during the excavation on behalf of the Sunni Waqf Board, a party to the tile suit in the Ayodhya dispute, say the ASI, then under the Bharatiya Janata Party-led (BJP-led) National Democratic Alliance government, was under pressure to reinforce the Hindu right-wing narrative that Mughal emperor Babur's general Mir Baqi knocked down a temple to build a mosque on the spot where Hindu god Ram was born.  Ahead of the 26th anniversary of the Babri Masjid's demolition, Varma spoke to HuffPost India about the three key pieces of evidence found in 2003, why she thinks the ASI felt compelled to fabricate its conclusion, and procedural lapses during the excavation led by B.R. Mani, who was later replaced on an order by the Allahabad High Court. In 2016, the Modi government appointed Mani as the Director General of the National Museum. There are three things. What the ASI has excavated is not evidence there was a temple underneath the mosque. One is this western wall, the second are these 50 pillar bases and third are architectural fragments. The western wall is a feature of a mosque. It is a wall in front of which you say namaaz. It is not the feature of a temple. Temple has a very different plan. Underneath the Babri Masjid, there are actually older mosques. Now, as far as these pillar bases are concerned, these are completely fabricated and they filed many complaints to the court about it. There argument is that if you look at what they are claiming to be pillar bases, these are pieces of broken bricks and they have mud inside them. There is no way a pillar can even stand on it, it is so unstable. It's a completely political issue. They wanted that report to say there are pillar bases and it said there are pillar bases. Moreover, the photograph that ASI said is temple pillars is also proven wrong.The photographs are what they call pillar bases, which are pieces of bricks put together in a half-squarish, half rectangular, half circular forms. There are three pillar bases that he marks out in that photograph.",5년 전,0,
@rifat_0977,"BRICK SHAW 2nd part also you are totally fucked up read carefully what I said. I only mentioned about 7 months which was April 2017 to November 2017 I clearly stated that and if you problem with understanding then I’m sorry there is no other way that I can explain. And it only coz of cow and I did not even mention from time to time so you better read and understand. You ppl have issues with every single thing with Muslims for say it shariha law, so called love for India or women with hijab, azan, praying outside of masjid which I did not even mentioned nor talk. I only and only about 2017 half of months. If I. Only 7 months 28 ppl were killed then rest of them I leave them on you think. Also, thanks again to prove myself right. You said Sikhs always stand by Hindus which true they stand by India and in returns what they get nothing but violence which leads them to protests, asking for own land kalistan. If Sikhs were happy then the sikhs movements wouldn’t exists. Also, in 84 8000-17000 Sikhs were died by your Hindu right wings terrorist group but look at the hypocrisy again government mention only 2800 and 3500 nationwide wow. So Yet gain it’s you who are dabble standers and hypocrite not me so don’t point at me. Look at your statement again which proves you wrong. First i use  apj as an example then you said he’s the only one that contributes India then there’s no one now you saying you have tons of Muslims mp, minister doctors, engineers, even army who’s fighting for his own motherland now where all these cane from??? Now you tell me who’s dabble standers you or me yes it’s you who doesn’t even know what are you trynna say. Your previous statement and recent one has no balance does support each other claim lol. It’s ok I can understand out of frustration you did not even think what are you writing. That’s why I give you advice in very first place think wisely, read carefully and walk with dignity but no you don’t want that so you choose hypocrisy which is find after it’s on your nature how would some one change its nature right. And why are even talking Pakistan I’m not from Pakistan. This is the symbol of hypocrite when he has nothing starts talking shit about others rather his own. And what imran khan is doing for its minorities if your so called secular bjp leader does one 3rd I’ll stop talking. And one more thing which was asked in your parliament by owasi that Muslims are educated even in Kashmir and all over India then why the percentage of job opportunities for Muslims are less when modi said he wants to see Muslims one hand with computers and one hand with Quran. He further said in harihaana (idk I spelled it write) if a Hindu guy give divorce he only has 1 year jail whereas Muslims 3 years for that wow so yea hypocrisy and double standards everywhere. Look at my country Bangladesh all awami leaders are Hindu so you better don’t even talk about it which is 10 times smaller by land and  by population. Bangladesh ranked number 1 in terms of gender inequality among South Asia that’s says enough who stand where. Don’t throw stones at others house when your own house made with glass.",5년 전,0,
@rifat_0977,BRICK SHAW and yes they surely making India proud but in returns they are only getting humiliation and asked to go Pakistan coz your current leaders and ppl think hindu already give land to Muslims that’s it now it’s only hindu who should be care wow what logical and secular mindset you ppl have. And  do not even talk about Islam I’m only talking about Hindus if you again talk shit then I will not keep silent I’m saying this here. You wanna take it as warning ⚠️ or funniest way that’s not my problem but yes don’t. I can see how much love respect Indian Muslims have in this comment by you and your fellow brothers lmao.,5년 전,0,
@dasamlan9874," @rifat_0977  so u admit bangladesh is ranked 1 in gender inequality!! Lmao. Ur so called khalistani propaganda is just another delusion funded by Pakistani ISI. How many sikhs have u seen, crying for khalistan. On one hand show ur support to sikhs and in another promote khalistani propaganda. Double standards hypocrites. Now 2 hours ago, 4 muslim men linked to ISIS arrested in delhi. They were planning to plant IED in a carnival in assam. They were from ur peaceful community. Now, no media will highlight the issue. U are giving example of imran khan, the man termed as ""taliban khan"" for his alleged links with taliban. He can cry for indian muslims, but is mumm for uighur community of china, ahmadi muslims, rohingya muslims etc etc. Becoz if he speaks anything against china, his 3rd father is going to cut off funding. Another double standard so called islamic leader. U forgot 1971?? And u show ur immense support for pakistan!! That's why i called u a hypocrite, a typical muslims mindset to see every muslim as friend, and every non muslim as enemy. Lol, keep living in fool's paradise. Forgot seikh hasina's speech in UN??? Then talk about imran khan and pakistan.  China is doing a great job in pakistan. Pakistan dont even know what kind of trouble awaits. Africa, sri lanka, and 3-4 other countries are already controlled by china from shadows due to chinese debt-trap. I cant comprehend, why u muslims cant stay at one place, and even if u stay as a minority why cant u follow the rules of that place.?? Always poking ur nose in others' affairs and demanding separate rights.  U talk about sharia law, like its a good thing. LGBTQ+  dont have rights, triple talaq is legal, man can marry 3-4 women, covered from head to toe. This is called equality in sharia law.  So acc to u india should give every major sector to muslims as a free no qualification, agenda and then the world will accept india as a tolerant nation. If india is such a bad state for muslims and if bangladesh is so religious tolerant then why bangladeshi muslims are entering india illegally and thousands are kicked every year. So tolerant that they cant find a stable life in their own country.  Its true, that india is not the best place for every religion but we are taking one step at a time. But keep ur people from coming illegally to india and creating havoc in every sector, increasing. We have enough problems to deal with. Muslims should earn their respect just like everyone else. U think everything's easy for hindus in india?? Lol there's special quotas, reservation in every govt exams, govt schools, for minorities. Other people are having a hard time qualifying for jobs. But are we complaining?? Everybody's struggling to get a stable life. Muslims arent special creatures. They have to struggle too. Just 3-4 lynchings by some extremists and u term whole india as religious intolerant. And plzz dont give the example of a terrorist state like pakistan and imran khan. A country where the religious munority declined from 15% to 2% and in the same 70 years religious minority in india increased from 4% to 20% Make some good jokes.",5년 전(수정됨),0,
@rifat_0977,"BRICK SHAW first you constantly proving yourself wrong by your own comments. It’s the fact that Bangladesh ranked number 1 in terms of gender equality. About kalistan I’ve not spread any propaganda no we don’t play that game it’s only you guys who does this it’s your media ur leaders not us. The truth is you are miles away from truth nor and if someone wants to tell you started playing with your words. Anyways, see kalistan protests in UK Canada USA in YouTube and you will find out I don’t have to do it. Most importantly, about Sharia law who do you even know what sharia law is?? My boy don’t fall below the ground. Yes Quran says you can marry up to 4 wives but did you read further verses I’m sure you did not. So first do your research and homework rightly then raise question on us.   Regarding your allegation that Islam and our Sharia did not do justice with women the answer is below;  The ruling on plural marriage in Islam:  The shar’i text which permits plural marriage is:   Allaah says in His Holy Book (interpretation of the meaning):   “And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one or (slaves) that your right hands possess. That is nearer to prevent you from doing injustice”  [al-Nisa’ 4:3]  It should be noted that there are conditions attached to plural marriage:    1 – Justice or fairness.   Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):   “but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one”  [al-Nisa’ 4:3]   This aayah is indicates that just treatment is a condition for plural marriage to be permitted. If a man is afraid that he will not be able to treat his wives justly if he marries more than one, then it is forbidden for him to marry more than one. What is meant by the justice that is required in order for a man to be permitted to have more than one wife is that he should treat his wives equally in terms of spending, clothing, spending the night with them and other material things that are under his control.   With regard to justice or fairness in terms of love, he is not held accountable for that, and that is not required of him because he has no control over that. This is what is meant by the verse,   “You will never be able to do perfect justice between wives even if it is your ardent desire”  [al-Nisa’ 4:129 – interpretation of the meaning].   2 – The ability to spend on one’s wives:   The evidence for this condition is the verse:   “And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste, until Allaah enriches them of His Bounty”  [al-Noor 24:33 – interpretation of the meaning]   In this verse Allaah commands those who are able to get married but cannot find the financial means, to remain chaste. One such example is not having enough money to pay the mahr (dowry) and not being able to spend on one’s wife. (al-Mufassal fi Ahkaam al-Mar’ah, part 6, p. 286).  But you ppl only quote out of context and say look Sharia allow Muslims man to marry 4 wives lol this is called hypocrisy. BDW Islam is not the only religion that allow man to have 4 wives prophet before mmuhammed upon whom be peace had more then 4 for some reasons prophet Ibrahim two , suliman had multiple wives pbut all. And also your god Krishna had 16100 wives so what about it?? You even have naked nude idols temple where vulgar idols been worship what about that have we ever raise questions on this no. Coz first, it’s strictly prohibited in Islam to attack or abusing other gods. And Allah says in Quran very clearly that do not abuse other gods that are been worship other then Allah which will leads violence, killing. Most importantly they will do the same so it’s very clear concept. This is the difference between us and no Muslims who always talk about Islam and Muslims it’s like your day can’t be complicate without it. But keep that in mind the more you attack on us we even come across stronger Alhamdulillah. Now I also can say that India is known as capital of rape it’s coz your religion tell you to do so based on worshipping naked vulgar idols which leads towards rape yes logically it’s true. Ppl are being influenced by that. Not just that, your women even do lingo puja don’t they?? So plz don’t talk nonsense which will only prove you wrong. You also know that in this debate you lost and have nothing so keep bringing religion into it which has nothing to do at first place. I talk about India hindu extremists violence not Hinduism. So this is the second time I’m telling you do not force me to open up something which will not be appropriated by you. I can talk about Hinduism and it’s justice rights and all coz I’ve studied and I have the guts to prove you wrong yes which will be nasty so plz do not talk about something which you barely have knowledge. Well, nothing better can expect from you as an Indian coz when your bjp leader yogi can say all Muslims women should be pull out from home, grave  and should be rape then you public’s are nothing. If a nation leaders are like that then think how would be it’s people. No further discussion needed. Not just that when 7 years of Kashmir girl was raped bjp supporters took out rely to support these bastard wow what a develop India slow claps 👏🏼 ppl protests against violence and rape but you guys do the opposite lol wow. Lastly, we as Bangladeshi Muslims will die out of hunger but will never go to India period. What you guys think about your country?? Your nation itself is not rich. Your poverty rate is way higher then us so don’t talk nonsense. It’s your Hindu bjp propaganda that Muslims of Bangal like Assam are illegal lol. First of all it’s so funny Assam itself is the poorest state in India and Bangladeshi will go there lol for what?? And our pm Hasina answered this question so well when she was asked by your media. I recommend you to watch it. But the truth is even opposites Indian are working here in Dhaka garments textiles factories. So plz don’t talk something you barely know. In addition to that, I’ve nothing to do with Pakistan it’s you who bought this topic not me so plz. You  are so frustrated that you don’t even know what are you talking about. 60% of your population are struggling for toilets and do you think Bangladeshi will go to toilet less nation like India lol nice jokes.",5년 전,0,

So, I would get angry in my head and think, 'if she were drowning I would not throw her a rope"" but then I knew I would...because it was not about her, it was about me and the kind of person I am. She tries to turn me into something I am not. I must stand up, and be the person I am. I don't know if this is clear, what I am trying to say.

@jasonsherwood8064,Appearance is obviously the #1 way that people will judge you. Islamic terrorism is a huge issue in and outside of the US and people are going to be fearful of you if they can associate the way you look with a belief that endangers them. Its not right that millions of innocent immigrants to the US are being judged this way but it is a natural response from a human being. If you want to live in America you need to expect that not everyone is going to feel completely comfortable around you no matter what you look like or believe. I'm white and get judged constantly for it from different cultures and I don't cry over it. Safety for the people of America is our biggest priority so if you are screened twice then be thankful that theyre doing their jobs.

@anirudhsinha2369,"People here arguing that schools need to educate kids early, is a great point. Sure. But, understand this...a huge percentage of the ""education"" really happens outside of schools...at homes. The value system in the society matters. Children learn from parents & peers (and now, the internet). If the prevailing ideology in a culture is hateful & prejudiced, that's exactly what kids pick up on. This is indoctrination. This can stop when most folks in the US become aware. Sadly, their media wants to continue to have unaware & brainwashed masses with non-autonomous thinking, so that they can blindly support their government's blatant discriminatory practices without question. They want sheep, and sheep they have become. Its all done in the name of justice, equality and freedom. It's a fallacy. Its fed in, and the sheep swallow it down without chewing.  Sadly, the world media echoes what the US media puts out. This lack of intelligence, or even intellect among the common folk in US isn't in the least bit surprising to me.   Hate breeds hate. Every nation has a right to defend itself, and take all possible preemptive actions too. Learn to draw the line between that and prejudice, USA. Every man is capable of hate, or love.

@eeshamulumoodi8580,"All religions have become messed up. The ultimate goal for all religions was to live on peace and happiness (at least that's what I assume). Unfortunately, in the ongoing generations, so many terrible incidents have occurred, creating a greater belief-gap (as I'd like to term it). This situation has gone absolutely haywire and way beyond control. As an Indian, I can confidently state that Indira Gandhi's actions were unforgivable--she was the cause of so many innocent sikh's deaths. Although I don't have much insight to this issue, I believe that sikhs are humble people who deserve the utmost respect. The same applies to all other religions.   If we time the beginning of our existence (billions of years ago), where we existed as cavemen/cave women, nothing like religion existed. It was a simple life of survival. In my perspective, religions were made as belief systems--something people could rely on during downfalls. However, that's the moment humanity/the human community began differentiating. That was when the cultural division, societal beliefs & norms and vocal feuds surfaced. The existence of religion is what wreaked havoc. The root cause of all chaos. I'm not trying to enforce atheist beliefs upon anyone because I'm a Hindu myself. My main stance is that everybody should be able to coexist peacefully and live an integrated life where people of all sorts are accepted.  I'd like to move on from the past--I'm not telling you to neglect it, but I'm suggesting that we should focus on the upcoming times. If I had the capacity to end all these issues, I unarguably would but this isn't magic. This is something that requires cooperation. The beginning steps of moving on is closure. To come in terms with what happened. Lose the aggravation; the itch that makes you so  defensive. To move on from the history. To live in the now and for the future. I kindly request all of you to end this argument. As a first step. Having such strong and polar opinions filled with so much hatred only worsens the situation.  My intention through this excessively elongated comment isn't to offend anyone but hopefully, at the very least change a few mindsets such that as time goes by, coexistence wouldn't be such a liability. Sincerely, Eesha.  (P. S. I don't know any of y'all but remember I love all of you, I give you my good luck and blessings regardless of your background. Hope your years to come are filled with joy and maybe through this message you learn the importance to promote peace rather that arguing about these things and infuriating the situation even more).",6년 전,1,

@blrh.anna.h6950, Jyoti Ranjan Sahoo   I know most Hindus are like the whites in America...They just don't like Muslims..but the sad thing about India is that different from America its a third world country and Muslims occupy a huge population so isolating them and treating them as second class citizens will do more harm than good to the already poor country....But as for Sikhs I can't say much they are a minority community living under the mercy of a Hindu supremacist government I don't blame them if they choose to hate Muslims so as to survive. Cause God knows the kind of harsh treatment anybody who shows pity to the  suffering Muslims in Kashmir gets subjected to.....I'm not Pakistani by the way😂,5년 전(수정됨),0,
@theducklord6125," @aqsaali2670  funny how a Pakistani is condemning the golden temple massacare when millions of Sikhs we're killed and displaced from their ancestral lands because a certain country could not tolerate other religions. One is a secular country while the other a theocratic. One has thousands of different ethnicities and dozens of religions while the other. yep you guessed it doesn't tolerate other religions. And guess why a certain country lost 3 wars against us? It was the very same Sikhs who took up arms against a country who persecuted millions of their loved ones, who destroyed the Pakistani army humiliating them in three separate occasions.  Yup the Golden Temple Massacare is a shame on our country's history but just like there are radical Islamists spreading terror all over the central and south East Asia there will be some radical Hindus too.  So yes the greatest atrocities committed against the Sikhs have been committed by muslims and it started long before the partition during the rule of the Mughal empire. Last but not the least, in the region  of present day Pakistan where there used to be millions of Sikhs, now no more than 20000 Sikhs are left and they were left out from the census because the Pakistani government considers them 2nd class citizens. Imagine a region where there were millions of Sikhs used to live now only has less than 20000 of them left. in a country which has a population of 200 million people. If you ask me the atrocities committed by the Pakistani Muslims against the Sikhs is comparable to the Holocaust.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@povelvieregg165,"TBH, also they don't give a shit about learning. I was shocked when in the US, about their utter lack of curiosity. When I visit other parts of the world, people tend to be more curious about other places. They ask more questions. I remember an American asking me about my studies, and it came up that I was going home to Norway afterwards.   The guy was truly shocked I was leaving the US. He was like: ""How can you leave the US? It is the best country in the world?"" So I asked him if he had ever been to Norway or knew anything about it, given that he was certain the US would be better for me. Negative. He had never been abroad and knew nothing about Norway. Curiously he had absolutely no interest in learning anything about Norway. He did not ask me a single question about what Norway was like and why I may have wanted to go back. No, instead he ranted all about how great America was. Despite the fact that I had been there for almost a year, and most certainly had a pretty good idea of what America was like.   To be fair, I don't find more liberal Americans to be quite like that. But red state Americans seem to be a lot like that. Never been anywhere and have ZERO interest in knowing anything about the outside world. One guy told me he knew what the outside world was like and it can't compare with the US at all. So I asked him where he had been.  ""Mexico and it was a shit hole,"" was what he replied.   It is just sad.",6년 전,0,

Yes, Islamophobia is real, and it's very much justified.   It's a person saying who got here in the US just 2 years ago, from a Muslim majority country (Bangladesh).   Bangladesh is one of the better examples of the Islamic world in terms of liberal view,- and still, I'm saying Islamophobia is justified. Then think what about Arabian countries, and how horrible they are.    All these sumps up to a logical form of Islamophobia. And it's also okay for the people that born here,- know nothing about other cultures,- but connect long beard with Islam, and then fear it.   They might be unaware of the Sikhs, or others that keep a beard,- but they are not insane.   Given a Muslim who were treated unfairly in the US gives a logic to make a video like this, and in that way, I can say its a goodly motivated video. But still, I wouldn’t make it for cheap fun.

@pavanSingh-ts5ym,"Sikh is not a religion, but a journey a path/lifestyle that enlightens and awakens the soul. Ego has been programmed into the human psyche for without it we cannot survive or progress. The real question is how do we control it? Sikh ideology teaches us how, as the panel remarked, ""We cannot throw another community under the bus"". We are taught to focus on ourselves before we blame others for our failures. As a Sikh, while traveling if I am asked to be searched or profiled, I have absolutely no problem as long as it is not in a insulting demeaning manner. I welcome the challenge and feel comfortable that other passengers feel safe as well. Allot of misconceptions get magnified in Political rhetoric, act and behave accountable, abide by the laws of the land, appreciate and respect the United States for all the opportunities being offered and you shall for the most part, remain content. Throughout Sikh history, we were persecuted and denied our basic rights, but the blessings of the Gurus and their leadership embedded a strong positive mental attitude, ""Chardi Kala"", always to remain in, Buoyant Hope!",6년 전,0,

@Casualbystander,"It may seem ignorant for Americans to not know what a Sikh is, but let's be honest it is a religion that you don't really learn about unless you come across someone who is Sikh and tells you or you stumble upon information on that religion elsewhere. America already has so many people from different cultures and religions, you can't blame them for not knowing every single one that inhabits America.   I am American and I only know what a Sikh is because I shadowed a Neurosurgeon that is Sikh, and he told me all about his religion voluntarily after we got to know each other pretty well. This is of course humorous to see people point at a bird and call THAT Sikh, but the underlying reason for them doing that is because they were just never exposed to the religion.   Now Islamaphobes who hate any Muslim but can't tell one from Sikh faith should be judged, since their passion should spark them to at least know about who they dislike.

In Sikhism it is believed fight together as team work is important and it supports alot in the time when its most needed. Sikhs wear turban as a pride its our religion and it defines who we are. We don't wear turban for fashion we have wore it after many sacrifices for the country and people. The sentence was for unity whenever their is a unity among citizens taht country would be hard to imvade by others and will succeed in every term.,6년 전(수정됨),0,

The problem comes in that Islam views some of the same things as Christianity as sin. So here comes the Sikh faith which doesn't have that view of those practices. Therefore just like a party DJ they are going to fade back on Islam now that Christianity has affected and up fade the Sikh faith.  That's why they are pushing a 3rd option political party because people see they have been had and are becoming conservative and since the Democrats can't stem their losses they want to scoop up defectors in the new net of independents.,6년 전,0,

@greatarabia8091,larry larry Jesus is not the son of God. God does not have a son or wife or daughter.   God is omnipotent.   Just because Jesus has no father doesn’t make him the son of God.   Adam had no father and no mother. Both were created in the same way.   God made them from mud/from scratch.   Many other prophets had miracles like Jesus. Moses had the miracle of reviving and split the sea.   Mohammad has the miracle of the Quran(predicted the future and still does) and once split the moon to prove he is a prophet.   There were literally thousands of prophets most of which we don’t even know about.    The Bible was translated numerous times from incompatible languages that’s why servant became son.   If you do that in google translate you’ll eventually see what I mean.   This is why in Islam we say: the only real Quran is the Arabic Quran. Any other language is a rough idea of a translation and does not convey the true meaning.   After all Arabic is the most advanced language in human history.   If you don’t believe me I can give you proof that’ll leave you in awe.,6년 전,57,
@greatarabia8091,larry larry There’s a bible that is very close to the real one. It’s called the Bible of Barnabas.    It proves what Islam says. Literally hundreds of years before prophet Mohammad was born.   I urge you to read it. It’ll shock you,6년 전(수정됨),31,
