@The_Foul_One,"Authority Doesn’t Take Your Wheel “Dogs and Cats” Nobody likes dogs in the system. No leashes for men, buddy. Either you’re a cat man or die. Nobody is going to walk you everywhere. Every priest would learn his lesson about human alchemy. Every consumer would learn their lesson about first impressions and how they don’t last. A hands off approach is ultimately more difficult to achieve. A hands on approach is failure for all involved. People expect a hands on approach to authority because they don’t want to believe in you and when you take the wheel they can resign to failure. Authority draws a line in the sand. It plays defensively and only strikes when you have crossed that line. What that means is that everyone has different levels and places of tolerance and that one must recognize other people’s lines as well as their own. These don’t always equal but can overlap and misbalance. You are adults, anyway. You steer yourselves. We don’t play that game where someone takes your wheel and steers for you. 1. You’re going to recognize the other. 2. You’re going to respect their boundaries. 3. You’re going to respect the boundaries agreed upon by the nation, or work within the system to change them. 4. You’re going to pick yourselves up and steer yourselves. No dogs or cat bashing!!! There is no such thing as a “Communist Cat.” Those are Communist Dogs. Haha haha. Cut the leashes! This is America. We are cats. Anthropomorphic animals are hard to nail down. Dogs are led around and are bloodlines to wolves, and cats are more independent and intelligent. They go hand in hand.",3주 전,0,

My mom would buy some of the products to help her out from time to time, but she would never actually use them. She said she didn't like the well it felt on her skin, but she thought if she didn't buy some she might lose a friend she held dear, and their family was struggling with money. It took a couple of years before she finally stopped selling Mary Kay and it took her husband threatening divorce to get her to stop, as they had boxes of unsold product just lying around their house. I never got told how much money they went into debt for, but both of my friends parents were working 2 jobs each for quite some time to recover from this.

@erwinshariffharahap,"MLMs can be used for illegal money laundering, integrating illicit funds into the legal banking system.  Multilevel marketing schemes, often referred to as MLMs, unfortunately present a vulnerability that can be exploited for criminal activities, specifically the nefarious practice of money laundering.  Individuals or groups engaged in generating illicit funds from unlawful sources can leverage the structure of MLM companies to disguise the origin of these dirty money flows.   By passing these ill-gotten gains through the operations of an MLM, which often involves numerous transactions and a perceived legitimate business model, the funds are effectively laundered, making their source difficult to trace.  This process allows the previously illegal money to seamlessly enter and become integrated within the formal and legitimate banking infrastructure, effectively sanitizing the funds and making them available for use without raising red flags about their true, criminal origins.   Only insiders understand how they function.  It is exclusively individuals with privileged access and intimate knowledge of these systems who truly grasp the intricate mechanisms and operational processes by which they function.  Only those designated as insiders possess the comprehensive understanding necessary to fully comprehend the internal workings and operational dynamics, allowing them to perceive precisely how these entities carry out their designated tasks and achieve their objectives.",6개월 전,1,

Enagic's Kangen Water business, with its MLM structure and misleading health claims, is frequently criticized as a scam.  Deceptive marketing, often likened to ""snake oil,"" avoids direct mentions of ""Enagic"" or ""Kangen Water,"" instead using mentorship claims to recruit.

Unfounded accusations can harm reputations and create unnecessary fear. If there are genuine concerns, it’s far more constructive to share clear proof or specific examples instead of making broad statements. From my perspective, Bhip operates under strict regulations and industry standards. They've been active for decades—if they truly were a pyramid scheme, they wouldn't still exist (worth thinking about). Let’s keep discussions factual so people can form informed opinions. Often, such claims stem from one person's negative experience or past unrelated scams. Just a reminder: good and bad companies exist everywhere.

Once they are ready to recruit you, and have you fill out their application, say to the recruiter ""I need a $2000 signing bonus to get started!"" The recruiter will object, argue, and debate with you about this. But if you keep insisting, and also explain how job recruiters often setup bonus deals and benefits, the recruiter will recognize the futility, then give up and say ""Sorry you missed this great opportunity!""  Seriously!  if the distributor is not willing to accept a partnership compromise (mutual cooperation) and only wants to do it all their way, then you don't have cooperation.

But the truth is that she did not actually sell because her money comes from the many distributors who are under her.  She even bought a house in El Salvador and makes money br renting it.  Mary Kay even gave her a private car.  But she does not know the hell and tears that the other salespeople go through to stay employed and pay her salary.  One day one of her top distributors was diagnosed with a serious disease.  This lady who has never believed in divine healing and criticized me and my family for having bible study meetings suddenly came crying to us, begging us to pray for that lady's healing, since that lady contributed a large percent of my neighbor's salary.  She did not care when the poor salespeople got sick because they were not top performers who made money for her.  But this neighbor of mine made a huge mistake.  She kept all her merchandise at home and had frequent parties to show off her expensive products and luxury home.  This creates an opportunity to tempt people to rob you.  One day her home was broken into.  Some of these companies do have good quality products but it is the way they scam people that is wrong.  This woman had thousands of dollars worth of products as w ell as a lot of expensive jewelry at her home.  The thieves took over $80,000 worth of products and jewelry that day.  What's worse, she saw it all!!!  Yes, she was entering her home and saw the house in a big mess and heard voices from the other rooms.  She decided to hide in a closet and not say a word.  She saw that they had guns so there was nothing she could do but hide and watch through a crack in the door how the thieves took all of her things.  She did not want to be shot.  The police came the next day but they could not find the burglars.  They gave her a free alarm system and offered to pay the monthly fee. This lady had to get therapy for her trauma and has since retired.  But I would be even more traumatized if I knew that I was abusing other people. If I was rich but I knew that the people who contributed to my wealth went through some serious abuses, I could not live with myself.

They kept mentioning their recognitions and how they were on the Forbes list, etc. They offered this ""cheaper course"" for licensing which happened to be $125, I felt like an idiot for agreeing (I'm a people pleaser).They had finally given me the name of the company (which hadn't been mentioned until then) I went home to search up the name and all these red flags came up. I tried canceling my credit card asap but it had went through.   And then I got charged a $25 MONTLY FEE!!? LIKE WHAT (this was a month later; I had cut contact with them at this point) I emailed that I had never agreed to it and that I wanted to cancel my subscription, (they said that I had agreed to it by signing the agreement contract, always read the fine lines) and only through that claim was I able to find out I could get my refund for the $150 as well (which I had to keep persisting for (they only refunded portions at a time,maybe hoping I wouldn't realize)). At the end I only lost $25, which is still bad but compared to the $200 I would of lost... yea  But nonetheless, I learned my lesson. This was really crazy to me especially seeing my old friend who tried to recruit me, I entered his insta profile and it literally seems like that company is his whole personality now. Definitely wouldn't call him a friend.  ALWAYS BE AWARE!!!       btw this was Primerica.",1년 전,3,

Now I am at a stage where I can influence people to see my result & buy this product genuinely. If one isn't bothered about the high price but result oriented for own health benefit than its the best product. I do admit the high price is definitely because of MLM structure. But there's one caveat specifically for this product if its sold like the other branded product. It won't be a success as ppl would fail to achieve their weight reduction goal. The way this MLM ""Net"" is structured by keeping a community which may guide you the right way to use the product & kind of Win Win situation to both as a beneficial consumer & profiting using MLM to enrol more ppl.

@Karthikch913,"Leaving this here for anyone who came across this video. John Oliver is brilliant. I had this video in my mind when I was being lectured by an MLM agent. Helped me better understand what was happening. This is my experience.   I'm from south India. I moved to punjab (a state in north India) for studies. I always knew what a pyramid scheme was. But I didn't know how these people get you. There are several organizations that operate in India, in my home state and EVEN within my university that I was studying in. They operate is most big and popular universities. The people that I mostly ran into work for ""E-biz"". But there are several other companies. Their front is that they offer software engineering courses to learn programming languages and business management software. But they're an MLM and you understand how they operate at this point. The real problem is how they get people to join them. They start off by bullshit motivational monologues about being your own boss, having people who work for you, how much you could gain by joining them in terms of personal skills, business skills and this is how rich tech CEOs like bill gates and others started and function. If you're not convinced immediately, they'll try to get you buy flexing things they or others in the company bought and tell you that you can earn a lot of money and if you're still not convinced, they'll you the sentiment card, asking you if you'd like to pay back your parents for all the money they spent on you for your higher education.  I ran into 3 different people (three times into the first guy, who didn't remember me even for the 3rd time). All of them spout the exact same bullshit about being your boss, learn management and personal skills, earning money, making parents happy. They'll also ask you to call your parents to talk to them instead. Don't. If you understand what's going on, walk away. You won't make any money from this, their courses are garbage and outdated and can found on the internet for free. But what's sad is that... All the people who try to recruit you... Are also students who fell for the scam.   Don't fall for any of this. If you wanna hear them out, sure... But don't waste anything but time on these people. And even that, only if you don't instantly understand what is going on. I didn't either when I ran to these people for the first 2 times but still, I'm lucky that I only lost a few hours to these people and not money. Be safe.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@RansieInNeverLand,"Recently I moved to North England and while  discovering the locations and deciding where eventually rent my own house, I rented a room with a live-in  MLMer landlady  and that turned out to be the worst housing experience of my life. Since day 1 into her property she started annoying me with these overpriced essential oils, trying to convince me to ingest them. That  they would treat cencer, covid, MS ( I am affected by MS and she was informed about it ) and all the illnesses. I told her straight away that I hate MLMs and that my hate towards them started in 2014, when some lady into NuSkin tried to suck me in the net. So I told my live-in landlady that never ever I would have been buying even one of those products. She than grabbed my hand and against my will poured tons of frankincense essential oil, which is supposed to be the most expensive of that MLM company oil....I could have called the police because that could be considered as an assault and she was lucky I did not have any bag reaction. She left that bottle by my stuff in the bathroom hoping I would have been suing it. I have just ignored it the whole time. She took it back. Seeing no luck with the oils, she started annoying me with supplements...not even that worked. So not being able to use me and my disability  for her dirty MLM sales goals ( like saying this lady with MS looks sooo great because he ingests and treat herself with the essential oils ) and not being able to make me subscribe, she asked me for help in her MLM s@@t: like helping her with MLM videos, with instructing her downline..... Like having said nothing to this lady when I repeatedly told her I AM AGAINST!!!!! This lady's philosophy in life was : "" hear and see  only  what you wanna see "".... It was clear and she thought she could have  had success with me by pushing  again and again and again...And she had also  been exploiting personal growth to try to convince me and get me subscribed or to make me buy the goods. Unfortunately, there is  absolutely no way to convince me buying  anything  MLM.  This lady, not happy of the MLM bullshit, wants to become a spiritual medium, so to  prey on people who  are struggling emotionally  as she was hoping to do with me and my disability with the MLM thing.  She is a person programmed to lie. There is much much much more but it is not relevant to MLM.",2년 전,3,

@CM-re1vm,"My wife got drawn into the Mk makeup ""business."" I warned her against it but she's a grown woman who can make her own decisions.  The women she was working with were...odd.  They shared a cult-like appreciation for the company.     So of course she bought a ton of product to keep available.   It didn't sell.   After sitting on the shelf for months, I asked her what she planned to do with it.  She snapped at me saying ""I'm going to sell it!""  This was starting to cause friction in our marriage.  I felt second-place to their cult.     I lost my temper when she said she wanted to fly to a national conference on our dime.  Hell no!  Thank god she didn't go.   She asked me to come to a dinner at her, I guess ""boss's"" house.   I couldn't believe what I heard there.  Some of the women they invited were single moms or women with limited income.  They flat out told them to fly to the national conference.  Can't afford to? Put it on the credit card and pay it off later!  Yikes.   I told my wife we were leaving.  We argued all the way home.   The turning point was when she had makeup parties at our house scheduled, and nobody showed up.  She had enough.   I said don't be surprised if those ladies don't talk to her anymore if she quits. Guess what,  that's exactly what happened.   They shunned her and the product that's sitting in our house, expired.  They were so phoney.   They're your friends only when you're buying product from them.   There's a happy ending.   She realized I was right, we cut our losses,  and now she helps people stay out of these pyramid schemes.

Now looking back, it’s obviously bullshit, but back then, the naive, 18 year old me didn’t know any better. The way they portray themselves was so enticing that I was almost drawn in.   And then, we went for the second seminar. They were trying to “educate” us about a magnetic mattress that they were selling. It’s bullshit, but I was magically drawn in.  And just as I was about to go for the third seminar, I googled the company. There were so many negative reviews and many of the anecdotes stated that on the third seminar, they’re going to make us call our friends and families to buy the product. No way in hell am I going to sell a dodgy, overpriced product to people I cared about, so I called up my friend to tell him “Let’s GTFO!” And we escaped.

@47ravenlord," @ValFatherTime  The video was obviously part of the research, intelligent people research a wide variety of sources, including Youtube. I have no idea why people like you hate Youtube so much....many Youtubers are highly educated people with professional skills that put them to work on the platform to make decent money in their off hours and often find they can actually replace their actual job with it on their own terms. Anything they say can be easily verified through more credible sources and they often summarize and lead you down very relevant paths.....they did hours and hours of research for you, put it into an easily digested format, and you can cut out the guesswork and verify whatever you need. Btw....You're= You are. YOUR was the word you were looking for. Looking down in the other comments and finding out YOU'RE criticizing someone for being smart enough to turn down an obvious scam that you were too dumb to avoid was hilarious. You are a stereotypical angry victim of a pyramid scheme lashing out at people trashing it because your subconscious is telling you that people like them are the reason you are failing in your pyramid scheme. YOUR comment was 9 months ago so i guarantee by now you have entirely failed in your MLM scheming and have moved onto other ways to humiliate yourself. Just had to pop in and toss a kick at you for being such a nasty person to a complete stranger for absolutely no reason other than possible envy that she is obviously more intelligent than you :)",1년 전(수정됨),0,
@jujublue4426," @Saasou  I live in France and got caught up in a German MLM for a few months, there's also a lot of American and Italian MLMs in France so no it's not illegal in Europe sadly. Technically pyramid schemes are supposed to be forbidden and MLMs are supposed to make money by selling their products but in practice you are pushed to recruit and distributors focus more on recruiting because recruiting makes much more money than selling (especially when you try to sell products you can find much cheaper in supermarkets).",1년 전(수정됨),1,

@williamchristy257,"Warning to everyone out there I was roped into something like this being a fresh college grad. I studied business in school with an interest in marketing. After school I looked for a lot of marketing jobs and ran into a “opportunity” that sounded nice. It was a smaller marketing firm that had little requirements to apply. I was supposed to be going in for a marketing executive job. The interview process was really short. It took as little as a week to get on board. Basically if you showed interest and had a pulse you were in. They prayed on young individuals like myself and there were a lot of people in my company that didn’t even go to college. They promised this “great opportunity” to “climb the ladder” and said within a few years you could reach a position to make six figures. When I went into my first day into the office they were really transparent about what I was actually going to be doing. Then I realized it wasn’t the job I was looking for at all. They wanted my to do face-to-face marketing, direct sales, door-to-door, cold-calling… whatever you want to call it. The company I worked for operated under a number of different names. Which was another big red flag. I would work 70-80+ hours standing outside for about 11hrs a day soliciting donations for charities such as Amnesty International, Doctors Without Borders, Covenant House, WWF, Greenpeace, etc. everything was scripted. When I first started I thought I was actually doing it for a good cause because I did believe in NPOs. The company culture changed when I didn’t hit my “numbers” I was looked down upon, even humiliated. I’m not a type of person that would ever see myself in sales. I’m not a hard seller and often times when someone told me they didn’t have the money or only wanted to donate one time I’d direct them to the charities website, which was actually frowned upon. Why would they scold you for not upselling for a charity and why would a charity not want to take in any money offered? That was another thing that was fishy. The main company I worked with out for Dallas was Lumos Marketing Group, but I actually worked under another company in the same office as Lumos called Rose Gold Talents. The same office also had a number of different names like Jamrock, Amethyst, and Synergy Solutions. Lumos Marketing Groups parent company was Credico. Which has a number of class action lawsuits against them for poor working conditions and labor law violations. The office was very generic with little furniture. We were put into this room every morning called “atmosphere” where we’d recite what they considered “fundamental principles” it’s was very cult like and they would tell you to not everything down even if you learned it 100times before. I lost connection to my friends, family, even myself… they people I knew where the people in my office. Often times there were also relations with people in the office too because they were the only connections and relationships we had… this caused a lot of drama. You were told to reach certain quotas and would also go on “business trips” around the US to different offices which were also all very generic from Nashville to New York… these offices also operated under many different names. You were promised a great opportunity but had to recruit people under you and train those under you. I often times had leaders above me that were younger and didn’t even really know what the hell was going on either. Then you’d reach a point where you could “open your own office” and the more people you hired underneath you the more cut you’d get out of the profits…. Which really made me think how much of the money was actually going to the cause. I highly advise anyone looking for a job to be very wary of these companies….",3년 전,2,

He then started contacting his formuer students with a ""great job opportunity"". As he was a dear and credible professor, many accepted to meet with him. I was one of these students who gave him the benefit of the doubt even after countless red flags during his pitch. At the meeting, he brings a second person (his ""partner"") who starts spewing all of the clichés, talking a lot but without saying anything.  I just said I wasn't interested and left. Then I warned my college colleagues about what had happened. Two friends later told me this professor tried to recruit them a couple of weeks later.  I feel sorry for this professor, to be honest.

You get paid when you add value to the marketplace via sales, or building a team. The corporation pays you more as you add more value.

Because if I'm ""building a team""...and you've built a team...and this conference I'm supposed to attend has thousands of other sellers who have ""built a team""...who the hell am I selling to?! If I'm am independent contractor who's main job it is to sell a product or service and that's supposed to be the real way I make money (because if this isn't a pyramid scheme, making money off of recruiting shouldn't even be a thing), I've recruited my competition! And so has everyone in that conference. And so many other conferences across the country or across the world.   All of them and their ""teams"" are now in competition with me. If I'm trying to be the #1 seller, I need ALL you bastards to get the hell out of my way and stop selling. I want all of this revenue for myself! I've just made my job harder with a ""team"" and so has everyone else! This would be fine if there was a limit to the amount of sellers that could be in the company (you know, like a traditional, legitimate sales job has so that everyone isn't stepping on each other's toes), but there isn't!  And THAT is the part that I would love for you to try to make sense. Please, we are all waiting to hear how it makes good business sense that when you're supposed to be selling a product or service, the compensation plan tells you to instead bring in more people to also sell, diminishing the people available to sell to. Even if you try to take the route of ""Fine, I'll only sell"", you are literally locked out of most of the compensation plan unless you ""build a team"". You will not make a liveable wage if you don't.  There is one last thing I will add here. Your comment is from about two years ago, it seems. Unless you were trolling, you sadly drank the Flavor-Aid (the real drink given in Jonestown) pretty hard. Maybe someone preyed upon you at a low point in your life and in your desperation, you were here trying to also convince yourself that this wasn't a pyramid scheme. I really hope this is the case. Happy people generally do not join MLM's. They've usually hit a low point, are depressed, burnt out from work or life, and are desperate for anything else and this...makes them a prime target for an MLM. Maybe that happened to you. It's never too late to get out. But if you genuinely still think MLM's are completely fine, I'd still like an answer to my above question.",8개월 전,0,

@stephaniebarto6141,"I never considered joining an MLM in my life, and I think it's because I've always been very simple minded about how I look at them. I don't think people who get sucked into them aren't stupid or gullible, I just think they are overthinking things.  Basically I've been acquainted with tons of people, and even close to a couple people, selling all sorts of different mlm products. I didn't think about it deeply or know much about mlms. I just noticed that not one seller stayed with the mlm company for any length of time, usually less than a year. But I've never in 42 years known a person to still be with the same mlm company for a long time, say like even 3 years.     Also, of all those mlm sellers I knew,, not one single one actually made a real profit. The BEST outcome I'd heard was ""oh I got out of selling that because it was hours and hours of work and I made almost nothing. You'd make way more with far less work just picking up a part time minimum wage job"".  Mostly I'd hear stories about of the how mlm seller actually lost a bunch of money and never sold enough to cover costs.   I'm simple minded about it. I don't believe for a second that all those people I've encountered trying to be an mlm seller just didn't try hard enough or whatever and failed. If a business model is so shit more than 90 % of people who become sellers fail to make money then I'd never consider joining one. I don't care how fast you talk. Don't over think it.

@googiegress,"Tell her to prove it to you. People love when they can lord it over on someone who resisted them. To do this you have to be willing to meet with her and have her show you everything, and you're going to approach it as an observer without always arguing about it. But set up some ground rules.   #1, she has to show you her actual accounting for her ""business"". You get to see receipts. You both go over how much money went out and how much came in. This way she can't hide the fact that she's losing money.  #2, she needs to go to a doctor with the Herbalife stuff in its packaging, and the doctor needs to explain to her whether these are good things and whether she should replace meals with them. But here's the catch: she makes the appointment with you in the room, and then later you call the hospital. Explain that you don't need them to give you private medical info, you just need to speak with Dr. So-And-So. When you have that person, explain that your mom made an appointment, she's bringing in this herbal supplement stuff, and you're coming in with her for the visit, and you're worried that it's all unhealthy unproven stuff and not real medicine. Most doctors are gonna be primed to tear the living daylights out of the supplements after that conversation. Again, present the situation, but let the doctor think it's all about his professional medical opinion. The best of all would be bringing in the health claims made by Herbalife like if they say it cures specific ailments, because the doc will be able to shut that down instantly.  #3, inoculate the rest of the family against her. Sit down with them in person, in private, each one alone. Explain the situation, say that they need to never give her money for this stuff, or participate in the company, and she's being scammed so she'll probably lie and ask for money for other things but it's really because of her Herbalife. And most importantly, they can never tell her that you said this.  #4, as much as you can, try to prevent her from going to cult meetings. When she says there's a big conference coming up, tell her you had already planned a getaway for just the two of you (and then go do that).   There's a chance she finds out you were working against her and then you find out which is stronger: the cult's grip on her or her love for you as a mother. It's possible for a person to be a lost cause because they became too brainwashed. Remember not to let her ruin your life.",3년 전,2,

I thought it was some kind of volunteering gig at a food bank or homeless shelter; it was Amway. I'm usually a big pushover, even with people I don't know very well, but because I'd watched this video, I knew enough to be suspicious of this girl and to ask the right questions about the company, the products, and how they operate.

@chocobot987,"That sucks, but they should have stoped when they realized they had like a month or two with red numbers. Sadly, they can't see their financial reality because they're: a) Desperate or b) ignorant or c) greedy Compensation plans are always on company websites, you should study them before joining. If the company asks you to buy a lot of products and recruit a certain number of people each month so that they can pay you, it's totally a pyramid scheme because most of the money comes from new distributors, instead of customers. If the product or service is way too expensive, there's nothing special about it, doesn´t have scientific backup, there's another big red flag.  It's sad that there are still companies like these operating. I dare to say that mosts ""MLM's"" are pyramid schemes in disguise, and even if you join a consumer based MLM, you have not much chances of making lots of money out of it. It's a lie that everyone can have success in that industry, because not everyone likes to sell, and not everyone has great communication and leadership skills. A business that is primarily focused on getting distributors, is bound to fail.",3년 전,0,

@Jo-razz,"He basically was saying yes it is a  Pyramid scheme but we found a loophole.  The only way you can really make money is to recruit and recruit,  but we do have a product, & that is a loophole.  You don't really make money on the product because our distributors that have to keep recruiting,  ARE the customers.   IF they don't buy the products then they don't get the commission for recruiting.  It's brilliant we have Built-in customers that have to buy  products.   We have a constant flow of income coming into the CEOs pocket.  There might be a few of the distributors that started when we 1st started this scheme,  Before the market was saturated,  that made money but just a few.   IF they get too big we just cancel their 1099 contract, &  And that $20000 a month income suddenly is cut off. ( Insert diabolical left here)  About the 99% to 80% of people probably  will only maybe make a couple dollars, if they work non-stop  or most will lose money by trying to keep up  the rank,& having to buy the products. So money is out then in..  Usually resulting in debt.  The beauty is, they'll just keep doing it and doing it. we'll keep telling them you're just not working hard enough and and you just need to stick it out longer.   The time freedom BS, they'll be on their computers or phone 24/7,  Working non-stop but we'll brainwash  them, to think just because they're sitting at home doing it, or on a beach doing it, that they have ""time freedom""while their children are at their ankles begging for attention. EVIL GENIUS, AT ITS BEST.   Remember it's not legal because we found that loophole.  An evil scam at its finest. Gross🤮 Side-note- they don't actually get a free car. You just get a $500 car bonus, for hitting a rank. You only get $500 bonus each month so you can make the car lease payment. You have to  Maintain your rank each month to get the money for the payment if not even if it's the next month if you do not maintain that rank you do not get that $500 bonus.

@googiegress,"Your two examples had different types of ills, so I want to give the other set of downsides for each:   With taxi apps, the company is actually running a taxi service even though they claim they aren't. The way they're doing it is illegal, because cities require taxis to register and receive a medallion authorizing them to operate. So Uber et al operate illegally and siphon money away from more local taxi companies. There's also less accountability, because Uber will argue in a court case that the driver was an independent contractor and whatever they did was totally on them.   With short-term rental apps, the property owner will see wear and tear on the property. They have to either take care of the repairs and room turns (cleaning, laundry, restocking, etc) or hire a local to do it; either spending more time or more money. The app takes a LOT of the room rate, so you're best bet is using the app as marketing and try to get people to book on your own website instead.   The last statement you made is crucial, and far more important than the rest: if you want your community to economically improve, you need to spend locally, and keep those dollars circulating locally as long as possible. So it's not just spending your money to buy bread from a local bakery, the bakery needs to spend ITS money as locally as possible. Meaning its business loans need to come from a local credit union that has local investors. Its employees need to live in town, or preferably in the neighborhood, so their paychecks get spent here instead of three towns over where they live. And buy as little as possible online! Remember that money is illusory from the civilization-level perspective, what matters is the value created and its permanence; money is economic lubrication but it is not value in itself, so it's the action, the activity of money, which facilitates prosperity. If we could get together and agree on a different currency, like a local town-based currency, opting out of the dollar would be a huge benefit to the extent that everyone actually did it.   And no I'm not talking crypto. That's just a scheme for stock bros to pump and dump away everything you're willing to give (while convincing you that you could be the dumper if you're quick and clever, and massaging your ego to make you feel quick and clever). It's worse than a government-backed currency from a civilization standpoint.",3년 전,6,

No good business will tell you desert your family or friends if they don't buy your idea. Like every business entity, there is nothing wrong to invite your friend or any family member to have a look at a business plan or products or services. Everybody has the right to reject or accept a product or service or idea whether from MLM or traditional company, there is nothing wrong with that. If you buy a fake product or item from a company before realising it, does it make the whole industry that that company belongs to a scam. Not every one succeeds in everything. In the traditional business industry not all companies succeed. Some companies fail after a few years and some don't even grow beyond 5 years minimum. Even in employment not all employees have a successful career. Some are even laid off for poor performance. Mind you in every industry there are bad ones and good ones. Some people come together to form a company in a particular industry do swindle or scam unsuspecting people. Thus that make that industry evil? I don't think so.

@worldatmyfingertips7771,"I guess the reason why people thinks MLM is a ''scam'' or ''pyramid'' is because they don't realize that it's not about recruiting and recruiting people like crazy without purpose nor meaning. It's all about the PRODUCTS! Basic, everyday products consumption, which you will not find in any supermarket nor amazon, no matter where you go in the world you can't find the same quality, THAT is what makes the magic, it's simple math, all you have to do is recommend the products that are absolutely awesome and have a lot of science, money and resources invested into their development. It doesn't get more simple than this: Do you like Costco? Sam's club or just your regular local supermarket?? what products do you always buy?? which ones you can't live without? Would you go door to door selling them and telling your friends and family how much you love those products and why they should buy them too? Just to make Costco or your regular supermarket money while you get nothing? not even a thank you? No? I wouldn't!! XD XD, but what if Costco and sam's club etc told you, ''hey, we have this special program in which you can recommend those products you love and if somebody comes to our store and buys them you get one dollar, that's it! just one dollar for each product you recomended and was sold at our stores!!'' Would you recommend those products then?? I most definitely would. It's not my job, it't not my business but hey, I'm making a dollar for each product!! It doesn't hurt an extra dollar in my pocket, right? Same as it doesn't hurt one bit to talk about your experience with your products without having to get out there and knock on doors, harrasing strangers to tell them about how happy you are with those products or services. Now, MLM companies take this promoting method to a more systematic and better structured level. The people that you invite to join in have to consume their products in order for you to get a small commission (which once again, are the most basic products that you will purchase anyway somewhere else where you will not get any additional value, certainly earning  way more than a dollar in the process, lol). Imagine you recommend these awesome products to many people and many people buys them, guess what? you get a small commission for each and everyone of those peoples you invite and are consuming excellent, top quality producs of all kinds!! On a monthly basis................is this clear enough????? You need more??? Let's say you always go to one particular movie theater, perhaps you like the customer service there, the popcorn is the best, the seats are the most confortable, it's super clean and neat, you love that place!! and imagine that cinema chain had also, like Costco in our ficticious scenario, a promoting program so you get 50 cents for just recommending the cinema to your friends and family, you and they get some membership card for free and they have to say your name or promoter id so they can say they are buying the movie ticket at their place and are there thanks to you so you can get your 50 cents commision, wouldn't that be amazing??? Now, lets take this a step further just a bit and say you not only are happy going to that cinema every weekend, you love it so much and so on but also want to make money so what do you do? You start making new friends, you expand your social circles, the time will come for you to also tell your new friends about this great movie theater that you enjoy so much and guess what?  It turns out, A LOOOOT of people have heard of that place and were curious, also, a looooot of people likes to go to the movies, can you see where I am going with this?? lots and lots of potential to make extra 50 cents but it gets even more interesting :D :D, what if ''Cineplex'' (The ficticious cinema for this example), in addition to your 50 cent per new guest commision also gives you bonuses, say, 2 dollars for each 2 people in one same day that goes to see a movie at their cinema, voila!! you can make even more money!! The possibilities are unlimited!!.................so, bottom line, any type of business can become MLM, would you say also that COSTO, SAM'S, Mc donalds, Starbucks, Google,.....Youtube (wait! YOUTUBE?? yes!! They have a lot of viewers right? the guy who owns it makes the most money!! And everybody who advertises here are the losers, the ''victims''. He's at the top of the ''pyramid'' XD) are also pyramids?? no, right?, it all takes a little creativity. USANA, AMWAY, JEUNESSE, HERBALIFE, you name it! are NOT a scam. Period. They have had their bad moments, scandals perhaps but are not scams. Not only are they growing, in the middle of pandemic and all while many previously mentioned, REAL companies's franchise stores had to close for good. MLM businesses not only thrives but also keep growing EXPONENTIALLY while many regular businesses are going bankrupt. So, who are you going to believe? the naysayers, even though they are the majority? (but also the majority of mediocre, broke and sad people are those 95% of the world's population to begin with so no surprises there) or the actual and real sales figures and upward trend statitistics? I don't know what you call that but to me that is a great business opportunity, unless you have millions of dollars to open your OWN Costco or mc donalds store, or are brilliant and rich enought to sell the MLM idea to your local supermarket or cinema according to my own examples, go for it!

Personally, I would not join one MLM company that has very little time in the market, because it is SUPER hard to get started, I would rather join one that has a major presence in the market with sales trends going up and booming. I am sorry to hear that however one thing you must consider is that in order to make money you must be ready to learn their system, you must be open minded, you need to have businness vision. In the beginning you earn little money while the work can be very hard but with time if you keep learning and training you will begin to see results, the money making system in MLM works that way, you don't see much results in the beginning but over time your earnings multiply as you build your team and your network of consumers grows, the beauty of MLM is something called residual income, which is all the commisions you earn through the sales of products throughout your entire network. The myth about MLM is that the only goal is you have to sign up so the guy who invited you gets a commission without any further compensation other than that but what you are doing in reality by inviting people to see your businness plan is selling a mini franchise of the company, like mcdonalds, you see, MLM companies manufacture products of extremely high quality that can't be purchased in stores, millions of dollars in research go into the making of these products but they don't spend much on advertisement as the marketing process is up to us, the associates of these companies, you sell by recommending products to others which in my opinion is something we all do on a daily basis anyway, but in an MLM company you make money whereas recommending a cheeseburger from mcdonalds for example you don't earn a dime, the only way to purchase these products is by becoming a member.....it sounds like a lot of work and hassle but trust me, it pays. With the right leadership, training and hard work you can easily retire in  5 years....It's not a perfect way to  plan your retirement but is waaaay better than working a normal job and retiring old and tired in 40 years......I hope this info helps, you caught me by surprise, lol. Perhaps I can elaborate more on it, if you are curious on the subject. I just like to talk about it, I'm not gonna insult you with offers or anything lol, I only recruit people I know personally. Friendly chat is all.....cheers!...",4년 전(수정됨),0,
@chomar97,One of my friends got caught up in a mlm. He tried to recruit me an others to the point every conversation was about his product an how rich the people were who got him in. They took him to big houses an pool parties to persuade the sign up. Eventually I stopped hanging around him for almost a year. He signed up a few people but nothing life changing. Come to find out he got fired from his full time job trying to promote the mlm in the break room at work. He is now left the pyramid scheme an back to normal now an has seen the light.,4년 전,1,

@ColonelGraeme,"There are many detractors of Multi-Level Marketing BUT there are many who absolutely love MLM. Ordinary people who are making a Living Wage and building a Financial Legacy. There are many regulated businesses that actually have good intentions through Cooperative Decentralized marketing and profit share. It's all about the product, service or system and the obligation on you to be involved. If you could buy a great product and at a competitive price or a great investment with a better than the bank return and there was no obligation to do anything but enjoy your purchase or investment WHY wouldn't you participate. Buyer beware applies to any purchase or investment? Remember John is not on youTube for nothing He is a businessman He is sensational and controversial and gets paid on hits the more Sensational the more Controversial the more hits. Ka-Ching, Ka-Ching for John. You see Bad news sells and Good News is categorised by bad news peddlers as Too Good to be true, or a Scam or Pymarid selling BUT what if it's not BS what if it's true and real?  Meaningful Research and Due Diligence is the key as is Social Proof - real people making real money over real-time frames.  There are regulators all over the world who watch for scams and frauds and even after John has supposedly exposed and defamed these scammers has he championed an action against any Scam or Fraudulent scheme, put his money where his mouth is? Or would that reduce his hit rate and thereby his income? We believe and have found Real alternative Income and Wealth creation systems. There are Ultruistic people and Filanthropists who are sharing the Wealth. We are helping people all over the world, including 1st Nations people, find the right product or investment to suit their risk profile and financial status.

I know a few people who are roped into it and these people have been completely brainwashed into thinking that they are “entrepreneurs” and how they’re “retired at 17, retired at 21”, etc. Alex Morgan, the Executive Vice President (I believe that is his title) was involved in 2 KNOWN pyramid schemes.

@sammyruncorn4165," @amrita3000   I don't wanna be rich either (,neither am I poor). Alright... I don't know really how to answer to this without sounding condescending or like I'm ""feeling- morally-above-you"". I don't know what immigration or origins have to do with the debate... english isn't my motherlanguage either... I'm confused why you were talking about that (other than to inform it might be difficult to read your text because of the language barrier; rest assured it's the same for me). I just say it straightforward: One doesn't have to be in the same situation or has to have the same priorities as another person to empathize with/ relate to them... I can for example understand why a son comes to kill his abusive father although I haven't experienced that myself (good relationship towards my father) or find it to be a critical (in some way wrong) decision (to kill another human being). Same as being understanding towards someone (and their mentioned arguments) who doesn't share my political side/ values or my habits ... To assume someone has to have the same priorities (money) or has to become the same way the person they defend is... just... plain dumb/ narrow-minded. And children don't have to become like their parents (likelihood, but not an absolute), so to insult someone elses children or make ""unnice"" predictions about their future decision is pretty dumb (and shitty towards an unrelated person).  Are you your parents? Your uncle, aunt, grandfather? I would have liked to go without insulting words like ""dumb"" or ""shitty"", but there was just nothing other that came to my mind (so sorry for that). Please... just inform yourself about logic. A pear is a fruit, but not automatically an apple because it is a fruit. Stuff like that... Otherwise you wouldn't draw faulty conclusions.

Now, you dont understand other ppls' views, I dont understand yours. To you this person is a hero, To me they are not. I will reiterate, a hero is someone who is not greedy and believes in hardwork, not shortcuts.And I mentioned I am an immigrant because if you make any comment about Mexicans/Blacks people assume some sort of privilege.

@sammyruncorn4165," @amrita3000   Well I hope for both of us to calm down. I could understand a bit more about what you meant with this explanation. At least why you mentioned your immigration.  Though I didn't make any assumptions about it until that point/ so far, that's why it baffled me that you suddenly wrote about it.  But Again (!)... you make assumptions/ conclusions about another person without sufficient proof (here in the form of written words). I don't think this woman is a hero (others in the comment section explicitly did). I reacted towards your answer towards someonelse, who praised her for not taking others with her down the drainhole (by signing them up for the scheme, though realising it is fruitless, but trying to push the debt towards others).  I wrote that I found your answer to be a ""petty and at the same time arrogant"". You wrote you were hoping for her children to screw up (, which I found to be a childish reaction) and assumed yours wouldn't. Which seemed to me arrogant and narrow-minded, since no one can tell for sure what will happen to anyone. Life is not entirely predictable. I sincerely do not hope for your children (if you get some) to go into debt or screw up another way in life (no matter who or how you are nor what your opinion on the internet is).

It would be great if they could just go through life being good people.

Skyrocketing health costs were caused by politicians stuffing their wallets and purses from the health care insurance companies who resisted true competition.   Until covid hit, there were record LOW levels of unemployment.   American manufacturing was coming back as well, thanks to Trump's policies.   The student loan crisis was caused by the government taking over the loan industry.   None of those problems came from trickle-down/supply economic policies, and the rich will always get richer, so get over it.

@madmachanicest9955,Covid was made worse by our for-profit  healthcare system. the policy of as-needed delivery lead to shortages for ppe and other equipment. A lower number of hospitals because of consolidation and low overall maximum Hospital capacity all cost-saving measures meant to max profits definitely killed people.  the 2007/2008 subprime mortgage crisis also known as the 2008 housing bubble was created by backs backing investments with flexible rate mortgages over-investing in this scheme led to the almost complete collapse of the global banking system. this scam played out before on a smaller scale in the 1920s. it was outlawed in the 1930s. it was made legal again in 1984 and tanked the global economy 24 years later. the government outlawed this scheme again in 2009 and the banks' Lobby AKA bribe Congress to make it legal again in 2015.  the student loan crisis was created when Richard Nixon privatize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the late 1970s the student loan program as effectively completely unregulated from then to now. this means the loan program can lend out an unlimited amount of money and colleges can charge whatever they want .50 years of unchecked greed did the rest.  all of this is public knowledge you can find on Google and in an afternoon.,4년 전,0,

( this sow growth mostly effect the extremely rich)  it works by splitting the ecomoy into a highly regulated free market system and publicly owned taxpayer-funded utilities. this was how the western world ran its economy until the 1980s.  healthcare, public transport, education, power/ water resources, the internet, and most infrastructure are better run as publicly-funded institutions. a lot of this stuff was privatized into for-profit corporations in the 1980s.  this is not my opinion either all of this is either historical fact or based on statistical analysis.

Maybe they did film that documentary.. maybe Rainier was a middle man and just revealing what he knew about the Great Plan beyond This Test Run that supposed to have revealed the whole thing we just saw being taken down.. the test run with all those experiments. Experiments.    Maybe the smokescreen of all this outrage helped them dive even deeper into the shadows with a nice nest egg of wealth and logistics & shit at this point fully functional to start widening their grasp of whatever .. lol..  bdsm wonderland /Gilead (something much worse than what is already out) they're wanting to build. Maybe. Now they would have via fake death and all this media circus the help of better controlled privacy AND the edge of already controlling this narrative here... they're all set to start The Next Step as ghosts.

You have to ""sell"" a monthly quoto one way or another or your discount is lowered, and/or you lose other commissionable rights.   Those knives are actually great.

I had an uber driver shove her Herbalife crap at me even after I politely said no.

She said I was wrong , that I was the people she was told to stay away from and that I was ignorant. I told her she was also ignorant to the fact that these products weren't natural, that she was obviously spending more of her money than earning it and that she was inviting people to take stuff that has a history of being harmful. She just ignored me the rest of the way and my rating on uber went down from 5 stars lolol. I also had the misfortune to be thrown into a Marykay meeting with the disguise that it was only a harmless makeup class, now those ladies are terrifying haha they were more into trying to find my weakness to use it in their favor.

I know he sound official with all his pseudointellectual comments however most of these are derived from false information no true scientific fact is conclusive or complete without empirical evidence. Sure I could put up inform to contradict him but what does all that mean Bubkus without evidence.   https://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/article/S0168-8278(08)00313-9/abstract   I will even pay for it myself of course you can go longer but then in the end whoever loses should pay we don't even have to use Tanita scale body composition monitor we can do doctors tests if that's what you're more comfortable and familiar with. I know he sound official with all his pseudointellectual comments however most of these are derived from false information no true scientific fact is conclusive or complete without empirical evidence. We will post the results but YouTube for all to see. If what you say is true John Oliver then prove that Herbalife is a scam if we wanted to read shit on the Internet we don't need to watch a video. Herbalife has been approved in 95 countries it started in the 80's over 40 years ago and I've never known anyone to die personally myself of liver disease or die taking the products only get progressive health results. As a matter of fact it's listed on having no banned substances on the label because athletes around the world use it for greater performance.   The Vietnamese Olympic team which was sponsored by Herbalife paid to go to the Rio de Janeiro games in Brazil won gold for the first time in 60 years on the products.   https://www.vir.com.vn/stores/news_dataimages/hung/122018/31/10/in_article/croped/making-our-world-healthier-and-happier.jpg   What do you think they give Olympic athlete's a different product? Athletes around the world have posted evidencing different levels health progress in most of these athletes have no Association with Herbalife. Cristiano Ronaldo was not merely a paid brand ambassador his body was engineered through the products as his mother was a distributor and had to wait two years before approaching Herbalife. To create his own sports range to better the reigning football star at that time was a Herbalife ambassador Leo Messi and Cristiano Renaldo achieved greater success after this Leo will always be a great sport as they both pretty much nose to nose in their success in above the richest men in sports due to the consumption of these products.   https://www.pinterest.com.au/pin/394557617337770602/  Cristiano Renaldo before and after Herbalife mum distributor.   Which is policy in Herbalife that's their integrity no one represents them that don't know what the products can do for you and it's more stringent for celebrities then norm people. He is a source of great pride to the Latino community and that's why Herbalife is so strong in Spain! Did you ever ask yourself why no Herbalife hater video has ever had it's presenter using our HERBALIFE main products range and videotaping it?   This is not an honest way of making a proper review if you don't take the challenge you are a bullshit artist and or a bum this is my credibility as it reviewer or presenter of any type.   I did empirical testing for 4 years three of those years I consumed 1 to $200 worth of produce straight from the markets I walked 20 kilometers for five to seven days a week for three years then for the last year I took the ultimate program and did no exercise Herbalife got me weight loss results 800 times faster. I'm sure John Oliver Tech team will delete this post but I will repost it again and again and if I have to create a new account I will continue to repost because I've lost too many people to bad health. I'm the oldest of three girls in my family and yet having been on these products since my late 20s to now 47 I am often mistaken for the youngest sister when I am actually nine years her senior and the closest sister to me who's two years my junior has head breathing problems slight diabetes bone problems and she has more Gray hair than I do the youngest has also had breathing problems and patent balding and she is a pharmacist.   If Herbalife doesn't work then there must be a lot of very lucky people that consumed the products because I've seen a lot of incredible results over the years in their before and after's my results are hardly isolated there are millions of stories like this all around the world. In the beginning I guess I thought these people were exaggerating and then the pictures were docked or they were sucking it in and the rest must have been starving Herbalife is not for everybody but to say it it doesn't work is just lying to yourself. and at first I did think they exaggerated about the results and perhaps even doctored their photos or it in but as I continue to use these products and saw them and myself shrinking I realize this is not the case. I could photo blast this page with before and after's what does that all mean to you considering we know photos can be docked - if you have a grain of integrity if you care about your friends and family then do empirical evidence through testing everything else is just BS.,4년 전(수정됨),0,
@shailendrashinde9410,John Oliver is a real gem,4년 전,1,
@SusieQSydney,"It's very easy for anybody to demonize an entire industry by speaking of it generally instead of specifically and without interrogating those within the industry to be objective talking to experts in an interview like manner to answerable to any charge you bring.  Having journalistic Integrity when doing a review where you've actually tested the products and or services yourself let alone call out an industry on scam in this video he's not being conducted one iota of real research I'll bet those participants are all paid too that's like Bill Ackman this how lazy this hack is - I could easily mimic what he does taking the very worst part of John Oliver's industry make him look stupid - why even stick to his industry of journalism after all true pyramid don't sell any but membership so Herbalife isn't a pyramid so he has to go around and call it a legal pyramid. Without testing a product and calling out a company for product that actually work is quite frank an ""legal"" scam because media can slander quite ""legally"" and most people don't know that because when you misrepresenting or highly exaggerate your claims it is illegal if you didn't put a video camera in front of your face isn't that funny.  I could even push the point that his in show business as - Lask Week Tonight with John Oliver is more entertainment or rather farce then facts I could easily justify his industry less journalism more entertainment therefore show business well that industry is open slather for cult like behavior and or being the ultimate circus and not in a good way you would see how ridiculous type of reportage is across an entire industry   You think a health company like Herbalife a cult in show business they intentional make their inner circle cult like and bring up bohemian Grove     because this place is actually real where grown men run around butt naked and burn effigies and god knows what else because this is industry secret which quite frankly like the illuminati is not exactly a secret any more. The only ritualistic burning I've ever seen Herbalife conduct is a luau in Hawaii.   Bohemian Grove is actually a real club Hollywood honchos and captains of industry and super elite belong to  https://thebolditalic.com/the-most-secretive-club-in-america-486c7607694b   Do I care about whether the executives of HBO or John belongs do that or participates in that or not why get into small details like accountability when we can generalize is a lot more easier judge across a whole entire industry should we even care if it's the right industry when your hating on something why doesn't any pertinent matter throw in a few expert panel written jokes not even my own as long as it's popular even if we're no contender for a Peabody award in journalism at least we'll get viral hits as hitters are few and failing whiney haters are many.  In Herbalife the most for cult like behavior I've ever seen very fervent applause for my Mark Hughes the founder if someone help solve a complex global problem I think the least you should be is grateful but Moreover it's very important he is front and Centre in order for it to work properly a product of nutritional is a very personal thing.     It's not easy to convince someone who has not idea about your product's benefits to swallow it unless you do it first and necessitating being a product of product particularly because we're so greatly mislead these days by so many like big pharma and or the food Inc. who doesn't necessarily have our backs always.    It's important to play follow the leader kind of an industry to gain trust and that may appear micky mouse and silly but it's critical when stakes are life and death.     How would you like to be consuming products that you know somebody wouldn't give to their friends and family let alone themselves.     Another example of John Oliver's hack journalism is take people's words out of context. The congress woman might never gain her position entirely from Herbalife but she certainly had an edge over other senators due to a great deal more energy she'd had gained and if you ever took the product you would realize that what she meant which could easily be akin to an unfair advantage when on average on Herbalife for over a year would experience generally two days' worth of more time produced from more energy due to working longer and sleeping less a week    And that's what she means when she says I'm a product of the product. However John twisted it around to mean something completely benign.   However I gained a great deal of business wisdom which did add to my business acumen from Herbalife directly from Jim Rohn was a world class business philosopher in a company that would give me a chance where most hadn't because of prejudice in other companies not just because your health is your wealth a lot of great pearls of wisdom.   As for any ritualistic behavior I've never been to any events or heard of any events where people actually burn effigy's which is what happens at bohemian Grove amongst biz elites and God knows what else because even though the top echelon of media attends these things they don't want anyone to know let alone broadcast what goes behind those secret meetings whereas at Herbalife annual training events everybody is welcome except for the management training however anybody can earn the right with a little bit of elbow and or investment it's definitely not an elitist thing.   At these events people the most ritualistically cult like thing you see is people are given big fat cheques bigger and fatter than any cheques that you've ever seen in any other industries if they even do bonuses at all and show appreciation for hard work and sometimes small efforts like rock stars – its big fun big  big fun.     If every company treated their sales team with such respect I expect they'd produce annual billion dollar turnovers too and the most animalist I've experiences ritualistic wise is a dance off with the prettiest boys and girls but high of exhibitionism of skin is probably less than what you can find at a high end party or night club as I did some and all just good clean fun and voluntary hey if you got it why not flaunt it - yeah baby for science of how to look good and feel great of course lol!    Not like show business with less than friendly community of casting coach calls, ridiculous entitlement of those who can fit the stereotypes being IT (what IT is one could never really know) just to get in or even child molestation claim and it's not just the reject but the start who are treated this way like Cory Haines story and or Judy Garland not small player but the most famous stars. It's not even behind closed doors it often the main event or TV and made into a movie.     Where appearance is everything and must be gained at all cost it's a wonder some people suicidal in this industry and or die premature death occurs it is why Mark Hughes created Herbalife in the first place because mother was one of it's victims as a struggling actor in Hollywood that why he wanted a safe and awesome supportive way to help people look and feel great.   No there's only one fair way if you must judge a company by reviewing through through extensive use the products and or real industry knowledge within that company with unbiased eye and strong knowledge preferably by interviewing those who designed the business and or industry experts with HBO and John and or all Haters of Herbalife never could do.   Google states:   Network Marketing or Multi Level Marketing (MLM) is being taught at more than 200 colleges including Harvard Business School.

@SusieQSydney,"​ @Ellie L  ​​ So please tell me where I can get a balanced healthy meal for $1.06 US or $0.65 US wholesale so I can save money because this is the exact price of the Australian products converted to U.S. dollars just because media prevents it presents itself professionally it does not mean that it's done its research. I don't talk about things I don't know about let alone post videos to potential million unless it's a fictional or joke but there would be disclaimers not like this hack anyone listening to him for health or business is more stupid then he is.     If this is if this is your idea of expensive then please tell me where I can get my meals for cheaper I think the only way that you're goanna find meals cheaper than that is make your own on a free charity line for rescued food organization that gives way reclaim food because your idea of expensive will put any food business let alone company out of business      The price quoted you is that the vanilla shake which is a liquid replacement meal. This journalist hack would have you believe that you have to even go on a program to make health progress but fact is this is what mark used the founder of Herbalife sold in the very beginning which was just the humble shake from his car boot and that is not of itself is a balanced a liquid meal replacement shake which is basically two thing TCM (traditional Chinese Medicine) and Modern Science from space food program.      Herbalife cares a great deal about making its products affordable and accessible to all and keeps even its programs about the price of small McDonald's family restaurant meal so you will find it's always cost effective because they feed a lot of need children around the world and have their own charity which sponsors 220,000 orphaned children around the world      John Oliver base his whole argument on what was started by Bill Ackman a privileged hedge fund manager       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Ackman#Early_life_and_education      Ackman was raised in Chappaqua, New York, the son of Ronnie I. (née Posner) and Lawrence David Ackman, the chairman of a New York real estate financing firm, Ackman-Ziff Real Estate Group.[5][6] He is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.[7][8][9] In 1988, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree magna cum laude in Social Studies from Harvard College. His thesis was ""Scaling the Ivy Wall: the Jewish and Asian American Experience in Harvard Admissions.""[10] In 1992, he received an MBA from Harvard Business School.[11]      whose real agenda was to make a billion dollars bet from bringing down a reputable company who ended up losing hundreds of thousand trying to topple a honest company by slandering by bribing Herbalife executive as he couldn't get find anybody high even who's left who would go on the record I have to say any really trash about an exceptional company which       Let's be frank most companies there's more than one who'll left it who would go on the record say something bad about it without being paid but that is how good this company is it's people and consequently Bill behaviors is illegal.      Though we knew he could get away with it because Herbalife as a no argument policy which it strictly adhere to from the very top down management to even wholesale consumers to maintain membership which is keep with its good wholesome company image but I'm tiger I don't let people destroy company I love for their own petty agendas.      Why the heck would you take health advice from a scrawny guy with a head full of white hair like Bill Ackman and I'm not trying to be ageist here but he's no poster boy for good health so why take his health advice he looks like he could easily play Mr. Burns in The Simpsons with one foot in the grave? As for business advice Ackman is not exactly self-made Billionaire an entitle trust fund baby what does he care about the plight of the common person who's not above bribing witness to testify against Herbalife.      Don't get played by scoundrels.    https://time.com/3830741/john-oliver-trevor-noah/      getting a bit of double chin and he clearly colors his hair judging by when his off air tint it or something again not ageist but no poster boy for health.      https://www.celebritysector.com/tv/john-oliver-sued-by-coal-mining-mogul-bob-murray-over-geriatric-dr-evil-remark/      Early life and education[edit]   Oliver was born on 23 April 1977 in Erdington, Birmingham, West Midlands, England,[10] to Carole and Jim Oliver. His father was both a school headmaster and social worker, and his mother was a music teacher. Both of his parents are originally from Liverpool, Merseyside. His uncle was the composer Stephen Oliver. William Boyd Carpenter, Bishop of Ripon and court chaplain to Queen Victoria, was his paternal great-great-grandfather.[5][11] Oliver learned to play the viola as a child.[12]   Since childhood, he has been a fan of Liverpool FC, noting in interviews that ""my mum's family are from Knotty Ash and my dad's family are from the Wirral, so supporting Liverpool was very much not a choice"".[13] Oliver was educated in Bedford at the Mark Rutherford School.[5][14][15]   Following secondary school, he studied at Christ's College, Cambridge. While a student there in the mid-to-late 1990s, Oliver was a member of the Cambridge Footlights, the university theatrical club run by students of Cambridge University. Oliver's contemporaries included David Mitchell and Richard Ayoade. In 1997, he became the club's vice president.[16][17] In 1998, Oliver graduated from Christ's College with a degree in English.[18][19]      And John Oliver a bit of a trust fund baby too while was not as privileged at Bill Ackman background was by no means middle or lower class upbring with tied to Queen Victoria and educated at Christ College Cambridge where founder where actually Royal parentage by Lady Margaret Beaufort, mother of King Henry VII What again would he know or care about the plight of the common person if it's doesn't directly benefit him to do so and for a guy who was education in an elite school like that with a headmaster for father you'd think he'd learn a thing about doing proper homework.      Failures in business are always going to be the majority of any industry and because you can't see long or the big picture it even took several decades for this enterprise developer see it you can get fooled misrepresentation and if you're going to judge across and industry why not the whole industry       How many super successful hedge fund managers do you know of in the world can you count among your fingers I bet it's just with one hand well how many celebrity presenters do you know probably by face and by name because that's how many there are only a hand full of them but then I ask you if you count how many high rollers are in Herbalife even in one country  to commit to memory because that's there how many there are there.       Herbalife has created more millionaires than any other company and the best chance an average person I believe for becoming wealthy I've ever known whether you are in it or not because good foundation it teaches you       Why should any try to destroy their reputation why in a time of health crisis when it's been touted this is the generation children may die of obesity before their parents.",4년 전,0,

A bot can't talk to you via phone contact me and I'll call you back. IF I WORK LIKE A MACHINE IT'S BECAUSE I'M ON HERBALIFE IT GIVE BOUNDLESS ENERGY ROFLMAO!!!  They blocked me so had to use another account HBO can't handle the TRUTH. I know the system since I was on it since I was young and build organization for a living - tested HERBALIFE on my own body for decades she only had to use the products to get leaner NOT even exercise which she clearly has not done - she is not selling vacuum cleaners health is very sensitive issue and reputable health product need absolute commitment after all it's on going thing and better applied for life require you teach by example that's part of your contract if she didn't want to do that she could get a job but SHE SIGNED up not merely to be a distributor but a wellness coach that's the deal because food is very personal nobody is going to take your word for it that the damn thing work just because you say so you must lead by example that is ethnical business that's more then I can say for you or John.  That's what she signed up for which is A privilege and yet she took that privilege now trying to destroy a reputable company GAVE her a break where she couldn't get else where because seriously you think she's burn her bridges with every potential company in the future by byatching about any company whether it's true or not publicly if she piles of options (at least in her minds anyways) if she didn't get a fat payout from HBO if you believe then your super naïve this clearly is an action that would limit your options in life and the act of desperate person. Company owner don't hire and their trained not to hire desperate people not if they know what's good for them.  Because she's a fat lazy bum - which by looking at how fat she is clearly indicates she has not done that. I love fat people I am fat people to Asians but I don't go on the record lecturing know a thing about health to millions on YouTube like I'm an expert that's just stupid - otherwise tell her to go on the products on video I'll buy the whole her damn inventory off her in a week if she doesn't get a results - it was harder to invent the product with blood sweat and tears of what deserted orphan which Mark Hughes was he was even martyr for the cause and all she had to do it is follow a proven system success she didn't even do step one use the products how's that NOT A LAZY BUM?  And when you lose weight it's virtually impossible without people asking how you did it who will clearly want the same solution if she can't even do that then she could have got 100% of her money back in a whole year which she also did not do because it was more profitable easier to get paid by a TV network to lie about her experiences - she's doesn't care about anyone else but herself and her needs not all who are help by Herbalife or could potential in future just herself.  She's didn't talk for free and lie she's not a victim but herself and you think she's a victim your an idiot particular because you haven't use the products - my details are on my S icon to date no body has take the challenge not her not John not Bill not anyone else because you are all full of shit my grandmother died and other members of my family early then they need to - needlessly because of idiots like you and John Oliver who listens to these bums and bums are the masses that's why they're voice are the loudest but NOT TODAY!!  In my books she's always be the laziest bum distributor in Herbalife paid by hypocritical double chin rep John Oliver of a company TV networking HBO that's currently firing thousands of their because they can't make their business work yet wants to lecture about this. HBO sells violence and sex as most TV networks do and yet dares to lecture on morality and business virtue when they are a failing TV network that merged with Warner Bros which didn't save arses because upside down pyramid and upside down pyramids do not work wow no surprise there to anyone with common sense it doesn't work and THAT IS WHAT YOU CALL HYPOCRISY ON STEROIDS!",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@finchisneat,"Now This is the secret where the website company is really making ALL their money. The websites would sell for from 99$ to 1250$ or whatever you can get them to pay (it's nearly free to make remember) then once you were desperate after making no money doing free advertising, which we would 100% tell them they could do when selling them the website and they could do, but would make no money. 50$ was a real score if you were doing free ads. So then advertising sellers call and explain that  you never make money in ANY business if you don't advertise, otherwise how can they find you???? Right? And they would get them for thousands, or even tens of thousands of dollars. The specific company did mostly guarantee traffic and email blasts. Maybe search engine submissions I don't remember...

@SusieQSydney,"So John Oliver putting all BS aside when exactly did you take the products or joined the company to know they don't deliver their promises like Bill Ackman. Chicken soup isn’t even found in most countries and if it is it’s not high volume product why didn’t you query the main product like the protein shakes which are the meal replace oh because they taste as delicious a ice cream - Oh you never do that because you both have zero integrity with hidden agendas. Bill Ackman does with his aging old body and head full of white hair (which I only mention because really what’s money compared to your life)  Otherwise you'd be eating humble pie and you know it and consequently Bill has lost a Billion dollars betting against a reputable company guess what Herbalife isn’t exactly owned by just your mom and pop operators who are easy financially bullied  https://www.investopedia.com/news/billionaire-bill-ackman-dumps-herbalife-ending-5year-war-betting-against-it/#:~:text=According%20to%20TheStreet%2C%20Icahn%20has,to%20%241%20billion%20on%20Herbalife.  Because Bill tried to bring down a good company to try and make himself a easy billion with a company with a zero bitching policy they'd be an easy mark that delivered on results who likely not sue for the slander you and he produces however some of these corporate high rollers who actually sit on board  Carl Icahn who owe part of their success to Herbalife went into bat to protect his interests.   I've taken the products barely any that's how good it works and everyone tells me that I look decades younger then my age being the oldest sister I still get mixed up by my own family for the youngest who is 9 years my junior there's 3 girls in my immediate family amongst the siblings they've had asthma, paten balding, diabetes, breathing with nasal blockages and bone problems with teeth falling out I have none of those problems and I'm the oldest one must be because I'm lucky - I'm lucky I'm with Herbalife that is but you can't preach at home where they would rather burn their nostrils then to try something different and god knows I've tried. and you didn't even bother to hide your lack of substance well when your rich powerful and as entitled well you can  just pay someone to be a ""better looking version of you to play you"" yep that's what everyone should aspired to.   I wouldn’t deny the MLM pyramid structure is a hard sell would test the metal of anyone it's not my favourite part of the business but engineering wise - it’s one of the most formidable structures there is guess it's what's made me strong and it works this company grown year in year out and multi-billionaire enterprise by your own words should we run with a structure that doesn't does work your industry run with a structure that doesn't work or rarely creates successes and often chews up people and spits them out putting aside failures how many people in showbusiness prostitute themselves and even commit suicide in their climb up on your corporate ladder and never succeed in the most unduplicable business of all business models ""The Super Elite Presenter or STAR"" business where prostitution is not even behind closed doors it's actually the main show - the Harvey Weinstein of show business has shown us that lately how much integrity there is in show business your industry you right argue how can I cross collate rate with Film and journalism well how about Fox news treats there female presenters with utter disdain where there countless sexual harassment law suits should you be responsible for your whole entire industry?  See how I use my skill sale person ship and merge a whole entire industry to make you look bad with every shit thing that’s gone wrong with it when it's got nothing to do with Your tactics are ludicrous at best and absolutely dirty pool at worst and highly in accountable not that HBO haven't presented shows about sex workers but they're hardly the only thing HBO shows but when you’re demonizing a entire company for ratings why should you care about what's fair and or who you hurt.   https://www.herbalife.com/Refund-Policy  Your so called victim had a whole year which she chose not to eat the products and not to refund her products and get 100% of her money back because she wasn't doing what's right and then bitch about it why she's lost money yeah.   While it might be ideal for every company to allow people to buy up all their inventory and do nothing with it they'll go out of business if they allowed that to happen and that would be worst everyone involved.  All sales average and have been achieve is all recorded it was always been recorded even from the start there was always 3 carbon sales slips to fill and sales records to put with these receipts. With every International business pack everyone that signed up is given details of average earnings for distributorship for recent years incomes but sales based work are performance base most people who join have the mindset to buy a job and the other bulk so called distributors want the wholesale for their own consumption pushing numbers below minimum wage across the board and all of these are counting towards lowering the average numbers even in a normal job if you don't put in the hours you don't get paid but if don't be in business don't become a distributor - take a salary jobs clearly there's plenty of those.   https://herbalife.referrals.selectminds.com/   The 24 shake formula one liquid meal $1.06 USD retail a meal you can't buy Macdonald meal for that so how is that expensive? Let alone give you measurable health results!  To say there isn't salary jobs in Herbalife is an outright lie life is no body can care more about your business then you - if you don't intend to follow the disciplines of business and following a system - don't become a distributor or get a job and do it one the side part time which is what's recommend you do anyways.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

Making money is always steep a climb it's always dirty somewhere if you look hard enough, you’d find dirt or another if you can find one that is an industry totally squeaky clean it's probably more than inherence, philanthropy and entitlements based then an real industry and generally someone else did the dirty work for them otherwise I think we’d all rather be doing that instead.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

So give me more reason as to why we should all be shitting on a company that have created more millionaires than any other - let's all do that - great idea John let's shit on a company which gives freedom to countless many and takes care of 220,000 orphans in 54 countries how many orphans has HBO taken care of in 2020 any where near as much.  And putting aside charities or philanthropy how many great Holidays with celebrities and or media personalities have we been with or know of none and I know one or two even date one.  I didn't even qualify for a free holiday in Herbalife in my youth sure I bought and inventory of any industry but all distributor do but I’ve bought more in other industries and they never gave me any of that and I got to ride around in limo in Hawaii with air tickets paid by my upline (that’s how generous Herbalifer’s are) I will eventually paid him back one of these days but haven't as yet.  So should we all shit on hardworking legit pyramids or MLM schemes because it works and haven't folded like most companies because your success is based on merit and not someone carrying you and or not weird entitlements base in your industry mostly on looks (well if you look like a cult you are a cult leader) great journalistic integrity there John not just talent in an industry mostly filled with a sea of male white faces at the top of the rung and presenters are not always predominately based on merit but more like popularity criteria’s or rating potentials.  Which is hardly in one’s control and to belong to an industry one would hardly call diverse. . .right you are!   Let’s talk facts John if you were a presenter even an ounce of journalistic integrity you would interview your claims of scam to its claimants and give them a chance to defend themselves you would actually present facts not just dressed up facts crossing judgement against a whole entire industry instead of the board of directors there’s very ugly word for that kind of journalism - I know you know what it is so I’m not going there.  If Herbalife is responsible for the whole industry then HBO is responsible for all which is ugly that happens in show business how's that for lazy journalism it’s a wonder you don’t like health companies and you make Last Week With John Olive is a ridiculous farce no one should really take seriously and discrediting yourself and HBO in the process.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

In my own mind if no one gets rich but we all get healthier in the process I'm good with that though that’s not Herbalife reality if you even check their annual bonus comes in 7 figure what do you get as a bonus as to their presenter exactly not 7 figures check I’ll bet.  I can sleep pretty well at night and if that happen to everyone in the world even better.   Yeah why do the math because if you did you'd figured my real life scenario in my line of other work in enterprise development and technology or any high yield job and or business it’s still a dead end we get paid as much as $300 per hour but because time always going to be a shrinking commodity so it doesn’t matter how high you get paid like 8 million dollars annual salary like yourself John.

They get the photo of the item off of Wal-Mart or Amazon, then post it for sale on their site like ebay. When a customer buys, it ships from Walmart or Amazon.

Possibly in 117 degree heat.   Another common one is putting out the pitch and getting hammered 1-on-1 by sales people before you get your free meal. And it's always ""sorry folks the food should be coming soon, but here's another speaker"" and it's several hours of that. So if you want the freebie, you're being attacked for way longer than you thought ahead of time.   Just remember that whatever the deal they're offering, it'll always be way worse than they make it sound. That's their business model.

If they can prove that at least 30% of revenue comes from product sales, they aren't technically a pyramid scheme.  Of course, that 30% model does not preclude distributors who often are required to purchase band stockpile the products, whether they sell on to consumers or not.  If legislators had the fruit and veg to stand up to Amway at the time, Herbal Life, essential oil scams, quite a few Trump ventures, wouldn't be the problem they are today.  Distributors make so very, very little in the bottom 90+% in these pyramid schemes, sorry mlms, that it lower annually than a minimum wage job pays weekly or monthly, depending on scheduled hours.  And that minimal money made is BEFORE they have to pay for start-up kits, licensing, promotional materials, and most often fronting the money to purchase the products they hope to sell to consumers.",4년 전,0,

Also, submit a complaint to the FTC at @t If you don't, then you're part of the problem.     Amway has 2 major problems, and most MLMs have at least one of these issues:     1. The products are overpriced, which makes them almost impossible to sell to customers and results in Amway being an illegal pyramid: @t , and also according to the FTC and SEC websites and previous court decisions and settlements; and     2. The Tool Scam is hidden profit for the top level distributors only, and the vast majority of distributors operate at a net loss as a result: @ This is RICO fraud.

Make a complaint on the FTC website: @t     Although there is no federal law defining pyramid schemes, the FTC has a long and successful track record of using its Section 5 law prohibiting “unfair and deceptive” business practices to go after MLM scams: @t which states, in part, “Not all multilevel marketing plans are legitimate. If the money you make is based on your sales to the public, it may be a legitimate multilevel marketing plan. If the money you make is based on the number of people you recruit and your sales to them, it’s probably not. It could be a pyramid scheme. Pyramid schemes are illegal, and the vast majority of participants lose money.”     Read about these and much more at these websites: @t; @t; and @t   Contact me to help shut down Amway and other MLM scams.     Watch this video about Amway and other MLM scams, then forward it to everyone you know, except for current Amway IBOs, and encourage them to do the same.

Bad actors have existed for decades such as Enron the most powerful and corrupt energy company in America  Or  Valeant Pharmaceuticals known for buying up the competition and raising drug prices.  Have all been exposed by Hedge Funds for lying to the public, false accounting, and stealing from customers. We didn’t ask for them but we need them.

@bbddgurl,"You say “I had him draw out a diagram of how the business worked and he literally drew out a pyramid. I then started to ask him if he saw how running a business like this is extremely problematic and that he was probably being taken advantage of.” I’m pretty sure that’s how your job works. It’s called a “pyramid organizational structure.” A pyramid organizational structure functions following the shape it's named for, with one leader at the top, a small executive leadership team below, and tiers of managers leading down to the bottom team of employees. The owner makes all the money off of the people that work for him. I’m sure your employer brings in let’s say millions off of you and other employees hard work but then gives you a small fragment. He leverages and duplicates off of his employees. But you are limited to what he thinks you are worth. Luckily, not all MLM’s are schemes and gives you the ability to duplicate and leverage your own business and there is no limit to what you can make. You just have to put hard work into it.   There are goofy people in everything that do goofy things. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t work. Like the gym there are goofy people who go to the gym. There are people who said they “tried” the gym and it didn’t work. Obviously the gym works. There are a lot of people with great results from the gym. So that means the gym works you just have to learn how to use it efficiently and majority of society are to lazy to put in the hard work it takes to get the results you want. That’s why there are only few people with great results. Learn to seek to understand rather than discredit things you don’t understand. Like I said there are some goofy things out there that are scams. Just make sure to look from credible sources ( FTC, the euromonitor, BBB) and make an educated decision before calling it a “scheme”. Amway has been around for over 60+ years. I’m sure if they were a scam the FTC would’ve shut them down by now.",3년 전,2,

Not good but compare this with the success rate of new start ups. We don't make fun of people here.

I realised in the parking lot, by the Amway stickers on every second bumper, that I was getting into a pyramid scheme . He continued magging me to join for months and eventually brought in his tax records. I noticed that his income certificate from Amway fell pathetically short of the expenses involved to earn it, and we claimed a substantial loss for him. Later that year I claimed similar losses for several losers in his 'Amway congregation' and some of them are still our clients, but none have made a net cent from Amway ever.

@nathanpearl2321," @jodiv2928  The sales tax at yeard sales thing is fairly new, but eBay has been collecting sales tax on used items from the buyer for quite a while.  When they first started , an advantage to buying over eBay new or used was no sales tax unless you  were in the same state as the seller. Then the govt. started making them collect sales tax on new items nationwide, and finally on used items as well. I agree with you 100%, though. Tax was collected on the item when it was sold new, and if it is collected again on a used sale, then it is being double taxed. Same thing on used cars most places, sales tax collected every time they are resold, even if the car has had 6 previous owners. On the MLM people, of course they are selling new items even if they are outdated, but my point was that such MLM people may have to get a sales tax number.",4년 전,0,

@timothyulrey4508,"I wrote down ALL of the reasons I hated MLM's below and found ONE that solves ALL of the reasons to hate MLM's!!!  PROBLEMS: 1) Recruiting only is the business model, and members are forced to buy stuff they can get at walmart for cheaper - that's just dishonest. 2) The products have cheap competition that work perfectly fine (walmart has shakes, makeup, food containers), which means less selling for you! 3) Per #2, you are forced to keep buying overpriced BS to stay in the business. 4) Per #2: MLM members are forced to cry, do jumping jacks, lie, etc., to make the sale because... there is no reason to buy it from them; it's at Walmart. 5) Inventory: I don't want boxes of overpriced crap in my house. 6) In person demos: no thanks - gas is expensive and traffic stinks 7) Saturation of salespeople: most people you approach have already been approached (plus can buy the crap at Walmart) 8) Need vs Want: No one actually needs this crap.  WHAT (so that the problems solved - below - make sense with context) What if the product gives both members and customers access to lawyers for $1/day? It/s mobile, not something you put in your body. Covers up to 300 hours of pre-trial/trial defense (you get sued - kid falls down your stairs), they write your will (easily $500 alone w/out it), you call with questions about where to start with something (advice), they will write letters to the DOT if a snowplow breaks your mailbox and you want payment for it, a small business owner needs legal docs reviewed before submitting (15 pages), you get a speeding ticket and want a lawyer to rep you in court and keep your driving record..... legal services that are pre-paid / free with the membership of less than $1/day?   WHY IT SOLVES EVERY MLM HATRED PROBLEM 1) Recruiting: Let's say a member ONLY recruits. That's still perfect. Why? Because the EXACT people who join MLM's are folks who need money - those are the SAME people who benefit the MOST from the service as they could never afford a lawyer, but now they have prepaid legal services on speed dial, literally speed dial, and then, they help others to solve 2 problems at once (no money, no lawyer access). I.e. Your recruits ARE your best target market whose lives literally get better. BEAUTIFUL.  2) Lawyers are expensive. Now they are on speed dial with dozens of common lawyer services - from big to small - totally pre-paid = ease of mind. 3) Covered in #1, new members' lives are literally better and more secure now for less than $1/day.  4) No crying, jumping jacks, or lying. The product is a no-brainer and cannot be bought at Walmart.  5) It's mobile.  6) Zoom and automation. Your content becomes omnipotent marketing where your digital self is talking to people about it while you sleep.  7) Since you do not know anyone with this service (or very few), then clearly it is not oversaturated = tons of opportunity to make cash! 8) People need lawyers. Plain and simple.  So why not make money with it? Click my link below! Let's make money together without my preying on your buying cheap crap every month!

@SusieQSydney," @elliel8626  It's very easy for anybody to demonize by speaking generally about an entire industry instead of talking specifics without interrogating those within the industry to talk objective talking to experts in an interview like manner and to be answerable do certain perspectives. Integrity in doing a review where you've actually tested the products and or services yourself let alone call out an industry on scam that your video is about he's not being conducted one iota of real research that how lazy this hack - I could easily mimic what he does taking the very worst part of John Oliver's industry make him look stupid why even stick to his industry of journalism - I could easily justify his industry less journalism more entertainment therefore show business and as we all know show business is open slather for cult like behavior and or freak are great in a circus and not in a good way you would see how ridiculous type of reportage is across an entire industry.  You think a health company like Herbalife a cult in show business they intentionally make their inner circle cult like and I could bring up bohemian Grove    Because this place is actually real where grown men run around butt naked and burn effigies and do god knows what else because club is highly secretive which sounds quite frankly like the illuminati a secret society that not so secret with also ties to movie industry and or government. The only ritualistic burning I've ever seen Herbalife conduct is at a luau in Hawaii.   Bohemian Grove is actually a real club where Hollywood honchos and captains of industry and super elite belong to  https://thebolditalic.com/the-most-secretive-club-in-america-486c7607694b   Do I care about whether the executives of HBO or John belongs do that or participates in that or not why get into small details like accountability when we can generalize is a lot more easier judge across a whole entire industry should we even care if it's the right industry when your hating on something why doesn't any pertinent facts matter throw in a few expert written panel jokes not even one's own as long as it's popular even if we're no contender for a Peabody award in journalism at least we'll get viral hits on YouTube as heavy hitters are few and failing whiney haters are many and number is all that count with social media not credibility.  In Herbalife the most for cult like behavior I've ever seen very fervent applause for my Mark Hughes the founder if someone help solve a complex global problem I think the least you should be is grateful but Moreover it's very important he is front and Centre not for bragging rights but life long commit for health system to work properly a product of nutritional is a very personal thing.     It's not easy to convince someone who has not idea about your product's benefits to go ahead and swallow it unless you do it yourself and necessitating being a product of product particularly because you're so greatly mislead these days by so many like big pharma and or the food Inc. who doesn't necessarily have our backs always.    It's important to play follow the leader kind of an industry to gain trust and that may appear micky mouse and silly but it's critical when stakes are life and death.     How would you like to be consuming products that you know somebody wouldn't give to their friends and family let alone themselves.     Another example of John Oliver's hack journalism is take people's words out of context. The congress woman might never gain her position entirely from Herbalife but she certainly had an edge over other senators due to a great deal more energy she'd had gained and if you ever took the product you would realize that what she meant which could easily be akin to an unfair advantage when on average on Herbalife for over a year would experience generally two days' worth of more time produced from more energy due to working longer and sleeping less a week    And that's what she means when she says I'm a product of the product. However John twisted it around to mean something completely benign.   However I gained a great deal of business wisdom which did add to my business acumen from Herbalife directly from Jim Rohn was a world class business philosopher in a company that would give me a chance where most hadn't because of prejudice in other companies not just because your health is your wealth a lot of great pearls of wisdom.   As for any ritualistic behavior I've never been to any events or heard of any events where people actually burn effigy's which is what happens at bohemian Grove amongst biz elites and God knows what else because even though the top echelon of media attends these things they don't want anyone to know let alone broadcast what goes behind those secret meetings whereas at Herbalife annual training events everybody is welcome except for the management training however anybody can earn the right with a little bit of elbow and or investment it's definitely not an elitist thing.   At these events people the most ritualistically cult like thing you see is people are given big fat cheques bigger and fatter than any cheques that you've ever seen in any other industries if they even do bonuses at all and show appreciation for hard work and sometimes small efforts like rock stars – its big fun big  big fun.     If every company treated their sales team with such respect I expect they'd produce annual billion dollar turnovers too and the most animalist I've experiences ritualistic wise is a dance off with the prettiest boys and girls but high of exhibitionism of skin is probably less than what you can find at a high end party or night club as I did some and all just good clean fun and voluntary hey if you got it why not flaunt it - yeah baby for science of how to look good and feel great of course lol!    Not like show business with less than friendly community of casting coach calls, ridiculous entitlement of those who can fit the stereotypes being IT (what IT is one could never really know) just to get in or even child molestation claim and it's not just the reject but the start who are treated this way like Cory Haines story and or Judy Garland not small player but the most famous stars. It's not even behind closed doors it often the main event or TV and made into a movie.     Where appearance is everything and must be gained at all cost it's a wonder some people suicidal in this industry and or die premature death occurs it is why Mark Hughes created Herbalife in the first place because mother was one of it's victims as a struggling actor in Hollywood that why he wanted a safe and awesome supportive way to help people look and feel great.   No there's only one fair way if you must judge a company by reviewing through through extensive use the products and or real industry knowledge within that company with unbiased eye and strong knowledge preferably by interviewing those who designed the business and or industry experts with HBO and John and or all Haters of Herbalife never could do.   Google states:   Network Marketing or Multi Level Marketing (MLM) is being taught at more than 200 colleges including Harvard Business School.

@spencerschulman7767," @SusieQSydney  Wow I'm sorry you took all that time to write that without realizing how unhinged it makes you look. People can deduce that MLM products are not quality goods for a number of reasons, mainly that your earnings come from recruiting a downline and skimming off their commission. You know that every MLM sells retail items that are already in stores or online where companies have been making huge profits. The revenue generated comes from the sales of product. Retailers don't generate revenue by recruiting distributors buying in bulk. When I sold on eBay and I had products that were in high demand, I'd be an idiot if I went around looking for other distributors to whom I would offer wholesale prices for them to sell for retail. That would be insane if profit was my goal. MLM's most sucessful members are the people with the largest downlines. Why is compensation more dependent on recruiting others to while revenue from the unit sales isn't even a factor because the highest earners are the most successful recruiters? Why do these companies with a good product need to rely on the distribution network for profits? Quality brands are only concerned with manufacturing the best possible product. Burt's Bees isn't telling Rite Aid they need to find more Rite Aids, who then must find even more Rite Aids to stock in order to profit? Burt's Bees makes products that are in demand because that's what they're good at. Retailers are good at making those items accessible to buyers, who continue to buy the items they like. There's no need for Burt's to worry about an continuing stream of new distributors, they're profitable because people like their shit, no revenue from a downline is necessary. If MLM's had good products you wouldn't need to be both the retailer and wholesaler. Just sell the products at retail price if you want to profit. Recruiting a downline and allowing others to have access to the same wholesale prices as you makes no sense...you have quality products direct from the manufacturer, you should sell it yourself and not give others access to your connect . Why do you need to be telling people about a business opportunity you have while you're already busy selling high quality goods? That's not how it works at all. Do any of the MLM's make products that industry-leading   There are lawsuits against some of the best-known mlm beauty supplies (Monat, Wen, etc). There's an MLM that sells oils that people....can drink...that's insane and so is giving medical advice to people without any qualifications or data...that's psychotic and the fact you brought up Herbalife, a company known for having worthless products (the supplement industry is a notorious fraud). And you spout off nonsense right-wing conspiracies about ""globalists"" who control everything, so you kind of outed yourself as the typical target to fall for these schemes...antimaskers, antivaccine bored moms from the midwest who use the word sheeple and ""do your own research"". That's the typical mlm shill on social media. Is that you? Get Help",4년 전,72,

@JayP80Geno," @SusieQSydney  the problem isn’t just the product, it’s the structure of the whole company, which is what most of this segment is about in the first place. My ex works for an essential oils business and I was around a lot of the testimonials claiming that the products were capable of some pretty insane things. One being the founder curing his paralysis by using the product. While I agree some of these products are great replacements to ease minor ailments, there is a ton of danger in making false claims that they are cures to very serious conditions.  Crazy product claims aside, the other major problem with mlm’s is building a team underneath each sales person, and the fact that those people must maintain a certain sales average to keep their position and/or move up within the company. This would often require my ex to buy extra product to maintain her level each month. That’s how a lot of these companies make bank, and while it may not be illegal, it’s pretty gross. And much like this segment mentions, the guidelines in which these “entrepreneurs” make money is completely unclear.",4년 전,25,

@SusieQSydney," @JayP80Geno  It's not unclear to those who work Jay sell and build a lot and your remuneration is more greater and more passive not rocket science and guess what harder you work the more FREEBIES YOU GET YEAH like FREE HOLIDAY I got a lot of perks even when I didn't preform when my upline did with her holiday the only time I have ridden in a limo in my awesome especially because I didn't have to pay for it and shared their wealth F yeah the best Holiday has been with Herbalife they sure know how to put on a party!!!   No suprise this is wow coming from another bum who doesn't provide for his Mrs but very willing shit's on her parade and not doubt as to why she's your EX MRS.   It true you will have to work to stay wealthier not exactly an industry secret in saying that I hadn't do volumes for decades and paid my piddle annual fee even they still gave me 35% off you get that for life if you qualify as a supervisor just once. A success company can be generous you think the staffer or even their distributors at HBO get 35% for life on anything HBO products I don't think so. 35% is massive that more then a third an already cheap health solution and health solution are generally not cheap that work.  Passive income or royalty doesn't preclude that set the example while this might be different with celebrities not everyone has talent to preform or willing to give up their privacy to earn a royalty but it's a company in the business of bottom of the jar health solution your heavy lifting is not where near as most other industries I mean how many times are you going to listen to someone byatch about other companies anyways with John Oliver compare to how many time your going to need your good health daily I expect. I try and remember for John to be the multi-millionaire he is other minions had to be fired today to carry his lifestyle you don't fire a Herbalife Independent distributor ever unless they talk to this bastard or really drag their name in the mud though nobody fired me yet so I know they're tolerance for bad behaviour is pretty amazing.  The health it provide would seem insane if you never tested it which clearly like the other bum I was talking to while everybody knows Herbalife for works for weight loss but general health progress and growing younger is a little known and I'm hear to dispel the myth   Happy to demonstrate with empirical testing for FREE come here with your health challenge and I will provide the most fast turn around you'll never get with current provider - so you think scam it couldn't possibly help your tumor or your cancer here try and see if your not making health progress well you don't even need your money back I'm put you on the highest program but clearly with long terms illness it will take longer then a week to see real progress but I'll pay for initially if you pay me back once I deliver for the year or two it might take to see substantial change but I told you I'm alive I have many dead family members it's proof of what I say even younger sibling have more serious help anomalies the youngest of who own her own Pharmacy is aging more rapidly then me.   When I need a quick turn around in health I always get it with Herbalife I can't say that about too many other products whether that be laryngitis, heavy adult psoriasis, wasp sting inflammation over and over these are what I have suffer but not for long due to HERBALIFE THANK YOU HERBALIFE YOUR SIMPLY THE BEST.   I mean the changes are dramatic like in a day sometime for skin based problems if you use enough there's noticeable change Herbalife don't just talk the solutions they have pictures as I do myself your body is infinite ability to heal but that only happen with the right building blocks - these claim are not false give me health problem and I will give you faster turn around much faster then they can get on their own will pay for products for demonstration to be recorded online.  The insanity is that this solution isn't found in very hospital or sold every street corner but I my will be pushing for that as enterprise and government supplier as these solutions work heaps better then any medication my doctors have provide me with little to no side effects usually the side effect unwanted attention you might get looking younger then your age or better looking then your siblings can cause rift amongst families but small price to pay for good health.",4년 전,0,

@Sydewyndre," @SusieQSydney  oh rofl this is a bot. That makes sense, actually. But this is kinda funny, and I got nowhere else to be rn.   So, I actually did check for scholarly articles on Herbalife. There's a couple talking about Herbalife causing liver damage, and one that disputes those findings. So, as far as medical journals are concerned, the absolute BEST you can say for Herbalife is that it does not damage the liver. Very high bar we're working with here, clearly.   My point is that if these products actually did as you claim, they'd make billions more selling directly in shelves instead of through a pyramid scheme. No company with a worthwhile product that it's marketing to the masses would deliberately keep itself OFF the shelves.   Also, this ""we don't claim the product does any of this"" bullshit really doesn't fly. Herbalife drones be like ""Herbalife does not market these as medicines or treatments for anything"" while immediately following that up with ""but I know 37 people who used to have terminal cancer, then they took Herbalife and now they're astronauts in perfect health thanks to the product.""   As for who the fuck I am, I'm just a normal person, mostly unremarkable, and I'm more than smart enough to see through your idiocy.",4년 전,6,

In Spain people are very aggressive they've been know to take the product with nothing to try and make weight loss even faster but that's not the way you take the products when detoxing it's important to do a program the way it's designed not do your own thing with at least one main meal to absorb some of that pre-existing toxins that leches into the blood stream - why don't you tell me something else I don't know but your toxin are better out of your system then in your system.,4년 전,0,

I knew that was bullshit, because unlike the rest of the adults in the room, I know that's because younger people grow nails faster. I decided to wait for a moment to troll the guy.   Later on, we had a session where the facilitator would pretend to be someone who has diabetes and the attendees would try to sell an item from their catalog. Then, came my turn. This is my moment. Mic in hand, I listed not just one or two items like the rest, but I went through the whole catalog and mentioned every item that claimed to help with diabetes and added my own layer of bullshit including ""protection from radiation"".

@tylerwright3207,"Mary Kay has something called a ""Husband Unawareness Plan"" which is where they will heavily pressure women to hide how much they are spending on the product.

They will also even send a special invoice with the product saying ""congratulations on winning the contest"" so that the husband thinks that his wife hasn't spent any money at all. Of course Mary Kay consultants act like lying to your spouse about spending thousands of dollars is adorable and funny and ""just between us girls"" but lying about Mary Kay spending is quoted in an alarming number of divorces. There are whole websites dedicated to stories about the ""Husband Unawareness Plan"" and while Mary Kay consistently tries to claim that it's not a real thing and that if it does happen it's just the act of a couple of rogue consultants it's just too widespread for that to be true. Plus people have legit literature from their uplines about it. They actively encourage this fraud.",4년 전,1,

@rhettyd,I tried XFT and it did not work for me so I refused to sell it. I eventually noticed that they were pushing more of a business model and success than a product. I am a product person and my feeling about a product is that if it is good you can afford to give it away because people will burst down your door to buy it from you after they see the results. Some products will be different I suppose but XFT is supposed to improve fuel consumption. That would sell like addictive drugs if it worked. Unless my market does not have the fuel issues it claims to treat it is a fake product. I also would warn people about Doug Ckark Real Estate.,4년 전,0,

@jasonchui6226,"Well spoken, I really i loved the way he talked in details that's the most interesting part i really love that idea. But he should have just expanciated more on highlighting the citizens have a great knowledge on investing and trading. Cause as a human begin, Making money should be your main priority and number aim in life. Honestly at my early stage of life as when i just got married, Making money was so tough for i and wife cause i lost my job and i wasn't able to satisfy my wife needs anymore. She later made her way by running, and leaving three tenders kids behind. It was so terrible if i may say cause i had to hustle up by cleaning the streets so i could put food on the table for my kids and had to also shelter and cloth them. Early these year before the covid19 out break, I went for a church seminar which i saw on a platform so decided to go. Unknowingly the guest of honor was a woman named Mrs Lyra Holt Dean which i have been hearing for about 7 years now. She talked about Blockchain and Forex which i have always kept saying it is scam and forever it is. So as time went on, i kept on hearing testimony about this same woman how she has made a lot of people rich. As time went on the covid19 issue became serious that the Government had to put the whole country on a total lockdown. Things became more worst cause there was no cashflow due to the governments lockdown, Then i gained interest and decided to sacrifice with a very little amount cause i didn't have much. I reached her at contact@lyraholtdean. com  Truly speaking just that first investment made me a very wealthy man and also got me a well nice positioned crib and a brand new car .I was so grateful cause that impacted a lot into my life, I became a very happy man by making a facial smile for my beloved kid. So anywhere i go i feel so glad telling people my story and also getting my fellow citizens motivated.",4년 전,0,

The whole time i sat there it felt like a crazy cult or crazy religious convention. This speaker came on and started saying bullshit on how you would live in a huge fancy house, drive a nice car and make alot of money. After it all ended they took us with a recruiter to this small office and ""interviewed"" us on what we thought and ""explained"" how if i signed up people i knew to get insurance from them then they would sign up another group and then it keeps going. I am so happy i saw through all the shit and never signed up. Another time i was sitting at starbucks with my mom and i ended up sitting next to some guy talking to a younger guy about how he dresses nice and showing him the car he drives, he then proceeded to use a death he recently experienced to say to him ""who do you think they will remember more the guy that brings flowers or the guy that gives a thousand dollar check to the family.

But he should have just expanciated more on highlighting the citizens have a great knowledge on investing and trading. Cause as a human begin, Making money should be your main priority and number aim in life. Honestly at my early stage of life as when i just got married, Making money was so tough for i and wife cause i lost my job and i wasn't able to satisfy my wife needs anymore. She later made her way by running, and leaving three tenders kids behind. It was so terrible if i may say cause i had to hustle up by cleaning the streets so i could put food on the table for my kids and had to also shelter and cloth them. Early these year before the covid19 out break, I went for a church seminar which i saw on a platform so decided to go. Unknowingly the guest of honor was a woman named Mrs Lyra Holt Dean which i have been hearing for about 7 years now. She talked about Blockchain and Forex which i have always kept saying it is scam and forever it is. So as time went on, i kept on hearing testimony about this same woman how she has made a lot of people rich. As time went on the covid19 issue became serious that the Government had to put the whole country on a total lockdown. Things became more worst cause there was no cashflow due to the governments lockdown, Then i gained interest and decided to sacrifice with a very little amount cause i didn't have much. I reached her at contact@lyraholtdean. com Truly speaking just that first investment made me a very wealthy man and also got me a well nice positioned crib and a brand new car .I was so grateful cause that impacted a lot into my life, I became a very happy man by making a facial smile for my beloved kid. So anywhere i go i feel so glad telling people my story and also getting my fellow citizens motivated.",4년 전,177,

Somehow, I got to be a part of the audience.  At one point, the facilitator said ""Kids today are exposed to too much radiation from tech, you can tell by how the white spots on their nails are bigger compared to adults"". I knew that was bullshit, because unlike the rest of the adults in the room, I know that's because younger people grow nails faster. I decided to wait for a moment to troll the guy.   Later on, we had a session where the facilitator would pretend to be someone who has diabetes and the attendees would try to sell an item from their catalog. Then, came my turn. This is my moment. Mic in hand, I listed not just one or two items like the rest, but I went through the whole catalog and mentioned every item that claimed to help with diabetes and added my own layer of bullshit including ""protection from radiation"". It made the guy very uneasy and I was getting 'the look' from everyone else in the room except my mom, who conveniently was in the bathroom at the time. It was glorious.

Let’s take an exemple of someone opening her restaurant. She will have to be first, the customer of people like a restaurant seller maybe, then she’ll have to buy everything that’s needed to be in there, then she becomes the customer of each and every type of seller. Then once she starts to make money with her she still stays a customer as for the food and everything else that’s needed in the restaurant stocks but also if she gains a good amount of money she’ll still continue buying things to herself.  So tying to discredit MLM by saying your a customer because you had to buy stuff, doesn’t work out. Because actually hey it’s how all the economy work.

@ayzadiaz," @TheRach995  interesting, it’s actually very different from what I’ve experienced. They actually never gave me any false promises and they said it only works if I work for it and if I want it bad enough, which I completely agree with, not just applying to Primerica but for anything in general. The only thing is that I don’t like the pushiness which is something I am trying to change, I genuinely would love to help my friends and family, if I believe it’s for a good cause I would want to let them know about it. If it was a “product” I was selling, then yes it would be a little different and it would feel very unethical to me, but having life ins/investing in retirement accounts etc. would be a wise thing to do and I would love for my loved ones to at least have some sort of financial knowledge and learn how to manage their finances because most people in America do not know how to which is why most of us are broke. I dislike being pushy and I really am not one to bother people at all, like I don’t even ask ppl for help ever. But if I think it’s something that will help then I will try to make my family and friends aware at least once because all I want to do as long as I’m living, is help people, if I get money cool but like my main focus is helping others, at least help someone learn something new would be very important to me. From what I’ve experienced it truly was life changing. I am not one who is that attracted to money if it is boasted, I just care about spreading a message and when I went to one of the conventions they were holding it really did make me feel something in my heart. So many people sharing their stories, and these are mostly people of foreign countries, they shared their story of how they made it to the top and it just lit a spark within me. Seeing people on the stage crying, realizing they’ve achieved their dreams, that feeling of being special, being somebody; it is truly something heart touching and honeslty it’s made me cry multiple times. That experience, the people, the environment, the support…it was worth way more than anything I could ever pay for. It is a rare thing and I’ve never experienced that at a normal “job” and never will. So for me, I don’t care about being broke, I don’t care about being rich, I don’t care if I die.

No one wants to take responsibility for their lives and to me it’s heart breaking to determine your worth on a paycheck, nobody deserves to be treated like their life is worth is a simple x per hour. I’ve personally seen these people work for it, and make it. That’s all it took. I’ve known about it since I was a child so I knew some people but I didn’t get in and I didn’t know what it was, I wanted to learn more about it which is why I joined and I just wanted to dip my toes in to see how it was. Something that I’ve recently learned and applied, was this phrase “you are who you hang around.” Although these are success stories, and maybe just maybe if they got “lucky,” I know there is something I must learn from them.

And while if you get in very early and are at the top tier of their pyramid, you will likely make a lot of money. That is an if, but a necessary one--and almost impossible to acheive.

I just threw that in there because, inevitably, you'd have pinned me as someone who follows [insert thing here you say is bad], and I wanted to get ahead of the curb.  Also, uh, fuck you? I'll say whatever the hell I want, because it's a public discussion. If you don't like it, you can always stop engaging in it.",4년 전,1,
@GeoPePeTto," @AlwaysANemesis   that’s not what biased means, that’s the result of being biased. If I say I hate pumpkins it means I’m biased against pumpkins because I hate them or because i don’t like the taste?      So you just told me you’re agnostic because you already made your mind about me and knew exactly what I was gonna say. That’s pretty arrogant of you.     Ofc you can say whatever you want. But at least offer some explanation. You just assumed some things about me. At least tell me how can you be in-biased against religion and still say it’s shit. Maybe it’s my fault because I generalized, ofc not all of them were made for the sole purpose of warmongering and control like the Abrahamic ones, but the problem with most of them is dogma. They were usually invented a long time ago when we had low standards of morality and they cannot be changed, because it’s the holy word of some kind of god.

@ducktail4068,"Before anyone starts bashing on Amway let me educate you. You need $75 to get a license to buy the products at an IBO price (not retail price) and to legally sell their stuff.  If you decide selling is not for you, Amway will REFUND YOUR MONEY ($75 you paid). Pyramid schemes WILL NEVER EVER refund your money. A pyramid scheme makes money from people paying to join and will not give back their only source of income.   Pyramid schemes also never make money from selling their products. They have low quality cheap products that are difficult to sell. The point of the Pyramid scheme was never to sell products its to sell memberships at HIGH PRICES. Amway on the other hand only makes money from REAL SALES of their products.   Recruiting people does not make you money. You selling and the people you have recruited selling products is the way you and Amway make money. Just like any other business, they sell products and they have franchisees with their own locations selling the same products. Amway IS THE SAME except it doesn't have locations, it has PEOPLE.  A pyramid scheme makes you charge people large sums of money which you give a certain percentage back to the company while you keep the rest. It encourages you to have others do the same. Amway is not like that. Amway you pay the $75 for the license directly to Amway. IBOs do not make money recruiting people. Once again, they make money the legitimate way: by selling products.  Pyramid schemes also MAKE YOU buy a certain amount of products to even join. They may make you buy as much as $600 worth of their garbage and then you will be allowed to join.   Amway DOES NOT DO THAT.  All you need is the IBO license and that's it. You can buy as little or as much as you want OR you don't even need to BUY ANYTHING AT ALL. You can set up an official website with them and have your customers buy directly from said website and Amway will package and ship the product FOR YOU AND SEND IT DIRECTLY TO YOUR CUSTOMERS.  Amway makes BILLIONS a year and have been successful for many years. Pyramid schemes always fall apart sooner or later. Amway will never die because it's a legitimate business with legitimate high quality products.",5년 전,0,
@mariamloius5629,"Are You Heartbroken? Don’t be upset, let Dr.sea help you get your Ex back” I was married for 5 years with 2 kids and i have been living happily with my family until things started getting ugly with me and my husband that leads us to fights and arguments almost every time… it got worse at a point that my husband filed for divorce I tried my best to make him change his mind & stay with me cause i loved him with all my heart and didn’t want to loose my husband but everything just didn’t work out.  He moved out of the house and still went ahead to file for divorce I pleaded and tried everything but still nothing worked. The breakthrough came when someone introduced me to this wonderful, great spell caster called Dr.sea Who eventually helped me out.  I have never been a fan of things like this but just decided to try it because I was desperate and left with no choice.  He did the spell for me and things really work out as he promise and my husband have a change of mind and come back home to stay with me and the kids. And promise never to hurt me again. we are living happily as it was with the help of Dr.sea If you are in need of help you can contact Dr.sea   via email: spellcastercenter453@gmail. com or   WhatsApp him: +2349051727486   Instagram page @Dr.sea1 never fails",5년 전,0,

The more people you have under you, the more money you make."" The more they talked, the more alarmed i became, realizing how close i had been to signing up for a pyramid scheme/MLM.

@theofficialkingmidas,"What you know equally.  Wells fargo showed my account balance $3 trillion. Since I showed it this was in the bank by sunny hills . Withdrew $500 million . Told teller bankers etc . Was at usc was a bank card. Highest security.  This is in USA alone.  Other accounts chase morgan chase $3 billion. Others in usa. Now to give u the numbers how the balance got to that amount.  Ebay amazon etsy others etc got to top 5 in all affiliate sales based websites . Bought worldwide resell for profit examples bought 200 units resold for $5 each .  Sold the same other websites . The results were all $50k monthly to as much as $100 million this is selling in many countries . So the income generated adds up got into sales got into network marketing got to the top of all companies got the sales to as much as $500 million worldwide. So you get your %🤯 depending on your company I remember I wanted to dwarf even the founders too. This got easy when I recruited professionals or experience ppl. That adds another $5 million to as much as $75 million monthly. So do the math all the websites at $100 m recurring always getting referrals teams etc. Index funds, roth ira, 401k,etc  invested in 777 companies about $10 million each x 777 . Famous examples are $5 billion in Putin's company and tesla. Russian whatever is making money . I did this in 30 countries even poor countries to sustain their water eco systems according to bill gates . Leonardo dicaprio 2 followers and mentors. Funny thing is black panther came out and showed the world a great return.   In water etc. Also got into inventions all copyrighted patented etc. Mainly on helping thriving businesses or businesses facing bankrupty I show them what god told me.and guess what? Their in fortune 100 Forbes etc and best of all make u even more rich or famous .  The world buys even more or makes u even richer. So on. So everything that comes outta me pretty much think about it? Is all copyrighted and patented who's using it?  Pharmacies, supplement companies, agencies, companies . So examples got a Approval for a product licensed etc my rights get bought it gets evaluated potential etc quick $1 million boom invest more business etc . I remember even my rich smart friends I retired where scared of their own cheesecake cakes etc. They would say sang 100 flavors that don't exist into a cheesecake factory ' niche' or new internet company .

My dad started in the early 90's here in Greece, and since the 00's we're in a pretty great financial state ngl. What I've seen from the hb seminars and my dad's advice is that hb isn't for everyone for sure, and he advices new members to be careful with buying products in bulk. I can't speak objectively, I've grown up only with people who have succeeded, and some who stopped selling but continued to consume products, like my mum and uncle.  Tbh I don't think i'll stop consuming the products 'cause they've helped me balance my diet a lot (and the recent shakes go so well with oat milk ahh). I dislike tho the fact that hb is a huge company, and as in every huge company, it profits off of its employees' loss.

@GalliadII,"there is money to be made in this stuff. my family has been involved in several mlms for the last 10 years. and there are a few things you can look out for to avoid or at least minimalize the chance of loss. always look for a system that has existed for less than a year and that allows you to make your money back in 4-6 months without doing anything. also avoid systems that are growing too slowly. there is a sweet spot. if it grows faster, it is younger. but if it slows down, it will soon collapse.  but never ever sell physical products. this is a red line, nobody should cross. sell crypto currencies, sell digital goods, fine. but never ever buy anything to sell it. if you do, you will never achieve the freedom you want.  other red flags consist of fixed number of partners, low return of investment, the use of the word family, big promises in general, and flashy shows in general. but those alone are not a sign of something dangerous. also never recruit friends and family, only strangers. because you do not want to poison your home with it. no matter how awesome it seams. if someone asks you what you are doing, tell them, but also warn them. if they still want it, give them. but never convince them. this way it is not your fault when they loose anything.  hope this helps. and no, I am not sabotaging my family with this post. we operate far far away from herbalife. fuck herbalife.",5년 전,0,

@alexandravar.3661,"The day has come! I had a very pleasant conversation with my dad, I hopefully understood correctly and I can simply put my thoughts in words. So where do I start.. First of all, all the allegations from members and distributors that the products cure illnesses etc, are just personal experiences, not the company's claims. (except that career book included in the video which the company removed bc of the fancy claims made when the company first launched ).  My dad had an ulcer in the small intestine since birth and it disappeared after using the products. He says that to people as an experience not as a way to pursue them that the x product will cure y illness. Then about the people that bought products in bulk wasting money, well, your supervisor should help you get started with the sales, but some supervisors make new members and leave them figure it out on their own, which doesn't work out. When u first start selling you buy a few products, and when these are sold, u buy more. As for the pyramid scheme title, a man named Bill Ackman spent $50 million on a public relations campaign against Herbalife, which was designed to hurt the company's stock price, that's why he said the company owed him money. Here is the link to the wikipedia page for anyone who's interested. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Ackman#Herbalife_short  I mean, this job is not for everyone. I've told my dad that I can't be anything besides a consumer because I have other goals away from that sales thingy. It's okay. Other than that, I can see where most of the comments' points come from but it's not that big of a deal.. If u want to try it, okay,  just do your research for any MLM to be safe.

@rossdaboss1959,"Isaiah 53:5, But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes, we are healed.For salvation, people just need to follow the way they did it in Acts? They were baptized in the water and of the spirit. Here's why! The gospel is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. If we are to follow him, we must do the same thing. Death= repentance, Burial = baptism, and resurrection = being filled with the Holy Ghost and rising again from the dead. That's what Acts 2:38 is.We must obey the gospel, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that OBEY NOT THE GOSPEL of our Lord Jesus Christ... Matthew 7:21-23, Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that DOETH THE WILL OF MY FATHER which is in Heaven. St John 3:3-5, EXCEPT a man be born of WATER AND OF THE SPIRIT, he cannot enter into the kingdom of GOD.We can't come up with our own gospel. Galatians 1:8-9, But though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. Don't be cursed. One way for all people. Jews, Gentiles, and Samaritan. Our salvation has to match-up with the scriptures and no scriptures on the subject can be taken away.Eternity is TOOO long to be WRONG! st, John 5:39, Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.God told Noah exactly how to be saved, how he must build the ark. Noah didn't come up with his own plan like people are doing today. A sinner's prayer, you just have to believe, etc which is not in the bible.The gospels show what Christ has done on the cross for us. The book of Acts shows us the beginning of Christ's Church and how to enter the Church, obeying Acts 2:38. The letters were written to the Church to show us how to behave now that we are born again into the Church.It's better to walk alone than to walk with a crowd going in the wrong direction. Are we supposed to follow the teachings of the apostles? Acts 2:42, They continued steadfastly in the apostle's doctrines. Ephesians 2:20, We are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone. If you believe in this message, help spread it in the name of Jesus Christ. God bless you!",5년 전,0,

@frankguinan9927,"“Within thirteen cycles, you run out of people...” I did the math on a basic calculator app on my iPhone, and the result is 6,103,516,000 (rounded up to the nearest thousand because of the mathematical limitations of the app); this is less than the population of the earth. According to Google, the population of the earth in 2016 was 7,426,000,000 (rounded to the nearest million people). I know I’m being a stickler, and it’s a good point, but technically, it would actually take 14 cycles (5 to the 15th power) to exceed the population of the earth, which ends up amounting to: 30.5176 billion, rounded up to the nearest 100 thousand, again due to the mathematical imprecision of the app I used to calculate this. Try it yourself: 5x5=25, x5=125, x5= 625, etc.... (that is how you want to type it in, using the keys I typed in). If you have a better calculator, you can just type in 5^13, 5^14, and 5^15; and you’ll get the exact same results, but possibly with a higher precision, especially with say: a TI-83 or similar calculator. Yes, I’m kind of a math nerd, I get it.... I’m just saying that adding a single digit to the exponent would have absolutely accurate. But the way it’s explained isn’t correct because over 6 billion isn’t exactly “exceeding the population of the earth”. It’s close, but it’s not actually exceeding the population of the earth, technically. But the next step very much WOULD, FAAAAR exceeding the population of the earth by many times. Aren’t exponential equations fun, kiddos??? Just kidding, they’re not that fun. But I’m right, so..... just buy a calculator and do the actual math before making an erroneous statement. It’s not that hard. I’m kind of drunk right now, and I did it. By the way, MLMs are TERRIBLE! My sister conned me into one, and I was charged about $38 a month to buy the basic package for over a year. I didn’t really use much of what I bought. It was a basic package to continue membership. And NO ONE wanted in on it (including me), so I basically wasted over $400 on useless crap in the meantime, while trying to convince friends that it was “a tringle-shaped opportunity”. Take his advice and stay away from these scamming assholes! Side note: used car salesmen and saleswomen use a similar strategy. I was told on several occasions over 35 years of living: “We have to cover our overhead, and the internet has taken over, so we want your car, but.... it’s not in PERFECT condition [I’m referring to the sale of several cars WELL under 80,000 miles here], so we will offer you x amount.” And that amount was SIGNIFICANTLY lower than the blue book value because “Kelly Blue Book is unreliable are best, and it doesn’t take into account [our overhead] the ‘fact’ that we will likely sell your car at auction. We don’t get as much at auction because we don’t typically sell your brand of car.” Now, some people may say: “Why not go to a BMW dealership to sell a 2005 BMW M3, and then get more money???” Well, I tried that, and I was told the same thing. I guess my point here is that salesmen aren’t particular skilled, and they lie and cheat their way into trying to get people to both pay sticker price for a new car and also into taking less than the Kelly Blue Book value for a used car, while also touting ideas like leases... and although some rich people lease brand new cars every couple of years, they don’t realize that one way or another, they are paying for the depreciation of said car... they look at the deal and say: “Hey, the payments are lower than owning!” But the fact is that the depreciation is coming out of their pocket, and for a new German car, that depreciation can be anywhere between $20,000-40,000 OR MORE over the lease period; PLUS they have to return the car to the dealer without having any ownership at all. I have NEVER leased a car, never mind a new one, in my ENTIRE life. I have financed to own several cars, but in the process of trading said cars in, I am offered THOUSANDS less than the car is worth on Kelly Blue Book, no matter what. I even once got a cash offer from Kelly Blue Book for $18,000, only to turn up at their approved dealership, then offered $14,000, which then went down to $12,000 a few days later because “they thought about it and decided they didn’t really want my old Subaru.” Anyway, at $12,000-18,000, it was a REALLY nice Subaru with less than 40,000 miles, and they were sticklers about EVERYTHING! I guess my point is that MLMs are like ALL salesmen and saleswomen.... they are ALL con artists, and SHAME ON THEM for making money by LYING for a living... that’s what Donald J. Chump does, and it hasn’t worked out that great for him either... SURE, he made A LOT of money by lying and defrauding MANY people, but how does he sleep at night??? I’m MUCH more content in a job that doesn’t involve any dishonesty, while I know I would be MORE than qualified to sell used cars or MLM products, thereby lying and securing a special place in hell by feeding my family as a professional ASSHOLE! One car salesman actually asked me if I wanted to buy any cocaine! (my “friend” at the time was missing a couple of teeth, and I shouldn’t have brought him along for a test drive at an Audi dealership on Cape Cod.... I’m just sayin’...) True story though! OF COURSE an Audi salesman on CAPE COD thought I wanted cocaine.... that’d the kind of people that work in this industry.... drug addicts and cheats and liars and ALL OF THE ABOVE!!!! Side note: I don’t do cocaine, and I NEVER have.... but this idiot I felt bad for and used to hang out with actually did at times, and the used car salesman saw this from a MILE away! I should have too, and I probably wouldn’t have talked to the prick to begin with.... I digress.... but ANY good salesman has ONE trait in common: “Business Ethics??? WTF IS THAT?!????” I had another friend who worked at Sears, and he was their TOP TV salesman... however, he was honest with customers and told them: “you don’t really NEED to buy the extended warranty, it’s a scam!” He had repeat customers that specifically requested him because he was honest and well-meaning.... However, he was soon demoted to stocking shelves because he didn’t sell enough of these bogus warranties! Anyone who’s bought one of these “warranties” knows that when you go to return the product, there are MANY stipulations, and basically.... they won’t honor the “warranty” in about 99.9999999% of cases.... salesmen, you’re ALL ASSHOLES!",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@ideitbawxproductions1880,"heh, I remember Primerica... got roped into it by a fairweather friend (pretty sure he just wanted the money so he could keep doing coke). Met a couple of decent people, but that was about it. No-one we knew wanted to buy any of their life insurance/investment products, and I gave up after my buddy went into a rage over it.  Only 1 good thing I can say about Primerica: they would at least do an assessment to see if changing your current insurance would actually save you money, and if it didn't, we wouldn't force you to do anything; we just shake your hand, thank you for your time, and walk away.  Doesn't mean it wasn't a pyramid scheme, though :P",4년 전,1,
@ElisabethGaffney," @Tommy10048  reps do recruit people though. Their friends, mostly. Then they make money off their own “recruits.” I did Cutco for a while and that’s exactly how it was. Maybe it wasn’t an MLM when you were in college but it definitely is now",3년 전,0,

However, I was a college student, I didn't really know much about knives nor how CUTCOs would perform, so  I ended up calling them the same night and letting them know I wasn't going to do it.",3년 전,1,

You buy products from the company, you're paying a subscription fee every month in order to qualify for 'cashback' (the commission you make from downlines), the more you buy the cheaper it is, they give you over-valued incentives and prizes, you get a progressively higher discount the more other 'customers' you sign up.  Those deals where you get $25 each of credit on Ubereats, or $100 each of free power if you sign a friend up to your power company, is a BETTER WAY OF MAKING MONEY.",5년 전,0,
