While the illegitimate email originated from an FBI operated server, that server was dedicated to pushing notifications for LEEP and was not part of the FBI’s corporate email service. No actor was able to access or compromise any data or PII on the FBI’s network. Once we learned of the incident, we quickly remediated the software vulnerability, warned partners to disregard the fake emails, and confirmed the integrity of our networks.",3년 전,0,

If you look for other sources you come across things like: Mexico Juan Méndez, a street vendor in Chihuahua, Mexico, invented the burrito. During the Mexican Revolution in the 1910s, Méndez decided to wrap his food in flour tortillas to keep it warm and transport it on his small donkey.

USA? Burritos are more common in the north of Mexico that's why USA got the chance of having them.

My country is the United States *of America*, so therefore we are America.   Actually no that’s a false equivalence because Europe is a continent, and America is referred to as a country. Big difference. Canadians, Mexicans, Argentinians are not Americans, they are Canadians, Mexicans and Argentinians or North and South Americans. Calling a Canadian an American is like calling a Japanese person German, you are essentially erasing our nationality because we are not “United Statian”.

Its been called America FOR CENTURIES before USA was created, so don´t tell me that i´m spreading misinformation, maybe read a history book or ask someone out of the States, cause let's be real, half of USA americans still belive Spain is in Mexico so I guess geography is not one of their strenghts",4년 전,6,

@ines.898," @PerishingPurplePulsar  Apparently it is. There is no other world in English to refer  to them. And each country teaches the continents different apparently. But people from south America do consider themselves Americans. I've had a lot of trouble when I have referred to people from USA as Americans because Latin americans do get offended. I'm from Spain and I've always been told America is a continent. We do have a word to call people from USA, we call them ""estadounidenses"" instead of ""americanos"" cause we do consider America as a continent, even if you divide it in North and South America is still America for us and many other countries which are educated this way",4년 전,6,

@PerishingPurplePulsar," @noahk9204  As a kid I took shots of vinegar, so I can't relate",4년 전,2,
@PerishingPurplePulsar," @noahk9204  Pure white Vinegar, straight. I know it was hella bad for me but there is something about the taste, I love it. Now I just mix some Apple Cider Vinegar with honey and tea now so sate my longing without putting a hole in my stomach",4년 전,2,
@PerishingPurplePulsar," @noahk9204  False, first off, Vinegar has no percentage aside from acetic acid content, of which your average pure white vinegar that you can get from the store averages out to 5-20% acetic acid. Trust me, I should know, I have an unhealthy obsession with it",4년 전,0,
@PerishingPurplePulsar," @noahk9204  1% Vinegar isn't dangerous, but large or long enough exposure to even distilled vinegar (which is more about taste and has almost the same 5-20% acetic acid content) can be dangerous",4년 전,0,
@PerishingPurplePulsar," @noahk9204  I did drink pure vinegar, what I did not drink was pure Acetic Acid, there is a vast difference. Pure White Vinegar isn't in reference to other vinegar being less vinegary, it refers to flavour and is like the difference between bleached and unbleached flower otherwise. All it takes is a tiny bit of research dude, it really isn't that hard to figure it out. You claim I ""Didn't drink 100% Vinegar"" and that ""Stores sell max 1%"". Even if we assume you mistook the percentage of vinegar for acetic acid percentage, you are wrong, Vinegar is sold at much higher rates than 1%, and is never less than 100% vinegar. It's like if I said you weren't drinking 100% water because it only contains 1% Hydrogen, even if my percentage is right(It's not incase you can't tell) I am still wrong because Hydrogen is one part of water as a whole. Do you understand or do I have to use my explain this to a 4 year old skills?",4년 전,0,
@PerishingPurplePulsar," @noahk9204  Vinegar is defined as an aqueous solution of acetic acid, and percentage labelling of vinegar refers to the content of acetic acid. No matter what vinegar you have, or what acetic acid percent it has, it is and always will be 100% vinegar. You are fundamentally incorrect dude, If you are a doctor you should understand this fine. It is basic kindergarten science and maths. I refuse to agree to disagree because you are factually incorrect, and you were the one who brought up the false facts trying to sound all high and mighty.

@phil385," @ajfischer6540  Well actually Burgers aren't german. The reason it's called a hamburger is that it uses/used a hamburg steak in the dish. There has of course been a lot of changes since then (The meat was once served raw, believe it or not). The whole idea behind putting it in between two buns, was actually so that people could eat them at the stadiums, that were popping up around the nation at that time. It actually has a much more similar history to the hotdog than most people realize. Sure it may have been made by German people, But it was made in America, by immigrants who perceived themselves as American. Besides, the modern image of a hamburger has almost nothing to do with its historical food ancestors in Germany, so I think it's wrong to call it german. PS I'm not American, so don't try to say that I'm only saying this stuff because I'm American. Cheers!",5년 전,1,

If so, take this test to see for sure.  Have you ever lied, stolen, used the Lords name in vain, Looked at a woman or guy with lust, have you hated someone? If you have done any of these or any of the 10 commandments that I haven't mentioned, you are NOT a good person and you are in serious danger of Judgement Day. If you died today, would you be innocent or guilty by Gods standard, which is moral perfection?,.... 100% guilty is the answer, and your punishment would very likely be eternal damnation in Hell because the one to whom you have sinned against is eternal, which means he requires eternal justice for sins.  (iv said this not to be offensive...but because i care about you deeply and i want you to have eternal life in Jesus Christ...  (:  )  However....there is something you can do and should do to be saved, you MUST TRUST IN CHRIST AND REPENT OF YOUR SINS and he is faithful and just to forgive you of your sins and to cleanse you from all unrighteousness  Jesus Christ died on that cross to make the payment for your sins so God could LEGALLY COMMUTE your DEATH SENTENCE as well as mine and every other person on the face of the earth  PLEASE think about what im saying, this will be the most important decision of you life.

@perrinromney4555,"Y'all forgetting that a political border is not a cultural border. Southern Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona share many cultural traits of the Northern Mexican regions they border. It's hard to say where the burrito is from, but we know that it was probably a thing long before that border was there. [The United States of] America has adopted the burrito from its own southern region as part of a diverse national food identity, but that does not prevent it from being part of the Mexican food identity as well. That being said, Mexicans are probably more likely to identify the Tamale as a unique cultural food (although variations are found throughout Central America, a region primarily located in North America).",5년 전,5,

@Albanez39," @kylefast9650  Both slander and defamation only apply when accusations have been made publicly. Defamation requires a heavy accusation, like of having committed a serious crime...slander is less serious and is often used as a tool to pressure your critics into shutting up...but it still demand some form of accusation. You can't get sued for making fun of someone, there must be some form of name calling.     e.g. It's called slander when you accuse someone of being gay. It's defamation when you accuse someone of murder, or fraud, or corruption etc. But as you said, difficult to get charged with such ""crimes"" in the US. I just hope Americans won't offend and accuse people when travelling abroad... you could get imprisoned for 2 years in Germany if you use the Nazi salute or make any form of racist and anti-semitic comment.",5년 전,1,

@real_lampcap, @Albanez39  Wait. So...what are you?,5년 전,0,
@Albanez39," @real_lampcap  I'm half Albanian and half Italian. Living in Tirana, Albania's capital. It's a small country with a shitty economy and corrupted politicians. I personally call it ""Little America"" because the mindset and general behaviour of the people is very similar to the Americans I've come to know through the internet, media and a few people personally.   I guess you're curious to know about my ""hate"" towards the US and its people. First of all, I'd like to say that I don't hate Americans, I hate their country (government) and the economic system they helped establish and promote: Capitalism. The US government has been brainwashing its people for over a century now and you can clearly see the results. Some of the most despicable traits in the American people are pride and glory, nationalism and ignorance, their naive trust and love for their crooked and malevolent government.   In short, the game is rigged. There's no American Dream; it's a lie that Americans and many other foreigners have believed for decades and has allowed them to help increase the wealth of the already established elite. The entire continent was built through the extermination of one ""race"" and the enslavement of another. America is the living proof that the wealthy will always win, and the meaner you are, the more ""success"" you'll have in life. Be an apathetic asshole, ready to fuck and betray anyone you can exploit for your own gain, and you'll be rich and powerful in no time. And everyone seems to desire such a personality and lifestyle, people strive to be rich instead of trying to be compassionate and caring and kind. This is the reason why the world keeps going awry.   Conclusively, everything is ""backwards"" in America. Many things are perceived and learned the wrong way, if not the opposite way. Starting with the most simple things, like the Imperial system (inches, pounds, gallons) when the entire world has shifted to a more efficient measuring system...and to the most complicated things, like political and philosophical theories/ideas; In America, people look at the left and right in a contorted way, not realizing that the politicians and elites have switched things around to make them more confusing and seize ideas and concepts without being labeled in ways they don't like. And lately, such contortions have been spreading in Europe and elsewhere. Racist and fascist politicians have started gaining power all over the world, claiming to be ""populists"", while spreading hate towards immigrants, minorities and everything that is different from them and their sick morals. This is a direct result of the Republican's party 50 year long brainwashing campaign. Since the years of Nixon's power, Republicans have striven to oppress their opponents and transform the country into a trend setting super power. You might want to read about the War on Drugs, and how these fascist leaders were able to imprison thousands of African Americans and strip their right to vote. All for a small joint that is nowadays legal or tolerated nationwide.   What about their international efforts to undermine Democracy? The War on Terror and countless other campaigns in the past have never been towards the greater good. They were accurately planned attacks against governments and people that could make a change and ruin America's greater plan: Dominate the world, economically and politically. Read about Salvador Allende, the democratically elected politician of Chile that was eliminated and replaced by a fascist dictator (Augusto Pinochet), all by parties that were directly funded, trained and supported by the US government. The same happened with Mosadegh in Iran; the US took him down and replaced him with the Shah, a puppet installed to facilitate petroleum (gas) trade in the Middle East. And so on and so forth, the Contras in Nacaragua, Manuel Noriega in Panama, Goulart in Brazil, Suharto in Indonesia etc.   In most of these South American nations, the CIA was supporting local mafias and buying huge amounts of cocaine which then proceeded to sell in America. They didn't just suppress ""communist"" and socialist movements and politicians, they killed and captured anyone that had a leftist background and belief. While the American people lived in this peaceful ""democracy"", their government was installing dictators and supporting their purges and genocides.   I'll live a link where you can read yourself about these regimes the US funded and helped, how they organized coups and destroyed true democracy in dozens of nations. Everything after the 1960' is worth reading and will clearly explain America's intentions for small, developing countries around the world: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change#1960s  Ultimately, I'd like to say something about the Muslim terrorists we're so scared about nowadays. During the Cold War, most of the Middle East and Muslim Asian countries were socialist. Many were democratic and held regular elections, but others had autocratic leaders. But no matter how free they were, they all supported the USSR and China. The three main wars during this time were proxy wars between the US and USSR: North Korea was funded and trained by the USSR, and was fighting against South Korean and American troops. The same happened with North Vietnam and South Vietnam. But Afghanistan was different. In the 80' the USSR invaded Afghanistan and the US responded by training the Mujahideen and supplying them with weapons of all sorts. The US and USSR never fought against each other, but indirectly against each other's allies.  The Mujahideen were tribal fighters in Afghanistan. Good people trying to defend their country against a foreign invader. One of these fighters was called Osama Bin Laden; he was trained by the CIA, and America (probably unknowingly) was funding his future organization. This happened in most other Middle Eastern countries as well, but only Afghanistan fought a war and made the news. All over the area, the US was funding Muslim militias that were fighting against their socialist government to seize power. Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Jordan, Egypt, Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan and others in Asia and Africa turned from free and liberal societies to conservative and extremist Muslim governments that oppress women and gays, while spreading a lot more hate than before towards the US and the Western world.   But this wasn't a good plan gone wrong...America was creating the next big threat after the ""communists"", because a scared society obeys to the ones in power, and tolerates everything as long as they're safe. We were all tricked by the powerful, they want us dumb, they want us ignorant, they want us to live a mediocre life, working like slaves to earn enough money for food and bills. This is modern slavery, we think we're free, but it's just an illusion. We are just free to starve, and if we don't want to, we have to work our asses off our entire lives to make the rich richer.

When I went to mexico, every restaurant we went to always had these two, almost all Mexicans eat tacos and burritos because it's food from our culture. We usually ate pizza, burritos, tacos, sopes, huevos, sopa/caldo, crema con tortillas and chilaquiles. The burritos from America are different from mexican burritos, american style burritos are made with beans, rice, lettuce, cheese and stuff like that but Mexican style burritos have avocado, sour cream, lettuce, tomato, carne asada and more. Americans don't put salsa verde or roja in their bean burritos.",6년 전,1,

@living-undead,"@Bea r Uh. Sombreros are from Mexico right? If ""yes"" then, yeah. I'm saying they're American. North American 😂 Seems like I can't make a joke about logistics and technicalities without being taken literally so I'm gonna say it now and dump it since I've been in this thread for a full month now and kinda wanna leave. I've technically already said my stance but I'll say it again for anyone who doesn't know how to read and responds immediately after seeing one random point without even thinking critically. Mexico is a country in North America. I am a person who feels like people are stupid for considering America solely as the United States because of the basic functional law that something cannot be of itself. I also feel like its rude to say America because even if you take out South AMERICA and Central AMERICA you still have North AMERICA, which even then encompasses 3 countries. Yes I get that not everyone is going to change the way they function or how theh say things because of a Youtube comment, never have. But even in that I have my right to publicly post my opinion and so I do. You also have that right by Youtube's TOC atleast. The entire point I'm trying to make is burritos are from America because Mexico is in the Americas. That's it. That's literally it. Also Toshy, I doubt youxll read this but Ixm not white. I'll just leave you with that fruit for thought, assume all white people think that way. Anyways I'm basically done with this thread. I'll still leave reply things open for about 24 hours but basically after that don't mention me in it expecting a reply, I'm bored of repeating myself.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@kaden9631,Since burritos were invented?,6년 전,0,
@danoninopal," @kaden9631  Do your research  ""Before the development of the modern burrito, the Mesoamerican peoples of Mexico used corn tortillas in 10,000 B.C. to wrap foods, with fillings of chili peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms, squash, and avocados.[6] Historically, the Pueblo peoples of the Southwestern US also made tortillas filled with beans and meat sauce and prepared much like the modern burrito.[7] But these preparations could also be said to be the origin of the simpler taco, rather than the modern burrito.  The precise origin of the modern burrito is not known. Some have speculated that it may have originated with vaqueros, the cowboys of northern Mexico in the 19th century.[6][8] In the 1895 Diccionario de Mexicanismos, the burrito or taco was identified as a regional item from the Mexican state of Guanajuato and defined as ""Tortilla arrollada, con carne u otra cosa dentro, que en Yucatán llaman coçito""",6년 전,0,

@KiTA-," @dirtdiv3r   No matter how popular the food is or where that popularity stands at the most, which in my opinion; a lot of people probably have never been to Mexico or anywhere else to be able to make judgement and claim burritos in America to be better and therefore should now be an American thing just because we like it and have places like taco bell or chipotle. If you ask me, these places are not authentic and don't even come close to having taste like what a Mexcian styled burrito tastes like. If you are eating taco bell or chipotle and you can proudly say that these dishes are the best you've ever had then I'm sorry but you must not have ever tasted a real burrito before. A burrito is always and has always been a Mexican dish. If you search up what a burrito or a taco is, it will tell you that it is a Mexican dish.  You will never see a burrito or a taco, etc being defined as a dish originating from America because it never was and it never will be. Not even nachos are from America. We love them but the nacho originated from Mexico. Nachos are a Mexican dish from northern Mexico. I am not saying that you haven't but is you haven't had one yet then I would recommend that you try Mexican restuarants in America because a nacho made by a Mexican is way more than just a cheese sauce slapped ontop of a bowl of chips like they do in certain stores in America. The seasonings, they make their own tortilla chips and add so many delicious flavors to it that it would make you never want to eat another simply made nacho. I tried this from a Mexican restuarant and it tasted amazing.  It may be popular in America but if you're getting a taco from taco bell than I would have to say it is not a great choice to compare against a Mexcian styled burrito. For one taco bell is cheaply made tacos/burritos and is no where near what they depict is as on commercials. Not saying that all Mexicans make the best burrito/taco/nacho, etc, and Americas will never compare because that is not true. I've had burritos, tacos, etc from American restaurants many times before when I was little and it tastes delicious and I would definitely go for taco bell every blue moon because even taco bell dishes are very delicious. There are many delicious American styles burrito, taco etc but when you think of a taco or burrito here in America, all of us can agree that we'd want to taste a good, authentic one from times to time, right? Where exactly do we go for this real deal burrito or taco? At least once in our life, we've all have been to a Mexican restuarant to have a taste of a real Mexcians style burrito and taco. We all know for sure that if we had a craving for Mexcian and wouldn't mind spoiling ourselves every once in awhile by spending money on a good burrito that is not cheap like taco bell, we'd go find a Mexcian restaurant for a delicious, authentic Mexican styled burrito and or taco. At least iknow I would at least once in a whilst.   Even though it is popular in America it does not make these dishes ours to claim as it's rightful orgin. It is a Mexican dish that originated from Mexico. Saying that eating a burrito the wrong way makes you not American is pretty stupid of that women to say. For one, it has never been an American dish from the start and Is there actually any right way to eat a burrito really? Because I eat mine with a knife and fork if it is not wrapped up.  (Continue reading on to the next post, couldn't fit all of this in one post)",6년 전(수정됨),4,
@KiTA-," @dirtdiv3r  For those Americans who think that just because we have plenty of stores that sell these things or because we like these items or dishes a lot more etc, we now have the rights to claim it to be an American thing; they are wrong. You can not change history and facts. Tacos, burritos, nacho, etc will always be a Mexican dish and we have no rights to claim it because at the end of the day you, me and everyone else who likes burritos or tacos would  maybe choose these meals made for us by a Mexican in their restuarant over a taco bell if we had more Mexcian Mexcian restaura around for us to enjoy.( This is not a fact by the way. It is just my opinion.) I would definitely choose quality over quantity. We probably wouldn't even know what a burrito or a taco is if not for the Mexicans who introduced it to us.  Many Americans have had Asian dishes before. Sure we could make them at home but isn't it best to enjoy them from an Asian restuarant rather than making the dish ourselves because #1 we don't have many of these Asian ingredient needed to make the meals. We would use what ever items we have that are close enough to make a dish taste like it's Asian food. So soy sauce most likely and a few more ingredients if we are lucky enough to live close to an Asian market. In American markets we can easily buy dumplings, pocky, ramen and other Asian treats/dishes from the Asian aisle but a lot of these things are not freshly made, are frozen or does not have the exact Ingredient needed to make it taste as delicious as you've hoped it would. That is why when we are in the mood for a dish that all of us call Asian food; we get it from an Asian restaurant. Chinese food we get from a Chinese store that is ran by Chinese people. Japanes styled food we'd get from a Japanese restuarant which is prepared by Japanese people. How come we don't consider these Asian dishes an American dish? It's because it's not. We wouldn't have Asian food if it was never introduced to us by Asian countries. This is just my opinion, of course there are non-Asian people who can make an Asian dish and it taste very delicious but I think that the only way to get the very best out of these things is by purchasing them from an Asian market or by sitting down in an Asian restuarant for a true taste of how something such as a dumpling handmade would taste. Yeah we can buy these things in stores or make them ourselves but you'll never get that authentic taste of this dish unless you get it prepared by the hands of where it originated from, which are by Asian people. They will have all the right Ingredients to make sure you are tasting what you'd get if you lived in that Asian country.  This goes for Mexcians food as well. If you want to taste authentic Mexcians food such as a burrito or a taco then it would be best to get it from a Mexican restaurant just like how no one makes a burger better than an American. I have friends from Korea and Japan who visited me and tried a burger in a restuarant. When they ate the burger they were completely surprised by the quality and flavors.They said that they usually never eat burgers back in their Country because it's unhealthy and that it is nothing worth the calories and gaining weight over but when they tried one from the restaurant I took them to here in America they ate burgers almost every afternoon for launch and keep in mind that they were here, visiting for a week.  Do you get what I am trying to say? I am not trying to be mean at all so please don't take this the wrong way and reply to my post with anger and hostility because I am honestly just trying to explain this with no ill intentions to make you look stupid or feel bad. Other people in the comments may be talking harsh to you but I won't. I am just trying to give you my take on what this lady said and how others are saying burritos is an American dish just because a lot of Americans like the dish and you can see a chipotle or taco bell almost on every corner in America. Yes we have these places but almost 50% of Americans would head towards a Mexican restuarant for an authentic tasting burrito and taco if they were feeling like spending a little more money on Mexcian food that is not from the cheap taco bell or chipotle. If we were feeling less cheap and wanted spend money on some freshly made, nice and well seasoned ingredients that's stuffed and wrapped inside a home made tortilla wrap; we would be at a Mexcian restaurant for this. We only ever go to taco bell or chipotle because the prices are low and they make weird shit like a dorito taco shell. I've never been to chipotle before and I haven't been to taco bell since I was 15 and I am 23 right now. If I want a burrito or taco, I am going to a Mexican restuarant for the real deal at least once in a whilst.

@KiTA-," @dirtdiv3r  I am a mixed child and one thing that I am mixed with is Italian. I love love love Italian food. I love pizza and pasta dishes. I'd definitely choose to eat pasta over anything else and I go to genuine Italian restaurants or would follow an Italian recipe for what dish I wanted to make at home, so for me; I know my Italian food pretty well and could evan say I have _some _ standers when it comes to Italian dishes. For the first time in my life I've went to Olive Garden with my friends and tried a pasta dish with a couple of other dishes that we all shared. Olive Garden portrays itself as an Italian-American restuarant so I wouldn't bash on them too hard.  My only criticism on the restuarant is that the pasta I had was very bland and watery. I didn't like it but for my friends who is not that into Italian food as strongly as I; they said it didn't have any seasoning but it was still good after they dipped it in cheese or other sauce. If it wasn't for adding stuff into the pasta then it would not have been enjoyable, however te rest of the meals we ordered were delicious. Alsotl there were no actual Italian chefs making the meals, It was funny because some of the waiters and waitress were New Yorkers putting on a less heavy and more Italian like accent. My waitress was pretty funny because she said there were no Italians working there. They were all normal Americans and about only three were a New York ItalianIt reminded me of this supposedly Japanese restuarant but in reality there were more Mexcians who were pretending to be Japanese, working there.  This is what I meant when I said that going to a restaurant that have real Mexcian, Italian, Asian, etc. chefs who brought themselves and their countries flavors to us to enjoy. You can really taste the difference between a taco bell burrito from a burrito that you'd get from a Mexcian restaurant. Does this make authentic better and American styled version crappy? Hell no because I ate tacos from the small taco stand own by this caucasian dude and the taco was AMAZING. I haven't had taco bell much really but even their food is tasty as hell. So anything can be tasty but if you want an Mexcian styled burrito made by an actual Mexcian who knows his country's flavors then you'd most likely go to a Mexcian restaurant.  I am just trying to say that we can't change the history of a taco/burrito's orgin. It originated from Northern Mexico and Americans love the Mexcian dishes. The burrito/tacos etc we know of today are American styled Mexican dishes but just because burritos of today are American styled does not mean America is where burritos and other Mexican dishes originated from. It is a matter of fact that burritos originated from Mexico as well as other Mexcian dishes. We would not have the burrito of today if not for Mexcians giving life to these dishes and introducing it to the world. Burritos are not originated from America. It originates from Mexico just as Italian, Indian, Asian, etc. dishes originates from their own countries.  The burrito we all know of today are American styled versions of the Mexcian styled burrito but if you are looking for authentic then people would go to a Mexcian restaurant for a taste of Mexcian styled dishes. I think it is great that Americans versions of other country's dishes exist because not only are they tasty but they also give value to the authentic restaurants and when you go to one of these restaurants you will appreciate and love the taste of the dishes served even more. You'd also be able to appreciate the American styled version of these dishes even more.",6년 전,1,
@dirtdiv3r, @KiTA-  I stopped reading when you said I probably haven't been to Mexico or anywhere else... I've traveled to many different countries and lived in the Middle East for a year.  So starting out with a ridiculously ignorant stereotype already lets me know you have pretty invalid opinions.,6년 전,1,
@KiTA-," @dirtdiv3r  I am sorry but please read this and hear me out.... please just hear me out.. I beg of you because you got me all wrong. If you would have refreshed the post and then read it you would have known that there was nothing insulting about my posts nor was I accusing you of anything. In fact I was very careful in making sure that I didn't sound mean or stereotypical. I tried my best to make sure my post was simply giving both sides the benefit of the doubt whilst also trying to explain that even though it is very popular in America does not mean it originated from America. History explains to us exactly how it originates from Mexico and how it made it's way around the world. I even said in the second post, and I quote I am not trying to be mean at all so please don't take this the wrong way becuase there is actually nothing in my post made to be directed towards you. When I say you I am not directing it towards you. This is just my weird way of talking. I am saying you in a way that means some people Please do not assume the worst without giving me a chance. My opinions is based off of the girl who said we are not American if we don't ear a burrito the right way. I've also based my post in response to the people inside of the comments saying burritos originates from America because we like them more than other place.  If you would have kept reading you would have notice how harmless my post are. You saw that it said you've probably never been to Mexcio and took it the wrong way. How would I even know that? I know nothing about you and you still got so offended to where you not only disrespect me but also based the rest of my posts off of a false assumption of one small sentence that was changed almost immediately after I read over my post. Now you gave others a bad depiction of me when none of that is true. I edited my post as fast as I could after posting it and all you had to do was refresh to see what I really meant to say. If anyone should be hurt here it should be me..right? I don't even know you so how would I know what you do in your life? Instead of stopping to think about this for a second, you went full on disrespectful towards me. Any normal person would be immature, arguing with you and saying terrible things about you but I am not about to do that. Last time I checked you are a complete stranger. A better response would have been to say how I don't even know you to be able to say where you have or haven't gone..or you could have maybe refreshed the post to see what I really meant to say. Rather you have or haven't been, it has nothing to do with my posts. I wasn't saying that to poke fun of you. Want to know a truth about me? I have NEVER been to Mexico. I haven't been anywhere that is not close to my home. Movie theaters I can go to, concerts? Yeah but I would get really sick afterwards so my mother doesn't really like it. I've never been to a beach.. I went once when I was just a child and I almost drowned. One thing I remember as I was drowning under the water is that the water was so blue underneath and there were beautiful fishes underneath  the water. Immediately a day after the beach I got terribly sick. I caught pneumonia, an acute chest, pain crisis and was fighting for my life in the hospital for weeks. I've never been back to the beach afterwards. My dream has always been to watch a bed full of stars sparkle above the ocean. I can't even do it though so what makes any think I'd be able to travel? I envy people who can. my illness prevents me from going anywhere without eventually getting terribly sick so congratulations that you get to travel. Do you have any idea how badly I've wanted to see the ocea or travel but can't even do that and you honestly think I was making fun of you for not being somewhere when I would never be able to go myself? What would I gain out of making fun of someone who hasn't traveled? Which in actuality I never said that to be factual. I don't even know you and it honestly had nothing important to do with the real matter my posts are about. I've been stuck in my house with my mother for 23 years because she refuse to let me and my twin go anywhere. We are literally the real life versions of Rapunzel. At least you get to go somewhere so congratulation. You are not trapped in your house and get to live your life to the fullest.  I spent almost two days now on this post wondering how I should type it out so that you don't get offend again. I am nervous to even press send because for all I know you might take this post and turn it negative when it shouldn't be. I made sure that It wouldn't be so I would hope it doesn't offend you. Anyways, I've tried my best to be very careful of what I say so that I didn't cause you to feel threatened by me. When it said you've probably haven't been to Mexico it was not matter of factly and it also wasn't even what I meant to say. Even If you haven't, what's so bad about that? If you have then that is amazing because then you would be able to agree with me when I said that authentic Mexcian burritos are delicious and wouldn't hurt to have once in a whilst instead of taco bell or chipotle. I was saying that there are Authentic Mexican restaurants in America so if these people want to make assumption about how American styled tacos/burritos are better and therefore makes these dishes originate from America and not Mexico; they should at least try a true Mexcian burrito or taco from a Mexcian restaurant first because it would definitely be worth it. I also explained how American styled Mexican dishes are good as well. Even though tacos originate from Mexico does not mean American styled dishes are terrible. I'd go for a taco bell taco any day. I'd still eat them as much as I did when I was little if I felt like it. I barely eat any tacos now but I wouldn't mind going for a dorito loco taco if I ever felt like getting some cheap Mexcian food. If I was hanging out with friends and we were craving Mexcian I wouldn't mind going to a Mexcian restaurant for an authentic Mexcian styled burrito neither if I was feeling like spending a little extra money. I literally don't have a type and American styled versions of food is just as good as the ones made by the people the dishes originated from. It's a win-win situation in my book but we should never forget where these delicious meals originated from because burritos have in fact originated from Mexico and not from America like some people are saying it does. I dunno if you agree that it originate from America and I quite frankly am not going to beat you up about it if you did. I just want to give a little education towards those who are kind enough to listen without assuming the worst or getting affected by my words negatively when It was never my intention to sound like I was belittling you guys or insulting you. (Again not directed towards you. When I say you. I mean it as *them, some people, or they ) my post is not limited to or directed souly towards anyone in specific and I am sorry if you got offended but I really think you were not being fair because you took something very small and harmless and turned it into a harsh assumption when my post truly had no Ill intentions. It was not fair to me but I am genuinely sorry if you were offended even though that part of my post was edited long before you started reading. You were just unlucky and read my post at the wrong time and I was unlucky for not editing it quick enough. I would hope you open your heart a little more and try to realize that no everyone in this world is out to hurt you. I saw people being mean to you and calling you harsh things and I wanted to approach you in a gentle manner so that I do not seem like I was there to attack you as others were. Even now I will not insult you after all the stuff you said to hurt me. You may not even read this whole thing so I won't continue posting. I said what I had to say and I also did my best to provide evidence that I was not trying to be mean and judgemental. I wouldn't even have bother to type out so much if I really was here to put you down. I am not that kind of person and it hurts me a little that you judged me based off of nothing. I hope you have a good morning/afternoon/night/evening. Take a break from the internet, relax and try to enjoy a little time to yourself. I am off to bed now because I am stuck in the hospital and am pretty tired. Ciao.",6년 전,2,

@_3NVY_,Publishing fake new is bad.  We aleready have bad information enough. Medias aren't suppose to seek sensationalism. They are moving away from their main focus which is informing peoples. The fact that they published the content without checking the source says very long about the truth that comes from these platforms. Nevertheless good job creating that fake new but very sad the medias are publishing things that are not even checked.,6년 전,0,

Just look at all the recent charges about rape and I'm not even talking about the celebrities but just regular chicks doing it to the guys who they don't like. The lives are ruined and you are guilty until proven innocent. The word is gone to shit with things like these and media is rather abusing that to gain more control rather than to provide accurate information.,6년 전,5,

(everyone in the room starts jumping and screaming around) For me this exemplary of how the world is damned. The entire world and the media flipped about how ONE SINGLE person eats a damn burrito. We have so, so much bigger problems like pollution, industrial world damnation, animal extinction, thousands even millions dying of poverty, hunger or serious sicknesses, and no one even cares..... Sad is the world we live in.  Your children who you love the most, the ones you leave to your legacy, will have to fight the battle in a rotting junk filled dying world because you didn't care. Because you ran from responsibilities. That is your true legacy. Let that sink in for a moment.  If every single one of us tried to be just a bit better, the planet might remain a habitable place for the ones we leave behind.",6년 전,10,

@key2success746,yeah-from my reads on a few sites Ive read that they still originated in Mexico but just in Northern mexico as Karla Munoz had stated. they were only made in other parts of Mexico for tourist purposes but nonetheless still originated in Northern Mexico. Also they were brought to America during the Mexican/American War. And thats how America became familiar with the Burrito. So despite Americans taking-yet another food from another culture during another rough time for that culture- despite the tourists. Burritos are in fact not American. They weren't made for them. And although they are not from everywhere in Mexico they still originated in Mexico. That was the point. I think its common for people to not know about to origin of certain things in culture- because sometimes it isnt as popular in the areas our families grew up in but Dont be brainwashed yall. This is not America's.,6년 전(수정됨),0,

I just dont want people forgetting that America isnt our culture. Its a blend of everyone elses culture and it makes us think that the things our people created aren't rightfully ours because of years being taught that it belongs to America simply based on the fact that they STOLE it.  like Thanksgiving. We were all taught at one point the Native Americans and Pilgrims were all a big happy family but later learned that nah The pilgrims and europeans enslaved these people, mentally, Physically, spiritually. and thats why we have so many brainwashed generations.

Who broke apart the map and claimed different nations as their own without even accepting or supporting the culture of those nations? it was simply to expand on land and goods. How can we say that because Mexico is in North America they are just as American as Americans in the UNITED STATES, when who we know today as ""Americans"" dont even acknowledge them as Human Beings let alone Americans? do you understand the point Im trying to get at?

@a.s514,"I admire the way you guys were able to get something viral so quickly and I think it was great work. I mean no offense to anybody by this but I really think this needs to be said. (None of this is directed at Yes Theory, it is directed to everybody)  The fact that SO many people deemed it necessary to share this, to the point of where it made it on the news really shows us where this world is headed. It's time people started waking up and snapping back to reality because if you're giving up your own time to share pictures of a famous person eating food (regardless of how they eat it, regardless of what they're doing for that matter) then your head isn't screwed on right.  If you can't find something better to do with your time besides sharing pictures of people eating food, all hope is lost for you.  That being said, the news on television these days has become complete garbage. The fact this went viral and made it on the news is clear evidence of how they're trying to brainwash you. Is it really that fucking important to show a picture of Justin Bieber eating a burrito over whats really going on in the world?

Sounds like you are a dick that feels like a spoiled brat who knows nothing about the rest of the world if you think the U.S.A is the best. It is a great country, but definitely not the best.

It's the richest, most influential country of all and alongside Japan the most important country for scientific and technologic development. When I call people spolied I don't mean it as a personal attack like you did when you called me a dick (for retaliation, such a childish behavior), but as a fact. People living in an amazing country with a great economy and population, calling americans stupid because of the most trivial matters.

U.S.A. has a higher crime rate than many european countries, but it's not a determining factor as to say U.S.A. is a terrible country because of its crime rates. I don't understand why would not being on some guy's list make the country worse, but ok. It's funny how you say I have no idea what's happening outside my 'american bubble'.

I started to believe that I was going to end up a statistic or a casualty and maybe even both, but watching your videos and hearing your stories made me one get the feels and two inspired to make a bucket list and actually follow through with it. I always wanted to start my own YouTube channel and I put that on the top of my list. I’m struggling to think of an introductory video where I can show everyone who I am and what I want to accomplish on this platform. I’m constantly inspired just by watching your videos but I put meeting you all on my bucket list to hopefully one day get to sit down and get some genuine advice about YouTube and life in general! Law of attraction says that this WILL happen in my life time. So with all that said this guy from small town Oxnard California plans to make his dreams come true and no longer hold himself back because of where he’s from and you dudes and your videos have brought so much joy to me and the whole meaning of YES THEORY itself /alone helped kickstart a whole new way of thinking for not just me but so many others , keep doing what ya doing and continue to make dope ass content, good bye for now boys 🙏🏻",6년 전,2,

Where were his fans who can't even tell the difference? I knew it wasn't him in an instant and I am no die hard fan.

I’ve always have  had a passion for helping those around me. So In school, I took a course called “Leadership”. I am always open to new opportunities and always trying my best to test my discomfort in many ways!! In my leadership class, my summative is to do an initiative that will help those around me and make a change in the community. I’ve been watching your videos since early 2016 and you guys have always wanted to make a change in the world which personally inspired me to do the same ever since!! If it’s possible, I was hoping if you guys can come to Ottawa and help me make an initiative idea that spread and influence positive change in my community and hopefully my city!! This goes far beyond my summative, this allows the community to connect together as one and help inspire those around us to make the world a better place. I know this is a long shot and you probably won’t see it, but everyone has to try and start somewhere. Please think about it, thank you so much.",6년 전,0,

And ever if it was “MexTex” honey, it’s not that American, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrito that the English version and they have 1 theory developed in Texas and after many years, in LA, but the first ones and there are a lot more versions from  in Mexico, so it’s basically Mexican, NOT American lol get over yourselfs, not everything it’s made first or better in the US",6년 전,0,

I’m glad that Yes Theory contacted Bieber’s manager to tell him (although he already knew it was them) and that he was down with it and he decided to even played along with the prank. I guess it is like Matt said, Justin, being that famous is (unfortunately) used to the media talking about every little thing he does (or in this case does not do). ....As long as we all learn something (positive) and are all (trying) just a little bit to be a better human being at the end of the day, that is what is important.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@caligulalonghbottom2629," @tropicalorange1237  I dont and haven't ever really followed Bieber. I just think hes fuckable, thats about the extent of my knowledge of him lol.  The wig DID instantly make him look like him, before it, I was doubtful. But, it was platinum and Biebs hair isnt or wasnt in the recent days before this happened. All they would have needed to do is take some light brown  and dark blonde hair dyes and messily run them through parts of the wig with their fingers and then wash it out in like 5 minutes and it would have given the wig that dirty blonde and actually dirty look of Biebers hair. Not really that hard.  Here is a MENS wig that would have worked better https://johnblakeswigs.com/shop/mens-wigs/12-inch-regular-mens-wigs/ The color is even wayyyyy better  and with the extra touch ups of the other darker blonde colors running through it would have worked. It also has a male hairline which would have instantly made it look realistic, whether the hairline was covered with the beanie or not, the volume in that area makes it not work.",6년 전,1,

@saiaha,"Brandon Keating Hi,   Justin Bieber is an entertainer, public perception is essential to his career.   The “rule” and what we prefer to call precedent , was the supreme courts ruling in America regarding freedom of the press.  The case against the New York Times, set the precedent that the press could freely report any public figure. If the press knowingly ran a FALSE story, that’s where they would be held liable for damages. It does not exempt the press from not doing their due diligence. They still must check their stories accuracy.   I stated that it would be funny if he sues the men responsible for this “prank”.   Justin could argue that it made a mockery of him and, that they had malicious intent due to their desire to get a reaction.   The men in this video went on Reddit and published their own picture knowing it wasn’t Justin Bieber. They also knew because it was Justin Bieber, their would be a big reaction. Depending on the way they profited from this act, which you do get paid for YouTube views, it could be an issue.   It may be a silly one to you but, legally there’s a case.   Although, what would I know as a second year law student. Unlike you, I don’t believe you have to be a lawyer to understand the law. If you have a rebuttal I would love to hear it.",6년 전(수정됨),5,

On top of that it's pure fun, and no one is hurt. Just imagine if everyone starts doing this all day. Crazy celebrities spotted everywhere, news and media overflowing with paparazzi pictures that no one can tell apart from the real ones. Eventually people will no longer freak out whenever they see leaked pictures of celebrities, or when they spot them in the streets, because they know it could be a poser etc. If 1000 guys walks around looking like Justin Bieber, people will get used to it, then finally he can actually go outside again and not stick out and be attacked by paparazzi.

My names Alexander I've been following your chanel from when you had something like 30000 followers, and you're all doing fantastic things and changing people's live for the better! Now for why I'm contacting you, I'm flying to Vancouver in 10days with my bike and starting the most insane trip I've ever had the opportunity to plan.. I'll be cycling from Vancouver Canada all the way to Cabo San Lucas Mexico which is about 4500kms away from Vancouver I'll most likely end up biking around 5000kms. Once in Cabo San Lucas I'm meeting up with a good friend of mine and we will be sailing to the Marquesas Islands (french polynesia) in the middle of the south Pacific with is also about 5000kms away. So in total I'll be going around 10000kms on this trip! I sold my car to help fund it and I'm a Wildland firefighter in the summers in the Yukon where I'm from. I was wondering if we could meet up or if you guys could help me bike/sail for a cause so it's not just an adventure but for Something bigger than all of us!  I've never done any bike tours before and I've never gone sailing before but because of watching you guys just go for it I said fuck it and bought a bike and a one way ticket to Vancouver!",6년 전,37,

Just then Ammar, Matt, Bieber, and Thomas (or Carl depending) jump out from behind every piece of furniture imaginable and yell ""Happy surprise birthday party!!!

@brandonwilliams6221,"“Little effort”? Bro, they had to fly in a look-a-like. And how can they be so “oblivious” when they evidently called the source of the picture to confirm it was real. What more do you want them to do? Be omnipotent? A bus full of tourist thought it was Justin Bieber in person. I bet Justin’s publicist thought it was him for a second. I don’t know what else you expect them to do?",6년 전,1,
@blakeharrell7457," @brandonwilliams6221  I agree with you that it was a good stunt and it was convincing. My whole point was that if you expand this to more important subjects our (if you're American) media covers such as politics, campaigns, and businesses then they readily accepted it. Yeah they did a 5 minute video chat, but you saw where they fed him lines. And yeah you can say that this is just celebrity news and maybe they don't have to do as much research or fact-checking, but just google all the stories that are spun from reddit or twitter or facebook that eventually make it to the main stream media. And yes I think that taking a 4 hour plane trip to just take pictures while waiting for 2 days for it to go viral is not that much effort since they did have a convincing guy.",6년 전,0,

@YGacs," @DavidFriendReporter  Yeah so that the prank can go on for a while longer, and then reveal the prank by the end of the weekend. Pretty smart of Yes Theory!",6년 전,0,
@DavidFriendReporter," Leonardo Santuario  Agreed. This suggests that people are foolish if they believe anything. Chicken Nugget is saying the news is foolish to believe people it interviews, citizens are foolish to believe the news, everyone is foolish to believe anything. So what have we got then? Nothing?  All Yes Theory proves is something we already know from Donald Trump -- a bunch of people willing to put themselves and their profits/YouTube views over common decency in an attempt to smear the media sets everyone back. Sure, these outlets (mostly not serious news from what I can tell) were stupid to run this story, and yes, the story was stupid before the outlets even ran it. But it does damage to ALL media, including the media that's out there doing good work every single day. Everyone on here is posting about how ""the media"" is so terrible like it's one giant entity -- and there is where the serious damage lies.  Nobody wins from this prank except Yes Theory and maybe Justin Bieber who gets his song played on the radio a few more times after the DJs talk about this latest development. Yes Theory isn't even really trying to prove a point -- or if they were, they didn't articulate it very well. They're doing this prank in a very volatile climate where the media is constantly under attack by the president of the United States. We don't need pithy pranks clouding this process any more, imo.  Cue the people saying ""God, it was just a joke"" as the views climb to 1 million and beyond in under 24 hours.",6년 전(수정됨),2,

@vijay20," @stoulmar2550  mate, i'd suggest you take a better look at my comment. there were two separate points made in it. Shane's content has been fairly good the last year or so. It certainly isn't for kids with a shorter attention span, but it is definitely better than many others in the 10-50 mil subbers band. I'm 32, so i think my point herein carries far more weight than a kid. :)",6년 전,0,

I hope you just read this comment because I think this is very important these days- especially when you experience by yourselfs that you can reach nearly everybody and I think you should use this (I know you already do but I think with such an action as u all did this time it can reach even more people around the world)  #spreadpeace,6년 전,1,

And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.
