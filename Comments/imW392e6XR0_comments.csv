Pretty sure the Julia Roberts 'mean tweet' is from a Chinese person. The Chinese are into small mouths. And. I remember seeing Ethan Hawke, first time. 'Dead Poet Society.' I remember thinking he was lucky. I think it's kinda random, that someone would single him out as 'the one who snuck through the cracks.' It's not like he's declining in some unusually noticeable way. In theory, to do a good 'mean tweet,' it's actually what people call 'a roast,' I believe. The idea is to be familiar with someone you are 'attacking verbally.' And if it's based in reality, it's funny. The stuff, here, is just venting behind a computer screen or phone.",2년 전,0,

@forpbrrosema5578,I used to think Jimmy Kimmel was cute and kind of funny but then I thought about it and HE IS LITERALLY CRUEL AND MEAN. MAKING FUN OF A RECOVERY FROM CRACK AND TELLING THE WORLD SOMEONE IS W CRACK HEAD AND THEN AGAIN AND AGAIN. THE DUDE GOT CLEANED UP and I don’t care who you are or how horrible of a person you might be somebody who recovered from an addiction and is still out in the world surviving is not to be made fun of for their old addiction that is insanity to make fun of somebody like that when you make fun of someone who again has recovered from being addicted to something like crack you’re making fun of every single other person out there in the world who was on crack or heroin or any other substance like this and recovered so he’s not just making fun of the pillow guy he’s making fun of everybody who has ever had an addiction but he obviously doesn’t understand the reasons behind and that could be somebody in his audience it could be Russell Brand who is an amazing human being could be someone in his family someday. That is just an example. The Donald Trump talk is SOOOOOOOO OLD! Just keeps saying crap about him and he hasn’t even been President for over a year BUT HE CAN BE CRUEL AND SAY SOMETHING MEAN AND MAKE FUN OF THE MAN AND SO HE KEEPS GOING BACK TO TALKING ABOUT THE GUY. GIVE THE DUDE MORE ATTENTION WHY DONT YOU IS WHAT I FEEL. HE WAS NOT TAUGHT TO TREAT PEOPLE AS HE WOULD WANT TO BE TREATED OR THE WAY KARMA COULD COME AROUND AND THAT COULD BE A DECADE OR THE NEXT WEEK BUT IT DOES NOT SEEM TO WORRY HIM. WHAT MAKE JIMMY KIMMEL SO ANGRY AND HORRIBLE AND JUDGMENTAL ABOUT EVERYONE ELSE’S PROBLEMS AND EVERYTHING EVERYONE ELSE IS OR DOES AND WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT ABOUT HIM THAT HE DOESN’T HAVE TO ANSWER TO ANYONE FOR USING VERBAL ABUSE TO GET TO TALK ABOUT OTH PE IN A CLEARLY PRETENTIOUS I AM SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE WORLD ATTIT IN LIFE? He said mean and cruel and intentional stuff more than he has said anything at all combined. Maybe that’s the problem. I don’t know how to spell it out for people but more cruelty in this world and harmful comments and telling people that a recovery happens to make them worse still because they had a problem that stems from underlying depression and something usefully very bad happening in life like abuse or bullying or being molested as a child and the like that is something that they can get to say that they are free from being able to use drugs to cope with the things they are not expressing to the entire world is not making the world a normal place it would spread HATE AND WE ARE ALL HUMAN BEINGS …. WE DO NOT TREAT ANOTHER HUMAN BEING LIKE THAT AND NOT CAUSE SERIOUS DAMAGE AND OTHERS TO LASH OUT AT ANYONE ELSE BECAUSE OF THE EXAMPLE THAT SOMEONE ELSE CAN SET LIKE THAT. I HOPE HE GETS SOME HELP. LIKE A THERAPIST TO GET THE ANGER OUT SO PEOPLE DON’T Emulate him anymore as I’m sure millions have in ways that he is part responsible for. I don’t like mean things all the time or judging others if it’s not in the name of humor or in good fun or everything they are ever doing or being like especially. I’m done watching any other video of the man. I feel sorry about the ways he has been and I don’t necessarily like or respect anyone he is talking about either. Thank you for listening. I’m done. I know I sound the same as I’m accusing him of being but my comments come from a place of love not being mean for the sake of meanness. Sorry.,3년 전,0,

Call upon Jesus now and ask Him into  your life and to forgive your sins.   hell is the absence of God Almighty who gives us the breath in our lungs, water, food, sunshine,  love, kindness, patience, faithfulness, hope, rest, help etc.  hell is real and its a place of torment: you will have to live with all your mistakes, regrets, you will feel all  the pain you caused others...  you be hungry but not be able to eat you will be thirsty but wont be able to drink you will be tired but cant sleep you will have no hope you will have no rest you will feel pure hatred towards you (satan and the fallen  angels/demons hate you and want to drag you to hell)  “For the wages of sin is death (hell), but the gift of God is eternal  life in Christ Jesus our Lord” -Romans 6:23 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes  to the Father except through me."" -John 14:6 ""But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my  Father which is in heaven."" -Matthew 10:33",3년 전,1,

YOU CAN STAND ON YOUR OWN AGAINST GOD AND TRY TO JUSTIFY YOUR SIN WHEN  YOU WONT EVEN BE ABLE TO LOOK UP YOU WILL BE WEEPING IN TERROR REALIZING YOU  MADE A BIG MISTAKE.  YOU WONT WIN AN ARGUMENT WITH GOD, HE CREATED  EVERYTHING!!!  GOD SEES EVERYTHING YOUVE EVER DONE; YOU WONT FOOL HIM!!!  OR   PUT YOUR TRUST IN JESUS WHO DIED ON THE CROSS AND TOOK THE WRATH OF GOD IN  OUR PLACE FOR OUR SINS.  IT'S A FREE GIFT BUT HE CANT FORCE YOU TO TAKE  IT.  WILL YOU CALL UPON HIM NOW AND SURRENDER TO HIM.  TALK TO HIM LIKE  ABEST FRIEND, HE'S WAITING AND HE LOVES YOU.   Turn back to God  Our Creator, not religion.  Religion creates bondage, in Christ there is  freedom.  Im not talking church, im not talking religion, im talking  relationship with your Creator.  Call upon Jesus now and ask Him into  your life and to forgive your sins.   hell is the absence of God Almighty who gives us the breath in our lungs, water, food, sunshine,  love, kindness, patience, faithfulness, hope, rest, help etc.  hell is real and its a place of torment: you will have to live with all your mistakes, regrets, you will feel all  the pain you caused others...  you be hungry but not be able to eat you will be thirsty but wont be able to drink you will be tired but cant sleep you will have no hope you will have no rest you will feel pure hatred towards you (satan and the fallen  angels/demons hate you and want to drag you to hell)  “For the wages of sin is death (hell), but the gift of God is eternal  life in Christ Jesus our Lord” -Romans 6:23 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life.

Call upon Jesus now and ask Him into  your life and to forgive your sins.   hell is the absence of God Almighty who gives us the breath in our lungs, water, food, sunshine,  love, kindness, patience, faithfulness, hope, rest, help etc.  hell is real and its a place of torment: you will have to live with all your mistakes, regrets, you will feel all  the pain you caused others...  you be hungry but not be able to eat you will be thirsty but wont be able to drink you will be tired but cant sleep you will have no hope you will have no rest you will feel pure hatred towards you (satan and the fallen  angels/demons hate you and want to drag you to hell)  “For the wages of sin is death (hell), but the gift of God is eternal  life in Christ Jesus our Lord” -Romans 6:23 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes  to the Father except through me."" -John 14:6 ""But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my  Father which is in heaven."" -Matthew 10:33",3년 전,3,

I'm saddened by any one  saying Ashton Kutcher needs to get hit by a bus. That's a human being. I wish all the animators of south park would quit making that tv show and go back to their families.,5년 전(수정됨),0,

ASK HIM TO FORGIVE YOUR SINS    STOP PUTTING YOUR HOPE IN THE GOVERNMENT, IN RELIGION, IN SCIENCE, IN  WEALTH, IN CELEBS, IN SPORTS, IN THE WORLD (IT WILL PERISH!)  YOU CAN STAND ON YOUR OWN AGAINST GOD AND TRY TO JUSTIFY YOUR SIN WHEN  YOU WONT EVEN BE ABLE TO LOOK UP YOU WILL BE WEEPING IN TERROR REALIZING YOU  MADE A BIG MISTAKE.  YOU WONT WIN AN ARGUMENT WITH GOD, HE CREATED  EVERYTHING!!!  GOD SEES EVERYTHING YOUVE EVER DONE; YOU WONT FOOL HIM!!!  OR   PUT YOUR TRUST IN JESUS WHO DIED ON THE CROSS AND TOOK THE WRATH OF GOD IN  OUR PLACE FOR OUR SINS.  IT'S A FREE GIFT BUT HE CANT FORCE YOU TO TAKE  IT.  WILL YOU CALL UPON HIM NOW AND SURRENDER TO HIM.  TALK TO HIM LIKE  ABEST FRIEND, HE'S WAITING AND HE LOVES YOU.   Turn back to God  Our Creator, not religion.  Religion creates bondage, in Christ there is  freedom.  Im not talking church, im not talking religion, im talking  relationship with your Creator.  Call upon Jesus now and ask Him into  your life and to forgive your sins.   hell is the absence of God Almighty who gives us the breath in our lungs, water, food, sunshine,  love, kindness, patience, faithfulness, hope, rest, help etc.  hell is real and its a place of torment: you will have to live with all your mistakes, regrets, you will feel all  the pain you caused others...  you be hungry but not be able to eat you will be thirsty but wont be able to drink you will be tired but cant sleep you will have no hope you will have no rest you will feel pure hatred towards you (satan and the fallen  angels/demons hate you and want to drag you to hell)  “For the wages of sin is death (hell), but the gift of God is eternal  life in Christ Jesus our Lord” -Romans 6:23 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life.

Watch we might see even more legends get trashed wrongfully that shouldn't be hated like Leonardo DiCaprio, Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Daniel Day-Lewis, Jack Nicholson, etc. If Gary Oldman gets insulted, I've already seen it all smh.

@ishfarahmed3684,He aint top 10 but he is top 20 though here is my personal top 20 all time: 1. Marlon Brando 2. Al Pacino 3. Daniel Day-Lewis 4. Jack Nicholson 5. Robert De Niro 6. Laurence Olivier 7. Leonardo DiCaprio 8. Tom Hanks 9. Dustin Hoffman 10. Paul Newman 11. Denzel Washington 12. Sidney Poitier 13. Anthony Hopkins 14. James Stewart 15. Gary Oldman 16. Spencer Tracy 17. Morgan Freeman 18. Michael Caine 19. Peter O'Toole 20. Philip Seymour Hoffman,5년 전(수정됨),0,
@michaelvevo743," @ishfarahmed3684  The list seems perfect. I agree with you. Brando at the top is obvious. Followed by Al Pacino, Nicholson etc. Al Pacino is a greater method actor compared to Nicholson. And Laurence Olivier even though a great actor who could enunciate the works of Shakespeare with perfection, isn't as good as many of the method actors before him in your list. Tom Hanks is my most favorite actor, but he's definitely not the best. Also it makes sense to place Denzel Washington lower. He's a great actor, but not as great as the one mentioned before him. Spencer Tracy, James Stewart lived in an Era were  actors performed theatrically even in Cinema. Their performances, even though good weren't like really natural. I've noticed this from his collaborations with Hitchcock and the movie It's a Wonderful Life. Anthony Hopkins is a great actor. But it's one performance that made him stand out among so many others. I guess we both know which film that is. Paul Newman's a good actor. I've loved his performances in movies like Cool Hand Like, The Color Money, A Cat on A Hot Tin Roof etc. Philip Seymour never got to show us more of what he had since he passed away at an early age.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@pandakadabra," @huchan3837  Actually I think he's a marvelous actor, humble and down-to-earth, trained to be as egoless as possible, so the roles shine through him somewhat, he's maybe even a method actor which are my favorite types (and apparently world's too, I just googled famous method actors); and that's exactly why such that innocent joke tweet at him is infinitely funny coz it's aimed at his humility, saying that he ""slipped through the cracks"" to become a famous actor. I was just continuing that genius, innocent humor. Humor is best understood subjectively, not with logic :) so if you ask ""why"" it means you've already missed it!",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@Googlize1,"Osama Bin Laden .... I'm Australian.  This ""homophobic majority"" are also old, poor, and raised in an environment that dictates their way of thinking. When you look at the demographics of it, the most homophobic countries are impoverished and have a backwards government. So, your country, probably.  Homophobes may be the majority, but they're not advancing in society. In fact, they're declining. See, the most homophobic age group is the elderly while the most accepting age group is the young and middle-aged. You're a bit behind with your ""way of thinking""... The most accepting countries of homosexuality are Scandinavian and European -- the most forward thinking, progressive and successful countries in the world. African and Asian countries are also the most homophobic, and look at how they're going... Not great.  So sorry if your ""way of thinking"" is what you've been raised with, if it's what you've been taught, if it's what you believe in or if it's simply tradition, but homophobia won't be the majority and while we progress with a more accepting society, you'll still be a third world country.",9년 전,3,

The final girl, Sidney Prescott, survives Scream 1, then in 2 she is more grown-up and the events changed her, but after the second massacre, part 3 shows her being completely scared for her life and hiding from even her friends. However, in the grand finale, she becomes strong and fights for her life and wins. And in Scream 4, which takes place 10 years after 3, she is now a strong woman, and a true survivor. And she is no longer scared to confront the killer(s). See? Isn't that nice? :]",9년 전,0,

@Metalchick721,"Lupita V. I stand by my first statement. When it comes to comedy, either everything is sacred or nothing is. ",10년 전,1,
@lupitav.9810,"Metalchick721 Sorry but I don't see you're first comment unless you're referring to the question you asked me. Its a probability Jimmy Kimmel did put this comedy section to get some laughs but all the famous people you see on here can do other things than read hate comments about them for money. So personally, I can't help but think that if they agreed to do this, its either to show people that they don't care what people say or to get people to think about what they say before they say it. I've seen comedians say inappropriate stuff and that's fine if you find that kind of stuff funny but I won't laugh at another persons expense. That's just my decision though and I will preach against hate anytime I see it. ",10년 전,0,

@lupitav.9810,"Metalchick721 ""People"" or you? Regardless of what you or anybody else thinks of me, I'm still going to comment whether you want me to or not. Pretentious means coming off as trying to impress people. The word your thinking of is cocky. You can think what you want of me The Lord knows I can't control that but I know i'm just confident in who I am and I don't need to prove that to anybody especially not to someone who tries to attack me personally because their argument failed.  Despite your insults, I have nothing against you personally.",10년 전,0,
@Metalchick721,"Lupita V. You say you're not trying to prove something and yet you keep going. Your general speech has a ""Holier-than-thou"" feel to it, and no most people don't want to listen to someone who speaks as though they are above them. ",10년 전,0,
@lupitav.9810,"Metalchick721 Yeah I keep going because I believe in what I say.  I don't want people to not think about what they say before they do it because one person doesn't think its a big deal. Its only not a big deal to you because nobody's directing any hate comments at you. Doesn't matter how you say it, like I said before people can think what they want of me its really none of my business what they think. However, if even one person looks at the comment that I made and  they start considering what I said than it was well worth it. I'm not arguing for the looks and that's the truth you can believe what you want. In fact, i'm not even sure if anybody else is actually reading our comments when there's tons of other comments on this video and it would be pretty egotistical for me to presume they are. If you haven't noticed you keep arguing as well and I get it. We live in a society where everyone wants the last word. I'll be honest, so do I. I'm willing to put my pride aside and I won't respond to anything else you say because i'm capable of change.",10년 전,0,

In a way, it shows that we're all more alike than we think - there will be ppl who won't like us even when we're good, and the person writing them might not be right anyway. It just shows how varied opinions can be. This discussion is a testament to that. I understand that some of the celebs look hurt, and that makes me sad, but by watching, I feel for them and want to help them up. So the insult can have an opposite effect, and I wouldn't be surprised if that's the reason for this segment - most of the insults are absurd which diminishes the comment as a result!",10년 전,0,

""The use of 'n for ""and"" or ""ing"" is of course totally different from writing still kickin', which seems to me more closely follows the rule of abbreviations that the apostrophe takes the place of the dropped letter(s), as with ""Oh no you didn't!"". A Google search for ""rock n roll"" turned up rock 'n' roll (the way I have written it in the past, following the rule), rock-n-roll, Rock""N""Roll, Rock'n'Roll, as well as rock 'n roll""  however that was from a blog.. so not the most reliable source admittedly.    I didn't intend on having a long back and forth about it,",10년 전,0,
@aliddas,"Smdylan Yes it can be used differently, but in my concept, you are wrong about ""freak'n"" because if you use common knowledge and logic, you would know that in the concept I used, it would be ""freaking brains"" not ""freak and brains"". Like if you use the knowledge said in that blog, you could easily figure out when ""and"" or ""ing"" is used.  If you try it out on my concept, you would know it's ""ing"" not ""and"". But if you try it on ""rock and roll"" you would know it's ""and"" not ""ing"". Get the point ? So if you say it should be ""and"" in my concept, it would be wrong.

@gojuryu83,"Chris Purolover I see you're one of the number of those self-righteous self-appointed preachers with the scientific literacy of a 5 year old. Don't worry, your kind is all too common. You are obviously completely ignorant of every study made and book written on human sexuality in the XX century, which sadly I can't sum up here in words you would understand. Biology, ethology and zoology other areas you clearly know nothing about (though that doesn't hinder you from spewing apodictic claims related to them). In that regard, I would like to point out that there are dozens of species in the animal kingdom that practice oral sex. If you think it's not natural, take it up with the sheep, fruit bats, bears and pretty much all apes which are doing it as we speak, to list but a few. As for the biological and evolutionary purpose of oral sex, have you read anything about it before dictating that is doesn't have any? It isn't an a priori truth, you know. By the way, I'd like you to tell me what the biological purpose of abstinence is, since you're seemingly all about teleology.   The idea that abstinence is about controlling ""primitive needs"" derivates from medieval christian philosophy. It was an alien notion to ancient Greeks and Romans (who weren't exactly what you'd call ""primitive""), for instance, who understood full well that abstinence can be as much a vice as promiscuity. Humans are one of the very few species in the animal kingdom who practices sex as a way to connect emotionally to a partner. Self-inflicted abstinence, however, is exclusively human, as are other ""virtuous"" traits connected to religious ideology, such as bodily mortification, suicide terrorism and holy war.  Moreover, to some people - like yourself, apparently - the idea of having sex is as abhorrent as not having sex is for promiscuous people. The idea that the culture you happen to live in predominantly deems your behaviour more virtuous than the latter is purely accidental and doesn't make you any more virtuous than a nimphomaniac or a satyriasist. But I'm glad it makes you feel happy. Just don't assume you are in a moral high ground because you got geographically lucky. And while I am undoubtedly a disgusting piece of shit, I'm not an ignorant piece of shit. You, on the other hand, are. You should try being more promiscuous in your reading. Abstinence in that regard is definitely not working out for ya.",10년 전,7,

That things can't go from point A to point B without actually traveling between those points. That energy spreads out and weakens as it spreads out. That things are either in one place or they are spread out. All the things people like to believe about the gods that we have invented here on earth are just fantasies. When we were children, we all imagined things like flying, or teleportation, or wishes that could come true. But when you grow up, you're supposed to forget about things like that and learn to live in reality and accept things the way they are. Anything is possible, but the stories that people told themselves thousands of years ago about powerful beings that lived in the sky or at the top of the mountain or wherever are clearly just that: stories. Jehovah is no more likely to be true then is Thor or Zeus or Osiris or any other. Christianity is very widespread, but that's largely because people who didn't accept Christianity were murdered hundreds of years ago. That doesn't make it any more likely that Jehovah is real. If there is something much more powerful than us somewhere out there, it probably won't resemble in any way the things described in the Bible. Why would they?

A few things to consider, God cannot be ""figured out"" with humanistic reasoning in the same way you can't fit an ocean into a bathtub. Which is fine because that's the beauty of discovery as humans learn more and more about His creation. Lastly, if Jesus says to not lie than He Himself couldn't be a liar or else His sacrifice to forgive all sins (blindness to God) would be invalid.

@GirlyGamer821,"Cam Maida It's funny, wouldn't you think? Assuming 'He' exist, I question a lot of things about the God you seem to be devoted to, and one thing I do question is his morals. You have murder and rape and illness, deaths long before needed and wars killing people and our earth like we're trying to meet a quota. It's too easy of an answer to say He is testing our faith because any bad thing that happens is just another trial, but how crappy is that? He is written and believed to have the power to save us from all these things and yet won't because he was us to prove our devotion. Going with the assumption that He exist, he's really no better than a king who kings the wife of his soldier to see if he'll revolt. Honestly, even if a figure did fall from the sky and prove He was the God all the stories have spoken of, I wouldn't bow down. I wouldn't kneel and devote myself to his way of life because I wouldn't want to get into 'Heaven' under those guidelines. But this is a Jimmy Kimmel video and I don't know how Philosophy got into the mix. Have a good day",10년 전,0,

@cammaida5137,"Carla Cook   Speaking of assuming, that is pretty much the entire length of your post. You're forgetting freewill and the consequences that go with it. God remains ""unseen"" not so much because He's ""testing our faith"" but because He's allowing mankind to live out their lives in the choices they make weather good or bad. Jesus said ""those who have see me, also see the Father because I do His will. I'm pretty sure if I asked you what Jesus Himself was known for, you wouldn't have anything negative to say in return. God's law is simply a reflection of His perfection, Christ fulfilled it and we just have to live by it through Christ. Not to mention, humans were practically made for worship, it just depends WHAT they choose to worship, whether or not it's God or earthly things.",10년 전,0,

@Softie.222,Ricky Tam are you with them every moment of their lives? Didn't think so. You don't know what they do with their time and money. Just because you don't like their music or them as a person doesn't give you the right to determine their worth. It just shows your character and what a waste someone is when they speak bad about others. They're just worthless and show it with every word they speak or type. Famous or not these are still people and if that's so hard for you and anyone else to grasp then that's just sad. Stop focusing on how much you hate someone's voice or how they're not attractive and focus on fixing your disgusting personality. ,10년 전,0,

I don't hate these people in particular because I feel that it's not right to hate someone unless you truly know them but just because they do good stuff every time a pig flies doesn't mean that their bullshit should be looked over either. (this is about no one in particular) and back on the topic at hand, I am more than allowed to say that Mindy Kaling is ugly and unfunny. That is what an opinion is.

@iriyabran,"kirikakirikakirika I personally didn't feel bored while watching it. It covered lots of years of their life after all. Idk maybe it's just the effect of the entire movie industry nowdays that has made me more tolerant. Like for example Nolan movies. You can give this guy permission to make a 10h long movie and it will still feel unexplored and unfinished and yet painfully stale and boring. The only movie of his I genuinely enjoyed was The Prestige. The rest is just overhyped and overpraised. Even Inception got painfully boring during the snowy part. Anyway I do agree that some movies get a lot more attention than they deserve and some deserve more attention but seem to appeal to a minority. I am a huge fan of The Fountain which seems terribly underrated and the recent Cloud Atlas which I barely read anything about since people at that time were going crazy about popcorn superhero movies. And usually the excuse I hear about those movies are ""oh shut up they're made for fun, we're just having fun"" which implies that if a movie is made for fun it's somehow totally exempt from criticism and it's totally ok to spend millions of dollar for it while some people are actually trying to make movies with a soul and get shot down terribly.",10년 전,0,
@iriyabran,"***** Oh hipster. I see that word thrown around so much I don't even know what it really mean. Cloud Atlas is by far not an average movie. Just the make up quality deserves a ton of acknowledgement. Superhero movies in general have been overdone for what, 12 years or more. It's gotten to a point where they don't even care to properly introduce the characters and their universe to the  audience which is not already part of the fanbase cause they're gonna make enough money off that fanbase anyway.Ofc he's gonna be critically acclaimed. There's nothing else to be acclaimed. International movies have been catching up fast and doing better.",10년 전,0,

@annebeaudoin5458,"Fredde, a British accent doesn't exist. Britain is comprised of 4 countries: England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. And within each country, there are a variety of accents. So, which British accent exactly are you referring to? Just by saying he has a ""British"" accent you're basically confirming he can mimic many. You may not like or appreciate Gary Oldman, which is fine, but he does quite a few accents well.",11년 전,4,
@froseo9,Clearly Anne i'm more thinking of the sterotypical accent you think of when thinking about brittain. like central london or something like that. Maybe you're brittish your self so you dont know  what i mean. But when you're foregin we kind of have a sterotypical brittish accent that you think of when you say someone has a brittish accent,11년 전,5,
@annebeaudoin5458,"Fredde I'm Canadian. And I understand that many people say ""British"" accent. But most people use the word British to mean English (from England), but it's not a synonym. You wouldn't say British to mean Scottish, Irish or Welsh normally. And unfortunately it shows one's ignorance (not YOU specifically, but everyone who uses the term). We don't know what we don't know, right? So I thought I'd mention it in case you were willing to learn something new. Many people would take offence since accents are actually very distinct. It's like telling a Canadian or Mexican they have an American accent. We are from the Americas, so we are American... but we're not from the United States (which calls itself and is known as America, which is a whole other topic of conversation). Just as if you (assuming you are from the U.S.) might be put off if you were told you have a Canadian accent because it's all part of the Americas, and it's all the same, right? You, too, might take offence. Maybe. And this note certainly is not meant to offend you in any way, just sharing a wider perspective on the subject. If you don't care... no worries.

Why would they be famous and on TV if they had no talent? Those people have no idea how hard u work to sing,act or get up on a stage in front of 10000000 people and make jokes that might be very embarrassing. I love everyone that is famous, and nobody can change that. Be proud of who u are and don't feel bad about what people say about u. Just be u no madder what people say. I hope people listen to this cause they are the ones who don't understand what kind of amazing talent that u have. Don't let people hurt u just because.

@Perola34,"thekillers1stfan my take on Kit is that Jon Snow is such an internal character. He is always in his thoughts. In the books it's less boring because you actually read his thoughts but on screen..it's kinda tough to portray Jon Snow, a guy that is tortured on the inside but has learned as a North man and noble bastard to have this kind of cold dignity that all Stark have on his face. He is the ""suffer in silence- i'm emo but all in the inside"" kind of guy. I should see other things Kit as played in to be able to see if it's him as an actor or his portrayal of Jon. You get what I mean ? :)",11년 전,42,

@medley-muffin6766,"We all have opinions but some of the twitter comments and some of the comments even here on YouTube are way to harsh and cold. In my opinion, we are allowed to say who we hate and why we hate them but it must make sense on why you hate a person, you just can't say you hate a person because they smell like cat wee when they don't. You have to have knowledge of something done wrong by that person before saying why you hate a person. For example, I hate One Direction-their songs always seem to be about girls and in 'What Makes You Beautiful' they state that looks are more important then characteristics, I also hate One Direction for choosing 23rd of November as their 'One Direction Day' because that is the same day as Doctor Who's 50th anniversary, and more it just makes them look like they want the centre of attention.  However, I have more reasons to hate Justin Beiber-he is rude to his neighbours by driving drunk up motorways and throws eggs at his neighbours outdoor products. Not only that but he called one of the most famous holocaust victims a big fan of his, instead of saying how horrible it was for the Jews. ",11년 전,0,
@ShellyKRowland,"I am in no way a huge One Direction fan, but my step-daughter is obsessed with them and there are no lyrics in that song that give even the slightest impression that looks are more important than anything. In fact they say  ""You're insecure, Don't know what for, You're turning heads when you walk through the door, Don't need make-up, To cover up, Being the way that you are is enough""  and their song ""Little Things"" is all about loving a girl even with her flaws.  Why hate them just because they happen to choose November 23rd for 1D day? I doubt they did it on purpose! They really are very sweet young men. I have NO defense for Justin though, never really cared for him and now he seems to be nothing more than an arrogant prick.",11년 전,1,

@twilightaddict1ful,I just sometimes don't understand why people say such fucked up things like that. would they really say that to the person's face if they were face to face with them. I think not. I think that they are all fucking awesome and hot. I may not always like some one but I don't think I would want to put it all over the internet. I think that people that say crap out celebrities are morons and ass holes. not that some things can't be taken as a joke but it can cut deeply.,11년 전,0,

You say the bible gives us lessons yes that is true but a lot of christians decide on those lessons to fit their ideal life style, I have come across numerous cases where a mother wont give her child medicine because she thinks  god wanted us natural while they live in a city life style, buying commericalised product and using products made from science, its a load of crap. Christianity has brought out the good and the worse out of people and sadly the worse outways the good, and one man was a christian and thought his views were righteous, that was Adolf Hitler quote from him , “I am convinced that I am acting as the agent of our Creator. By fighting off the Jews I am doing the Lord’s work.” you can say all you want about him and deny about it by saying hes a mad man but he got his ideals from Christianity and it wasnt the first time it has happened before.

We all know that its quite impossible to re-imagine characters when actors have taken up their names. Me being able to do that means something.

Good thing GOF was good, because it got a lot of people reading; including me.   No one asked for a cover to cover replication, simply a good adaptation. I believe the readers would appreciate if the show did justice, and the viewers would also benefit if they liked the show enough to read the books. ",11년 전,0,
@jeynalim,"***** Blasphemy! How dare you say the TV series is better than the book? Haha! You are a rare case man. The books have so much more depth and the political arena is much more intense. What one sees on screen is only half of what's going on.  Anyway, I think most people/readers of The Hunger Games would agree that that film was well adapted and it did justice to the book. If 'good adaptations' is really subjective, then having so many agreeing that THG was well adapted is quite impossible right? There is definitely a basis on judging an adaptation in labeling good or bad. It's the same as judging a film. ",11년 전,0,

Whatever it is, you cannot say BIrdemic is awesome while 12 Angry Men is bad based on preference, because obviously one is way better than the other.

So if  you strongly dislike two different people, both based on their actions, and you happen to have personally met one but not the other, it seems fairly arbitrary to say that you can only hate the one you've personally met. You dislike them both equally based on the same considerations; the way they act. You might say that the difference is that your information about the person you've never met may be inaccurate or incomplete in an important respect, but that's a possibility not a certainty and you could also be wrong about someone you have met anyway.  ",11년 전,0,
