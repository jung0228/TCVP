@AbroadinJapan,"I MENTIONED I travelled with some friends for two weeks; the total cost of our accommodation and transportation came in at £530 ($690) each.  On top of this we spent at least another £600 each on food/drink, as it was their first time to Japan and they wanted to splash out and try everything. So in total around £1100 for the two weeks (NOT including their return flights to Japan from the UK).  IF you have any budget travel wisdom, please share away below!",8년 전(수정됨),5.1천,

Another interesting thing is that with English being taught in school, children and young adults want to test their English skills on you. They are also very curious of the outside world and want to learn more about it.

Anyway, when I addressed him using keigo (very polite Japanese), as one should when addressing elders in Japan, he was shocked and hastily excused himself.

Both of these costs could have dropped if I walked more (I was already doing 10+ miles a day on foot) and I was at times buying snacks/etc. If you really wanted to ball on a budget, you could do Tokyo for a week for 650 USD round trip (with layover/connection I just flew into Tokyo from Newark for 750 round trip in the middle of July via Air Canada) and allocate 75 dollars a day for food, hostel/capsule or airbnb and public transit.

I managed to travel for 3 months from Okinawa to Sapporo spending ¥400,000 or $4000 for the whole time including food Accomodation travel and tourist attractions (starting and ending in Yamaguchi so this includes flights from/to there) The south (Kyushu and Okinawa) is much cheaper than the North because they have cheaper and more choice of hostels and a fantastic bus system so I spent half of the time there and the other half traveling the main island and Hokkaido in the North I bought multiple Seishun 18 Kinpu (a ticket for local trains which you can use  in the main tourist/holiday seasons) and traveled that way which is good to do if you have a little more time to travel as it can take sometimes 3 times longer to get somewhere rather than using the Shinkansen but it's great to use if you want to go to multiple places on the same day along a specific route (make sure to avoid the rush hour if you're traveling with a backpack or everyone will hate you)",8년 전,2,

@saldiven2009,"@CammWatts: Remember that the JRPass also gets you in the majority of the commuter trains in the bigger cities like Tokyo and Osaka; that's a real convenience to not have to figure out the correct ticket price to purchase rather than just being admitted to the station. Using those trains to get around will eat several dollars every day. Also, the JRPass tickets come in one week durations (7-day, 14-day, 21-day). The cost for a 7-day JRPass is almost identical to the price of a round trip shinkansen ticket from Tokyo to Osaka. So, you only need one decent sized side trip each week to more than pay for the cost of the pass. But, if you're going to get a pass, I'd advise making the most of it. We're planning a two week trip to Japan next year where we'll spend a week based in Tokyo and a week based in Osaka. We're planning day trips to Fuji, Nagano, Himeji, Hiroshima, Kyoto, etc., not counting the round trip between Tokyo and Osaka.

JR Tours will let you know what the cheapest rates are for however many nights you will be staying anywhere, can reserve the place for you, and give you a map to get there.  That said, I do recommend the business hotels, as I can't sleep on a moving vehicle.    Also, when you buy food at a convenience store, they will often ask you if you want it warmed.

Two bedrooms with comfy futons, a nice living room, washing machine again, small kitchen... Shop around on booking sites and you can get excellent deals.

@1983simi,"Me and my husband just recently finally got to go to Japan albeit just for 12 days and we only stuck to Tokyo and Kyoto, because we rather wanted to chill at fewer places than spending most of our time commuting to destinations and changing Hotels. We went off season and didn't find our trip any more expensive than doing city trips to any other larger cities. We were quite surprised the trip turned out a lot less expensive than we had expected.  We opted for budget hotels at around 80 to 90 Euros a night, both quite central and perfectly connected via metro. If we had been still in our 20s we might have gone for even cheaper options (hostels and capsules) which were also available in plenty around our travel time (late November, early December). But in your late 30s you kind of appreciate a bit more privacy and can afford it. We used the JR Rail pass for our commute from and to Narita. You are right, that airport is a pain to get to and from, but with NEX which is included in the JR pass it was both easy and comfortable and the flights to Narita were a whole lot cheaper than to Haneda. As we were also planning to go to Kyoto via Shinkansen (Hikari line is also covered by JR Rail Pass) it fit together perfectly that way. As for commuting within cities we got ourselves two Welcome Suica cards at the airport (I think this tourist version is pretty new) and charged 5000 yen on each of them. We used it extensively both in Tokyo and Kyoto and still had each 1000 yen left at the end of our trip, so we could have even charged it with less. We only used cabs four times, that is to get from Tokyo/Kyoto station to our Hotel and back with our luggage and our hotels were always close enough that it was never more than 2000 yen. As for food, it was literally just like European prices, you go for pricey food you get a 100 Euro bill, you go for down to earth cheap food you get a 15 euro bill. Towards the end we really tried hard to spend our coin that we had brought along in cash on souvenirs and gifts, unwilling to exchange our yen back and lose more in the process. We still ended up taking quite a few bills back home with us. Now we're saving them in hopes we'll get to go to Japan some time again.  Seriously, we live in Mumbai, I am originally from Munich, we also lived in San Francisco and Santiago de Chile before, also we traveled to Paris, Madrid, London, New York and other comparable cities. At least as long as you stick to well connected bigger cities Japan is really not more expensive than any other bigger city worldwide. Frankly, as for food we felt prices were on perfectly European level. Mumbai and San Francisco can be way more expensive in that regard. Commuting was easily cheaper than Munich both with cab or metro. Hotel prices also were on average European level. But again, mind we came really off season. I am sure for Hanami and the likes you'll be shelling out triple for accommodation. Else it really depends on how high you want to spend. If need be you can eat very cheap (like Ramen was a go to for us, cheap and fills you up good. wouldn't recommend every day though or your arteries will scream in agony).  Anyway, for the longest time in my mind Japan was a travel destination I felt was too expensive for me, cause that's the image created about it. But seriously the biggest part was the flight itself, rest all was just like any other bigger city trip.",5년 전,0,

@RaynmanPlays,"""Use these third party booking sites to book a room at a hotel!"" Me, who works reservations in a hotel: Eye twitch     For the record, it's not lost commission or anything like that. It's the extra work and constantly dealing with reps from these sites calling in with broken English to extract promises out of me that they know I can't promise instead of e-mailing us like their company policy says they have to. And that's not to mention the hassle if you get unlucky and your reservation gets cancelled because the site gives the hotel a bad card or if you want specific accommodations (like two beds) because those sites will screw you on that more often than you realize.  Use these sites to find a good hotel, and then book directly with the hotel. If the hotel has a site, it's usually cheaper and better to book on the site than calling. Bonus points if they (like the hotel I work at) have a price match program for those third party sites.",3년 전(수정됨),1,

Went to museums, the Osaka Aquarium, climbed Mt. Takao, visited Kenrokuen in Kanazawa, archery in Hiroshima, went to gaming arcades, ate so many tasty snacks, bought back an extra suitcase of souvenirs and treats. I got a cool purple PS4 controller that you can't get in Australia. Someone once told me that in order to have a good time, you'd need to spend $500 a day?! Nonsense! Pick the big things you want to do before you go, and be smart about what you buy. Just walking and exploring is entertaining.

Chris is man with all the savings ideas but another one I did was rent a karaoke room for 20 dollars all night and turn everything off and pass out. The last tip, if you are traveling light just keep your stuff in the train station lockers this way you’re not worrying and carrying all your stuff all the time.  There was also a time in Roppongi where a lady of the night came up to me and offered services, but I said I am just looking for a place to crash.

@redfish337,"Shinkansen view is fine. Nothing spectacular- mostly fields and scattered houses, some towns and cities- if you're lucky you can see Fuji... can also get a glimpse of Himeji if you pass Osaka on to Hiroshima. The newer ones have more tunnel segments since they favor investing the money to just blow through a mountain in a straight line. But overall it's just a pleasant view of fields and scattered homes.  There are fairly full videos out there: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0FK0Ax-XDQ Can skip through to see the sort of stuff there is to see.  Since the shinkansen favors speed it's of course going to take fairly straight routes in open areas. The slower liner style trains and such up in the mountains have nicer views if it's a matter of views.  But it sounds like your point is you're trying to get somewhere and it's just a matter of choice.  The shinkansen is pleasant for all sorts of reasons. Space, leg room. Where the stations are actually located. How easy it is to use. It's a pleasant trip. Get a nice view. Sneak a little nap in. And you might even feel like you even got a little boost of energy from the trip.  The plane is cheaper. If you go past the distance from Tokyo to Osaka, the plane starts to be faster. It can be a lot faster for the longest of distances. But you have to go through this big hassle of going to the airport, checking in, taking a short little flight, then going from the airport to downtown again. Aside from Fukuoka, the airports are pretty far out. The whole experience of a bunch of short segments is tiring.  The shinkansen you just go from city center to city center. Hop on, and relax in one place for the whole trip. And then you're at the other city center.  Shinkansen (and various ways of using it), bus, and plane all have their pros and cons though, so it's just a matter of what you want.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@midknight1978,"i travelled to japan 22 times... usually i stay there for 3 to 4 weeks. 1st time i went i spent around 7000 dollars...now as im used to it i spend an average of 3300 dollars. the thing is that you need to experience it couple of times till you find your sweet spot. the most expensive stuff i found are shopping (dont go near expensive brands as theyre much more expensive than europe or middle east). alternatively, use their brands as they are really really good. especially beauty stuff and food. second, taxis (avoid them as much as possible). third use jr pass ONLY if youre travelling to many long range cities (usually 3 or more). forth, try to avoid hotels at the HEART of the city centre as it gets much cheaper as you go further (there are many nice hotels with cheaper fares). fifth, for the bullet trains (shinkansen), do not use green cars as they are way expensive. sixth, there are much cheaper stuff in asakusa jump shops than ordinary shops. make sure to visit them first. seventh, pre book your activites as they are slightly cheaper. eighth, japan tends to be cheaper as you go away from tokyo or osaka. for example hokkaido is cheaper than tokyo. these are the tips i got in top of my head so far. extra: if you like hiking and stuff, visit explore-shareDOTcom. their rates are much cheaper.",4년 전,21,

That is a real option, and it will make the total cost of food go down because you can buy that 10kg of meat for barely anything per kg, because there are so many people. Thereby reducing the cost per person.  I know people living like that.  Then we had me in Japan, I did spend 20000yen each day for 10 days.

@AmbientWalking,"My de-facto cheapo strategy when I was living in Tokyo was to head to any of the numerous 'Yayoi Ken' restaurants and order the cheapest 'ichiju sansai', a set meal (which is either grilled miso mackerel or deep fried chicken) with unlimited top ups (it's self service, so don't feel shy) of plain, white rice. I would basically fast till as long as I can till about 3-4 pm (there was once I hit a 6 pm record, but it was the summer and I did nothing but hang out at Tower Records listening to records) and head to Yayoiken and eat 6 bowls of rice or something. It's immensely fulfilling for a mere 590 yen. The meal will last you an entire day. Comes with free cold unlimited green tea, pickles and miso soup too. It gets pretty packed during rush hours, but at other times, you can sit there as long as you wish without anyone bothering you, which basically means you can eat as much rice as you like. Some of these branches (like the one in Ginza, several in Shinjuku) are open 24 hours!!!!! That's insanely awesome!!! : )",4년 전(수정됨),62,

A fellow traveller I met whilst in Japan said that he never waited for more than 3 minutes before someone picked him up, and while their english wasn't the best, they were always super nice. In fact: it seems to be that Japanese people are much more likely to pick up a foreigner hitchhiking than they are to pick up Japanese people doing the same.",4년 전,0,

If you wanted to, I am confident you could get away with under $10 a day on meals, even if you tend to eat a lot. Of course, you are going to be tempted by all kinds of other stuff too, especially if you are traveling.

If you‘re gonna mainly stay in one major area and only plan on doing a day or two trip to say Kyoto, Hiroshima, Tokyo etc don’t get the rail pass. But if you plan on going to a lot of different places then yeah get the pass.  Also make sure to get the Japan official travel app, it’s free and amazing.

@alannilla,"Thank you so much for your tips Chris! Me and my best friend finally went to Japan after wanting to go since middle school and we never thought it would be possible. We worked minimum wage only a few hours every week at the time we were saving up to go and going to university full time. However, we saved enough for 2 weeks during May-June to fully enjoy Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka and still have money left over afterwards!  We bought loads of souvenirs (Harajuku's Takeshia Dori and also Don Quijote had the same souvenirs/gifts super cheap, same for Kyoto and Osaka just go to the more local stores rather then the ones full of tourists).  We tried all kinds of delicious food - local restaurants in the more suburban areas were amazing and also affordable for us broke college students for dinner/lunch. 7-Eleven and the vending machines are you new best friends for food throughout most of the day). I even lost weight, not for starving lol - we ate a lot - but for how healthy/cheap the food was and how much we walked around. The most fun moments we had were the one's we surprisingly spent little money like hikes (Fushimi Inari trail is beautiful once you get past the first 100 tori gates gates of tourism traffic hell) and just wandering around the streets/parks of Japan (definitely recommend the extra yen for the Sanso's garden at Arashiyama, one of the most peaceful walks I've had in my life and you can see the entire Arashiyama bamboo grove from there; also Hello Kitty world was incredibly fun too at least for me and I say the price for the ticket was worth it and seeing the Parade and exploring the town the theme park is at afterwards is awesome too). If you're from the US (my bff is) the dollar is amazing but if you're from Canada like myself everything is about the same price as it is here - sometimes cheaper!! Definitely saved money by buying lunch/snacks at convenience stores, Airbnb (couldn't try out the capsule hotel but plan to next time), and going to the ""free"" tourist traps or choosing them wisely hehe. We didn't get the JR pass since we figured it would be cheaper for us to get the regular Pasmo card for where we were going those 2 weeks and just bought the tickets to Kyoto and Osaka separately; if you're going all the way to Hiroshima or further areas then JR is a good investment. Also book the flights early and you'll get so much cheaper discounts (remember to delete cookies from your browser as the websites catch them and raise flight prices)! Definitely want to go back soon now that I know it's possible :) (This is so long I'm sorry ;;)",5년 전,19,

@vcalblas,"4 years ago my ex-girlfriend and I spent 3 months travelling around Japan. We did it very low budget. We hitchhiked everywhere. It turned out Japanese people loved to have us in their car. They were very nice in general. It was hard to have a conversation though, as they hardly understood English and we din't speak Japanese. But guess what? If you got your hands to gesture with and a friendly smile you don't really need to speak the same language. We had a small 2-person tent with us in our backpacks. We camped in forests, city parks and... well... anywhere really. It was wonderful, and we never felt unsafe. Japan is the safest place in the world. Another great thing: Japan had many (very clean) public toilets, which offered a way to wash ourselves in the morning. We ate a lot of onigiri from the convenience stores. We sometimes ate at the Japanese fast food places like Matsui. Of our 3 months we spent 1 month in Tokyo, volunteering at a hostel. We had to do the beds and clean the place for 4 hours a day, 5 days a week. In return they gave us free accommodation and free lunch. We also spent a couple of weeks volunteering for an oyster farmer in Kumihama Bay. In return he gave us free accommodation and 3 excellent meals a day. They were a lovely family. If I have to guess what our average spendings were, I would say not even 5 euros a day. (Not including flights.) It does include entrance fees to a couple of museums (like the ones about the atomic bombs in Nagasaki and Hiroshima). It also includes a nicer meal every now and then, like sushi. And it includes some unforgettable nights at karaoke places and a few refreshing onsen visits. Sure, we did our trip in Japan on a low low low budget, but thanks to our hitchhiking we met hunderds of Japanese people. We spent our nights in our tent often surrounded by nature. We spent 1 month in one of the most expensive cities in the world, Tokyo. If we hadn't travelled the way we did it, we would have spent our entire budget after two weeks. Now we got to spent 3 months in that great country - AND it made our experience a whole lot better! I hope my little story inspires others who also don't have a lot of budget, but who want to see Japan badly, to go there anyway. :-)",5년 전,2.3천,

I live in the Nederlands now, and there was a time when I had to leave my current acomodation, but failed to secure a new one. I changed provinces, got myself a job, but failed to get a room. So I deposited most of my stuff with friends, bought myself a hammock, sleeping bag, and additional survival stuff as I went on, learning from my mistakes. I worked mixed hours, it was not always busy enough to keep us around full time, but I worked plenty. They had cameras in bicycle shed, so no one tried to steal my stuff while I was at work. I charged my phone and 3DS there, I went to the gym almost every day to take showers, I used friends or dedicated establishments for laundry, stayed in KFC if I wanted internet, and slept in parks, forests, on the beach, basically whenever, and would cycle everywhere or take trains. I spend 7 months living this way, and I was healthy like a bull - not even a cold even if I stood shirtless in rain at 5am, and because I was on the move all the time and used the gym so often I got ridiculously buff and ripped, and saved up like 2k euro in the process lol.",5년 전,92,

I stock up on housewares, gifts and seasonal items at Daiso. Very high quality. DonKee is more expensive, but steeply discounted, like an Armani down jacket for $60USD.

@melissagreen7327,"I traveled to Japan a couple years ago and did it for around 4000USD (that includes my flight which was roundtrip 1000USD from the US). I actually used AirBNB for my boarding option as I don't like hostels or public spaces. I spent about $30 a night for a apartment in Oyama when I was in Tokyo and around the same for an apartment in Osaka in Shin-Osaka which factored out to being not all that much for two weeks in Japan since both AirBNB locations had a discount for stays longer than four nights.  I DID spend out for the JR pass and if you want to get somewhere fast, I think it's well worth the money. As I was able to take the Shinkansen between Tokyo and Osaka in three hours and then I could take the shinkansen (normally about 1500 yen a ticket to do it that way) from Osaka to Kyoto and get there in about 15 minutes which was great considering I spent about three days going from Osaka to Kyoto and it was also easier for travel to Himeji, Nara, and other surrounding areas. So in my personal opinion for comfort and convenience I think the JR pass is well worth the expense especially outside of Tokyo where you might get stuck using subway lines which the JR doesn't cover.   I don't think there really a way to budget temples and sites. I think that's just going to end up costing what it costs, but spending out the yen to see castles and temples is well worth it. Honestly, I think I spent out more on sightseeing then I did on food. I'm partial to grocery stores and combinis and if you AirBNB you could find a location directly in front of a store like I did which meant quick cheap food was literally five minutes away.  I spend so much time telling my friends Japan is NOT as expensive as they think but they never seem to believe me. I have friends that want to save up 10000USD or more and I tell them honestly, it's not that expensive but...what are you going to do?",5년 전,19,

@TheoLubbe,"1. ""cheapest long-haul destination"" I don't know how this could possibly have been imagined into being. Cheapest 'high-end' destination, maybe, but far from the cheapest overall. Cambodia as example is still long-haul for Europeans/Americans and is markedly cheaper in all respects.  South Africa, where I was born and have lived my entire life besides spending ~52 days in Japan and ~10 days in Namibia (and ~2 days in Dubai's airport for transfers), is also markedly cheaper in general.  14GBP for a hostel in Asakusa/Ueno is equivalent to R262 (South African) by today's exchange rate.  At the time your video was made, hostel stays in Cape Town would cost you from R175 for shared dorm style. 'Cat and Moose Backpackers' is an example.  49GBP for a hotel room is ~R920. Hotel rooms of equivalent quality here start from around R500 in the heart of the city.  2. Cost comparison of rail pass, overnight busses etc  Overnight busses also have the additional cost of having to find separate bathing facilities and make use of coin lockers (or having a travel companion watch the luggage...) as opposed to being able to make use of your hotel room's or hostel's bathing facilities for what may well be free (many hostels/backpackers use coin-operated showers). In some cases, laundry will also either be free or so inexpensive as to be basically-free, with the additional benefit of access to tumble-drying facilities in many places. Else, you've either got to tote around a lot more clothing unnecessarily, or go about potentially being smelly (and Westerners tend to smell a lot more and more pronouncedly to Japanese people than other Japanese people do) and sticky from sweat+humidity depending on when, where and how you're traveling.  A night bus also doesn't afford you the luxury of leaving your luggage in your room during daytime excursions, so you've once again either got to find and make use of coin locker facilities, or tote your luggage around with you everywhere you go...  It is, definitely, a great option if you're specifically planning on changing location between Tokyo and Kyoto as example though, since you can 'skip' an evening's accommodation in a hotel where you showered in the morning and did things in the area during the day where toting your luggage didn't matter as much (post check-out from the hotel), then check in at your next destination's hotel to drop your luggage off not too long after arrival the next morning.  Some business hotels (and other 'regular' hotels) include a breakfast buffet or a pre-determined meal for the price thouogh; Wingport Hotel in Nagasaki (very close to the main train station) is/was an example of this. You could thus effectively cut 1,000jpy or more out of your daily meal requirements by having breakfast there, as opposed to having to buy something from a convenience store or finding a place to eat where time might get taken up unnecessarily by having to wait for your meal to be prepared off a menu.  A JR Pass also allows you to easily and quickly visit many disparate locations which could very quickly rack up on your travel expenses otherwise. For my trip with the 21-day and 14-day passes I had, if I had to have bought tickets individually for the places I could reach with the passes instead it would have quickly cost me at least 50% more than my passes cost me for the local trips (factoring in the bullet trains' cost.  3. 'eating on the cheap' I had a few different of Yoshinoya's meals, including beef bowls and their liver and cabbage bowl.  For the price, R46 by current exchange rates (350jpy), you can get a larger meal from a KFC or Burger King (or similar) here in South Africa. Yes, it's not going to be as 'home meal' in appeal, but it's going to be a more substantial meal which won't leave you feeling as-hungry for the price.  Many business hotels in Japan have free-to-rent ('rent' because you've got to go collect it from reception and take it back to them after) cooking utensils and kitchenware. This can allow you to prepare your own lunch if you're not specifically aiming to try out a wide variety of Japanese meals (meals, not snacks). Something which can also save you huge amounts of money, since you can get rice for extremely little and dry, it's compact and lightweight for what it cooks to if you buy a 1kg bag and don't use up all of it 'at once'.  The izakaya option for places with nomi/tabihoudai is great though. If you don't travel alone, in which case... not so great.  As for the onigiri and 'bento packs', something a lot of people don't know is many (and I mean but many) of the convenience stores through the country will 'rotate out' their old stock of fresh foods like these, and in the process of doing so mark down at progressively greater rates the 'old' stock of fresh food items.  A tuna onigiri which could normally cost 180jpy as example can easily be had for as little as 70jpy if you come in just before the next batch of stock is meant to go on the shelves. There's nothing wrong with it, it's still entirely fresh, it just needs to get off the shelves for the new stock...  That said, if you're just going to have plain 100jpy onigiri, just get some nori and rice and prepare your own in your hotel... then you can not only have them substantially cheaper, but also much more interesting/tastier. Just practise making them at home before going over. That, or to make things easier, get a partitioned lunchbox and prepare yourself meals into that instead.  Beer from vending machines can sometimes be had for 150jpy or less for 500ml. Vending-machine hunting for bargains should be part of every visitor's activities; if you're passing a vending machine, at least give its prices for something you'd get a glance if you either want that then, or will be coming back by it later.",5년 전,2,

Also managed to live for that 1.5 months for 2000 dollars, went to Kyoto, stopped at a cheap Ryokan, went to disneyland, and did all sorts of things with that small budget (Though it would've been nice to have more money, as I didn't quite reach all the places I want to go to).

@redfish337,"Shinkansen is by far the most comfortable. Also by far the easiest. And you pay for it.  There are pros and cons to night buses, flying and shinkansen (JR pass, pay as you go Nozomi or platt kodama). If you're a tourist with time and money, shinkansen is usually the best overall option. The exception being very long plane routes such as Osaka to Sapporo. If you take a plane or a bus, you feel like you've traveled. That's not the case with the shinkansen. There's almost no wear and tear on you from the trip. Frankly, with a little luck you can get a good nap in and end up more rested. So even though it costs more and shinkansen only operate during daylight hours (ie, useful touring time), it leaves you in much better condition and so I prefer it. But.. expensive.",5년 전,1,

@anima099,"For food:  In the morning, skip the big breakfast and just go all out with a previously hard boiled egg (you boil yourself the night before) and a good cup of coffee. Feel free to add a rice ball to make the fullness last longer. I don't know the cost of a single piece of fresh egg in the supermarket, but it can't be more than 30 Yen. A good cup of coffee can be one of them instant coffees or ready to brew ones from convenience stores. You can buy in bulk and one cup shouldn't cost more than 100 yen. One rice ball can cost up to 150 yen. So, you have yourself a power breakfast at less than 300 yen.    Then, just make do with a really heavy lunch at around 1 PM or so. Splurge on lunch, probably 1000 yen if you're into big yet reasonably priced meals that's good for two. For context, the famous Ichiran 5 at Ichiran Ramen costs 1500 yen if I recall plus one free ramen refill. That pretty good until the next day if you eat past 2 pm.   If you get hungry past 6, buy yourself a 350 yen meal at 7-11, FamilyMart, or Lawson, or during the evening sale at Don Quijote's food floor where every food is either 50% off or buy 1 take 1.   That's a max 1500 yen per day in Japan or about 500 yen per meal per person which is quite a lot for most people. If you're not really a big eater, you can get that down to 1000 yen or so. In dollars, 1500 Yen is like $15.00 You get to fill your belly at $15.00 a day. If you're a big guy or girl, and you're used to spending upwards of $20 per day on food, you will not be hungry anywhere in Japan.    For travel, I don't really recommend the JR passes unless you're going to be literally only using JR lines. The really good places in Tokyo, Osaka, and Sapporo often make use of Subways which the passes don't work with. Not to mention the amount of walking you'll be doing in some of them will make you want to spend a bit more for subways anyway. If you don't mind walking, then you can make the JR passes work wonders, especially in Tokyo and Osaka and their respective surrounding cities. If you're staying for ten days minimum, and you're going to change prefectures halfway (i.e. Tokyo to Osaka), then perhaps the bullet train pass can work. Plus points if you use the bullet train again, and again, and again within the same travel week.    For most tourist, they only use the bullet train once per week if they ever do since each prefecture has a lot of places to visit.",5년 전(수정됨),3,

@kapamaru,"I just came back from Japan. I stayed there for 16 days, only hostels and capsules. To give a pretty good example, the best capsule hotel was in Kobe, right at the station and I was able to book a night for 1700 yen (about a month before I went) instead of 3000 that was the standard price. The hostels were about 1500 - 2000 per night, depending on the area. In Kyoto and Osaka it was a bit cheaper, the most expensive one was in Tokyo. I also stayed in Hamamachutso and Akihabara for the same price more on less. Skipped the JR pass and travel with the night buses (about 70 euros for a round trip) and that way I also skipped a couple of night at a hostel. I chose all the hostel locations to be in walking distance (about 30 mins) from where I wanted to go, in order to save on buses and metro. Unfortunately due to  circumstances I had to ride more buses and metro than I thought (rain, typhoon, phone battery dying), but my mentality was correct. For food I realized that the cheap options (like 7eleven) are only a bit cheaper than ramen or small restaurants, so I ate mostly at them, occasionally cup noodles and sushi. Every time I found a big super market, the food and drinks were cheaper than the compini so I took advantage of that. For entertainment there is a ton of free things to do in Japan. Visiting temple, mountains, almost everywhere there was something free. Of course I had to pay for the most well known attractions (like golden pavilion) but even if I didnt visit those, I would still be feeling fulfilled.   With some careful planing, and maybe a bit of inconvenience you can still experience the full Japan package on a budget. I am Greek btw, so if I could do it, everyone can",6년 전,3,

If you are so poor you can't afford a room for 30 bucks a night you should probably question your vacation plans. And no I'm not rich that's why I don't go on vacation because I am smart and try to save my money or spend it on material things which remain in my possesion, not like a vacation where I spend 90% of my savings and come back with nothing but an empty bank account and some nice memories of my trip.

You just show your pass at the entrance ways to the platforms and off you go, simple as that.   I also second his recommendation of staying in Ueno, that's where I stayed and I thought that it was fairly centrally located for the Tokyo area.There's lots to see and do in the immediate area, plenty of restaurants all around both inside and outside the train station there. It's also really close to Akihabara as well as Harajuku and if you're into Pokemon, the Pokemon Cafe isn't all that far from there either.",6년 전,1,

I just wanted to know how much I would need to save up. I’ll probably be in Tokyo for the majority of the trip but I may want to visit Hiroshima. I was thinking with airfare being 2,100 round trip for both of us, and hotel, sightseeing for a week & a half, I was thinking 15K. What do you think?",6년 전,0,
@Riceball01," @NewYork4Life12  Well, I didn't pay for the trip all out of pocket myself, had help from my in-laws and my wife's ex, but I think that 15K should be more than enough. Your main expenses are hotel and airfare, food isn't too bad , and most sightseeing/tours don't cost a whole lot either particularly if you don't mind walking tours.   I'd recommend getting a Japan Rail Pass, this makes taking trains so much easier and you'll need to take the train to get from one part of Tokyo to another. I'd also be sure to set aside cash/money for taxi fare, you'll need to take the cab for some of the further parts of wherever  you're staying that might be too close to bother with taking a train.   Speaking of trains, all of the platforms have signs in English and inside the trains they'll have electronic signs above the doors that will alternate between Japanese and English and it will announce each stop in Japanese and English.This makes taking trains in Japan really easy once you figure out which train you need to take and which platform it's at.   One other thing I'd recommend is if your cell plan doesn't include roaming data for free or if your hotel doesn't provide with a phone to borrow then I'd get a Japanese SIM card for your phone when you get there.  Having data will allow you to look up train schedules, find places to eat and comes in very handy with taxis. Even when the driver doesn't speak English all you have to do is bring up where you want to go on Google Maps and show your driver your phone.",6년 전,0,

That means more business for people who live in Japan, even though things that are made in Japan don't cost any more for the Japanese people themselves.  The only bad part is that goods that are imported to Japan get more expensive for Japanese people.

@Wabibis,"It is and I can also highly recommend getting one, it makes things so much easier. You can use them in pretty much every train and bus in Greater Tokyo, you can even go to Yokohama from Tokyo with an IC card if you want to, just not with Shinkansen I think. Also limited express, express and green car aren't included so for example if you fly to Narita and want to use NEX, you have to buy a separate ticket. Suica and Pasmo can be used in most other cities too for example Kansai area (Osaka, Kyoto etc.) but you cannot go from Tokyo to Kansai with them because the area between them isn't included. You can check the coverage map online if you decide to go away from Greater Tokyo. Note that Tokyo has 3 major train companies: JR (for example Yamanote circle line), Tokyo Metro (the blue M logo, almost everywhere, hence my favourite) and Toei which isn't that big. You can use them all but if you have to change train to get to your destination and the next train is different company than the first one, there will be a small extra fee so if you want to save some money and if it's possible, try to plan your routes so that you only have to use one company on a single trip. Downloading a train line map of Tokyo to your phone helps a lot and you could always use hyperdia.com too to plan as long as there is an internet connection. Since I'm making so many recommendations already, I must say one more. Maps.me, it's available free for Android, it's basically an offline map app where you can download maps of entire areas, mark places you wish to visit and use it without internet to show where you are, navigate etc. for free because GPS doesn't cost anything. Saves the hassle of having a big paper map with you. I've used it in Japan, Thailand, Greece and UAE among others and it has saved me quite a few times already 😂",6년 전,0,

@borgarden2731,I ended up getting a 5k loan to travel to japan with around 5k already saved up to go there. The trick is to use companies like AIRBNB and have a solid idea of where you are going and what you are going to do. To be honest if you don't plan on learning any Japanese I would advise not to go until you at least know the basics. If you don't understand anything it becomes frustrating for you and whoever you are trying to talk to. Even the basic knowledge of language goes a long way and Japanese people be delighted in general to find out you know the basics of the language and will bend backwards to help you out. Can't wait to go back.,5년 전,4,

@JohnOhkumaThiel,"This is good for the ultra low budget traveler, but I’ll add one thing.  When you choose the cheapest, slowest form of transportation, consider the cost of incidentals like food and drink.  If you take a plane or bullet train, you’re basically flying between meals and sightseeing, but if you take buses or local trains you’re going to spend a lot more on crappy food, drinks, and generally just keeping yourself sane.  I do wish more people would try cycling through Japan because in my opinion it’s the best and cheapest way to see the country in its rural glory.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

If you are not food lover, you can save a lot of money, but if you wanna try real Japanese food, you’d better save money before you travel Japan🤔 Otherwise you will regret so much when you see the good food in Japan.

@hadesflames,"Just get an airbnb. You'll get the best value in terms of cost to privacy + living space and amenities. I went to Japan last year (2018) and paid $900 for an airbnb for 2 entire weeks. That's $64/night. More importantly, I went with a friend, which means we both stayed at the place. The price didn't change. In other words it was actaully $32/night per person. EXTREMELY cheap. The place was a private apartment, was relatively spacious (my friend and I were quite comfortable and had no complaints) had a host of amenities that a typical hostess/hotel/capsule hotel wouldn't have, had free wifi, free pocket wifi for when we left the apartment meaning we were always connected even when our cell phones wouldn't connect to roaming. We had a large screen TV. We weren't exactly in the heart of Tokyo but close enough to commute to anywhere in Tokyo quite quickly. Furthermore, the host was super helpful and would quickly respond to any questions about either the room, or the city we might have. You won't get that with any other place. There's no competing with the value you get from renting out someone's private apartment and dealing with a good host. There just isn't. Quite frankly I can't imagine any reason to NOT get an airbnb. It's surprising the video doesn't mention airbnb as an option. I have no idea why I would want to stay in a shitty hostell or capsule hotel when I can have an entire private apartment for a similar cost.",6년 전,0,

@HungryGuyStories,"You know, every J-vlogger says Japan is dirt cheap to live in.  But when I watch the videos, what people say blatantly contradicts the way the Japanese live.  For all their high-tech toilets and video games, other modern conveniences that we in the West take for granted are conspicuously missing in Japan: clothes dryers, dishwashers, central air conditioning, water heaters, etc.  Whole families have to share bath water for Gosh sakes!!!  That's disgusting!!!  The lowest caste member in the family comes out of the bath dirtier and smellier than when they went in!!!  And when it's cold, people sit snuggled around low tables with ""cold tattoos"" inside them, instead of, you know, turning up the thermostat.  Everyone drives itty-bitty cars, but okay, that's probably due to the narrow streets and lack of parking.      BTW, I'm not hating on you -- I'm a subscriber and I love your vids :-)   I'm just pointing out what I see as an obvious contradiction between what J-vloggers say and what I'm seeing...  A couple years ago, I asked a similar question on that Aussie bloke's channel.  I wasn't rude or anything -- I just asked matter-of-factly like here.

I stayed at the Rihga Royal Hotel in Hiroshima for 2 nights for a total of 90 euro (about 11000 yen at the time) a few years ago. Nagasaki and Nagoya were even cheaper. If you plan to stay a month or more you can look into long-term stays for low rates of about 18-20 euro a night.",6년 전,0,

@jpguthrie6669,"I should make a video about life in the MInato ward in Tokyo, and the cost of living  here. A 3LDK apartment, $8500 per month, plus another $700 in association fees, plus another $500 per month for a parking spot. Utilities, like gas, electricity, internet, and water, are about $400 per month. Car ownership? Figure $2000 per year for inspection, registration, road tax, and insurance. Gas is about $7 per gallon, getting halfway across the city will run about $20 in tolls. As for food, my usual rule-of-thumb computation is think about what I would pay for a steak, a potato, or container of milk in America, and multiply by 4.5 Have kids? Japanese schools suck,  but a good international school is some $40,000 per year, per kid, for tuition, activities, and transportation. Taxes? No matter what your income, you'll pay at least some income tax, at least $2000 per year in residency tax, and at least $2500 per year for the national healthcare plan. You get a large write off for kids, and kids get free medical treatment up to the age of 15, but what you save in healthcare and taxes is more than offset by the cost of food, which, in Japan, is also taxed.",7년 전,0,

We got home with probably 6 months supply of snacks and candy, some anime merchandise, a single ¥10,000 bill and some loose change. Ueno is indeed the cheapest district for lodging but we probably overspent, having actually rented an apartment and all. We lived off of walking for hours, eating ramen and sushi throughout the day and cooking our own breakfast (or taking a few discounted onigiri in the convenience store). Although we did eat at some restaurants, but I’m not sure if those were the cheap or relatively pricier ones.  The bullet trains are said to be expensive too, but really you’ll only need them if you want to go to other prefectures (or if you want to travel fast as fq as if you’re always running late to a meeting.)

@redfish337,"Anyway, I'll work in USD and you can convert back to NZD if it's convenient for you... currently it's about 1500 NZD to 1000 USD. In SHORT (with explanation to follow), it's 100 USD/day + long range travel + plane. So assuming you'll just be in Tokyo (or JUST Osaka/Kyoto, or JUST some other city), it's 30 x 100 USD + 1000 USD = 4000 USD = 6000 NZD Also, this assumes fairly basic accommodations I'd expect from a month long trip. Is 5000 NZD ENOUGH?  Possibly. But it's not enough to have available... you'll want access to more if needed. Frankly, even though I listed it at 6000 NZD, having another 500 NZD buffer minimum would be wise.  Some things to keep in mind: You're planning your trip very far in advance. I think you can do better than 1000 USD. Although I'm coming from a bigger hub, the distance is approximately the same. And while 1000 USD is a standard (summer) price, I can get it for less than half that if I check prices often. Even if you can't do that well, 1000 USD seems high for a trip planned this far in advance. Mind you I'm not really sure how they charge flights when you're going south to north hemisphere... but I still think that whatever price you think is normal with your research so far, that you can do better than that with regular price checking.  AirBnB is one of the best options, but it's going through a bit of a legal battle in Japan right now. How this turns out can heavily affect what sort of stuff you'll be able to get at a reasonable price. But with the two of you, you can rent out a private room in some hostels or get a room at a business hotel and it's not too bad. But if AirBnB can get things back in order you can do better for cheaper. Probably average 25-50 USD/night per person... but 20-40 USD outside Tokyo. AirBnB can get you better stuff for the low-mid end of that.  Transportation within Japan is very expensive. Like, within the cities, there are special tickets and while not cheap, they're still decent compared to a lot of other cities. BUT when you try to go far away to other cities, the price goes way up. Staying there a month it's likely you'd want to go to other places. This can get expensive. Bus is a reasonable option, and a night bus saves you paying for a night (but probably means you won't sleep, >__<). Rail pass is expensive... really, this cost is so variable that that is why I keep it separated from the other stuff.  AND then, back to the standard 100 USD/day recommendation.  This assumes 50 USD for basic lodging, BASIC food, transportation and wi-fi. And then 50 USD wiggle room to spend to upgrade your lodging or food, or have fun. So if you're spending much above 30 USD/day on lodging, it's either coming out of your fun fund, or you need to save up more. Food is just for basic fast food style stuff... upgrading past that is taking from the 50 USD.  And in general, it should average out. Touristy temple days and park days that cost almost nothing average out with shopping and expensive meals and it should come out to around 80-120 USD/day for a fun, vacation sort of trip where you can spend fairly freely but not extravagantly. That said, your personal tastes affect the total a lot too. If you're content with museums, parks, and shrines... 60 USD/day is possible.  But expensive tastes every day could run 120-200+ USD/day.  And that is an important point. Japan is a place where there is what amounts to the 1 USD option, the 3 USD, the 10 USD option and the 100 USD option for almost everything... you can get by fairly reasonably... or you can spend a fortune in a single day.

I think most people realise tattoos don’t have the same connotations around the world so you get a bit of a free pass as a foreigner.Having travelled through Japan with someone with tattoos it didn’t seem to pose any real issues on our trip. One thing to note though is that a lot onsen don’t allow tattoos, basically because they don’t want yakuza using it as a place to have meetings (which to my understanding is something that yakuza actually do). You can avoid this by having a private onsen, often available if you are staying at a ryokan, or go to a tattoo friendly onsen which are becoming more common.

This happened rather recently, so overturning the practice so soon would lose face for those who fought for it.  All in all,  you're fine.",7년 전,1,

Onomichi is JR. Note that if you don't actually need to go to Tokyo, there are some good regional passes that cover Osaka/Kyoto to Hiroshima, to Fukuoka. Alternatively, the airport is very convenient from Fukuoka, so if you wanted to go somewhere like Okinawa or Sapporo that can't be reached (or at least not easily in case of Sapporo) by train, it may be better to combine a regional pass with some cheap flights, rather than get the full JR pass.

A lot of jobs provide travel per diem for their employees... so really the taxi is just providing service at high cost to businessmen.  Is it expensive to party? Well, that, however, depends on you. Like many things in Japan, there are cheap and expensive versions of everything. There are all you can drink places for like 10 USD where you can totally have a good time with some friends.

Anyway, just a reminder that skateboards aren't common at all here so you bring a lot of attention to yourself. As you approach the downtown districts you should probably pick up your board and walk.

First trip, we did the rail pass, and it came out to be worth it, because the JR covered long distance travels (Tokyo to Kyoto) and sub city travel for the 7-day period. Airbnb was worth it, and you make a great point about staying ""somewhere interesting"".  2nd trip, no JR pass, since we stayed in Tokyo. Might have saved a bit buying a suica card, but we got buy just paying per trip.  We opted out of doing an airbnb, and ended up staying at a hotel, which turned out to be worth it, considering their breakfast buffet was included every morning.",7년 전,1,

@redfish337,"The main tourist districts and areas of major cities and attractions will have English available. As a general rule of thumb- most people can understand basic English, but are not confident to use it.  A small, but significant minority are. This means you can't reliably use English. But, if you're desperate, you can reliably find someone who can help you. As you get out to the countryside the English use will drop off significantly. But people in the countryside are less hurried and more willing to help despite having to go through hoops gesturing and whatnot to communicate. (You can get help in a city like Tokyo, but please try to ask people who don't look busy... they'll feel obligated to help you despite their rush, making the whole situation really uncomfortable). As for gestures... if that's all you have, then sure. But you really should learn basic courtesy words at the very least. You are MUUUCH more equipped with 100 words of vocab than with 0. And the helpfulness of learning more is of course logarithmic. 1000 words... even with no real understanding of grammar, and you can pretty much do anything short of get a job. If you have the time, 1 word a day will put you in very good position by the time you go. If you're just going once for not very long that' overkill and perhaps a waste of time though.

@redfish337,"Are you including flight? If so, it depends on where you're coming from.  The second most important thing is what sort of lodging you need.  You can airbnb a studio apartment for like... $50 each for a decently nice place.  And the third most important thing is where you want to go. Going to multiple far away cities means flights or shinkansen or a railpass (or... god forbid, a bus). This long distance domestic travel adds up fast.  So, it's a tentative yes. But just realize that there's pretty much the $5, $50, and $500 version of basically everything in Japan. If you're rolling in the $5 or $50 slots most of the time, you should be fine. But the high rolling opportunities are there, and will burn through budget fast. And again, travel expenses, if you're including them in the $3500, will vary by person a lot.",7년 전(수정됨),0,
@Big-Wonka,"redfish337 Thanks for the thorough reply. The $3500 was only for food, activities, and lodging. This was our tentative plan. We're going to fly out of Philadelphia into Tokyo. Stay there for 2-3 days. We were going to get the Japan rail pass to travel from city to city on the bullet train. So from Tokyo to Kyoto to Hiroshima. We'll probably stay 2-3 days at each place. I already accounted for all travel though. I hope that clears some things up. Thanks again for the reply.",7년 전,0,
@redfish337,"In that case, lodging, activities and food for 10 days can be done for $100 per person/day fairly easily which would only take $1000 or so. So a $3500 pace over 10 days would be quite extravagant.  Or not really, if you must insist on using regular hotels rather than airbnb/business hotels/hostels. Lodging is the biggest waste of money... Japan isn't a resort destination- you shouldn't be spending much time at the lodging. That said, if you do have this sort of budget, you can spend on 1-2 nights in a nice ryokan as a splurge lodging. Western hotels are world class, but again, you're not supposed to be sitting in your hotel all day in Japan. =P  Ryokan are at least an experience. If you can keep spending on that down you should be able to spend on pretty much anything else you'd want. Just for reference, NOT INCLUDING flight, I'd budget ~$1600/per person for literally everything else (including rail pass).... and have access to at least $2000 to have some buffer. Most stuff of interest to tourists in Japan really isn't very expensive. That's the ""careful with the boring stuff so I can spend on stuff I like"" budget.

You want to go to both Osaka and Hiroshima. You can claim one of your bus pass days, take a bus to Osaka early on, explore that day, and hop on a night bus to Hiroshima that night (so long as that bus leaves on the same day, it's considered just one day). The 5 day pass can literally save you hundreds of dollars (and you can also save more on your passes if you decide to only travel mon-thursday). Also the days are not consecutive, so if you only use the bus on, for example, the 3rd of the month, the 10th, and the 17th, that's fine.  If you're going to Japan on a serious budget, I would look into it!",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@redfish337,"Well, Japan isn't as good as say the USA where almost every place has unlimited soft drinks.  But it applies to a few places. For example, most family restaurants (essentially Japan's take on Denny's... Denny's exists too, but it's almost universally considered worse than all the competition)... have a drink bar with unlimited refills of soda... usually coffee/cappuccino/tea, and juice and occasionally some more exotic things. If you want to drink up, this is actually preferable because there's no time limit (occasionally ones near say, a campus, will post a sign against say, doing schoolwork). You can chat for friends with hours and drink all the cappuccino and melon soda you want.   The all you can eat places tend to have a timer. They will often offer a drink bar with sodas, or pay more for the alcoholic drink option.  Some places like an izakaya I don't think you can specify... you just pay a set amount for the time and it's priced as if you will mostly drink alcohol.",7년 전,0,

The advantage of going abroad is that well... the lower class and mundane is still exciting and special. And the advantage of Japan in particular is that it has a relatively high basic standard... cleanliness and safety are paramount, so even staying at some low end place in a  sketchy district to keep the cost down... it's just not going to be that bad. In the US, if you try to go too cheap (and that could still be expensive in a place like SF or NYC...) the place could very well be total %#^$# and you've probably got a pretty good chance to get mugged... forcing you to spend more to stay in a better place and area, and increasing the cost above the super low end stuff of Japan.",7년 전,1,

@redfish337,"If you're trying to keep the cost down, stay at places with showers. Hostels should all have them- airbnb should usually have them. Western style hotels will usually have individual shower/baths, but you'll find that Japanese style accommodation of almost any price range will usually expect you to use an in-house facility in the style of a bath house or onsen.  Bathhouses aren't expensive... but they aren't cheap either. So most people do spend time relaxing rather than just wash off and leave.  I'd suggest having a bathhouse (or preferably, onsen/hotspring) experience- but make it an experience, not your daily routine. If you can spring for a night at a ryokan in a hot spring town, then, IMHO, that's pretty much the only accommodation at least arguably spending a lot on unless you're overflowing with money.. Or even if you have a shower, go try out an onsen someplace. But again, go do it to relax for an hour+ after a long day... not as your daily routine.",7년 전,0,

In particular, you are paying for the high speed shinkansen, which you can use as much as you want, minus a couple exceptions. JR also covers some of the trains in several of the major cities. However, the network within cities is a lot weaker. Additionally, the rate you'd pay within a city is much lower than the day by day cost of the JR pass. In practice, this means if you want to buy a JR pass, it should start as close to the time of your first shinkansen as possible, and end as close to the time you exit your last shinkansen as possible. This means that you will generally pay as you go (using an IC card) in your first or last city, or both. It also means you will probably need to pay some costs to subway companies in each city, even when your JR pass is active.",7년 전,0,

@redfish337,"A week? You don't need much. Courtesy words. It's not like most people speak much English... but I wouldn't think you'd go too far off the tourist track within a week, which should at least have SOMEONE there who can help you in English if needed.  So in that case, you could mostly do fine with just gestures... and if necessary, you would likely be able to find someone who can speak it.  That said, you are a year off from going... maybe even almost two years off. Again, not sure if you're really getting much return on investment for time spent learning if you'll only be there a week... but you have time to invest. Even just one word a week puts you at a strong advantage going over there. Recommended words: Numbers 1 to 10 at least, 100, 1000, 10000 helpful for money. Direction words. Simple locations- bathroom, station, park Courtesy words: sumimasen, arigatou, douzo, etc.  The more you know... the more you can take advantage of... the better you can enjoy things a bit more off the beaten path, and maybe even meet some people who don't speak English well. A lot of things would be quite hard without at least being able to read some, and not being able to speak Japanese will almost always cost you some time and money in country (failure to take advantage of discounts, time lost being lost, etc). Knowing more will improve your time. But... you can do fine without it, and it's probably not an efficient use of time to learn much just for the 1 week of travel.",7년 전,0,
@redfish337,"Going just to Tokyo, and only for a week... it's going to significantly depend on where you're coming from... and to a lesser degree on your interests and how budget friendly you plan to make it.  But a week... you could easily do for 700 USD + plane ticket... but I'd still at least have access to 1000 USD. I doubt you'd actually even get close to 700 on just day to day stuff... but that gives a lot of leeway should you want to haul a bunch of stuff home.  Over two weeks your leeway need decreases and some things with higher up front costs starts to give a better per day average... and it'd probably be more like 1200 USD (access to 1600) + plane ticket. But once you start going that long people generally want to go visit other cities... which increases costs significantly. I personally have no issue keeping entertained for 3+ weeks in just Tokyo though.  Anyway, this is just a general estimate knowing nothing about you... you can go cheaper if your tastes are inexpensive- nature, shrines etc, or significantly more, as the sky is really the limit on prices in Tokyo. This presumes a hostel or something like that....if you go with at least one other person, the per person costs should decrease and/or you can get much better lodging for the price.",7년 전,0,
@redfish337,"Generally... you just count it as cents.  So if something is 500 yen... it's 500 cents... or 5 dollars. So that's the benchmark people use as a quick estimate... it's super easy. However, it does fluctuate between about 80 and 120 yen to the dollar though. Right now, the dollar is strong versus the yen, so it's been around 110 yen to the dollar. So you basically just run the same calculation, and then give yourself a 10% discount for having the right currency at the right time.  So a 1000 yen thing is 1000 cents... or 10 dollars... but you get a 10% discount now so you count it as 9 dollars.",7년 전,0,

While you don't have to talk to anyone... they're much more social.

@ryanohlson4181,"Housing that meets the standards of most middle-class westerners is expensive, but the vast majority of Japanese people, especially the younger generation and those who are still single or don't have kids, live in much, much smaller homes/apartments, and it's very common for salaried jobs to also have the benefit of partially subsidized housing, ie your employer pays for part of your housing, or has some sort of arrangement with a management company to give slightly cheaper rent. Crime rates are very low, so lower income areas are nowhere near as scary, most are totally fine, and there are a lot of factors that are actually super affordable compared to places like America. Owning a car is very expensive, for example, but you don't really need to in most cases, because public transit is both efficient and reasonably affordable. Reasonably healthy food is also very affordable as well. If you're cooking for yourself, it's probably about the same, but there's much more available that's convenient and relatively healthy compared to any sort of convenience foods you find in western countries.   Another big one is health care. While some things, like over the counter medicine, are more expensive, most parts of their healthcare system are vastly more affordable, and the Japanese spend far less yearly out of pocket for medical expenses than America does. This is a pretty well established problem in America, so they're a relatively exaggerated comparison, but one that's probably the most relevant for most of the people thinking about this sort of thing. The Japanese also go to the doctor much more frequently on average, which combined with the relatively affordable healthy food, makes it a very healthy country overall, which helps with the reduced medical costs in general.   I've seen a couple videos that break all this down, and it seems to work out that, for the average single person, the cost to maintain a reasonable, middle class standard of living for Japan is actually much lower than many people think it is, even living in the middle of Tokyo, and often works out to a fair bit less than most places in America. The lifestyle is just different. If you feel like you need to have a big suburban home with a sizable lawn, 1-3 cars, and two dogs, then yea, Japan is gonna be pretty expensive.",7년 전,24,

@redfish337,"I think the main problem besides cost is... ticket sales are already going on sale.  Like, literally after the new year.  I'm not sure things are popular enough to sell out, but you're losing priority the longer you wait to buy... and you just don't have the mobility to be able to buy with something fuzzy like 70-140 people.  I don't know what will be left by the time you could get something organized.  Also, even the pool is over a 3 week or so period over a relatively large swath of Japan even just to see only the Ireland matches.  Since you can't just stay in one area or so, cost will be a bit higher. And 3 weeks + travel time would be like a month long trip... so, it'd probably not hit all the pool matches.  More than likely, you'd want to get in touch with a travel agent... maybe the official one they're using... as they'd be able to secure tickets without having to go through the Japanese lottery systems.  I doubt you'd be able to pull it off for under 1500 euro per person for a 10 days in country (~12ish total) without some sort of government subsidy or deal. Which, if you really are a rugby school, may be possible... you'd have to ask... may get you better seats too or some bonus stuff. Also, that's a low-ball that depends on getting a decent plane price. If asking people to put down 1500 Euro already seems ridiculous, well, then it's probably not going to happen and you should start planning just for yourself. If 1500 Euro seems possible, remember that you'd have to work hard to get it that low and it will probably be higher.",7년 전,0,

@lkiing,"I have visited Japan twice now, once last summer 2016 and just now Dec. 2017.  Yes, there are definitely things that are expensive especially in Tokyo but boy, you also have lots of cheap options.  This video is really good but I just want to clarify some things and/or add info.  The Tokyo subway is vast and is operated by multiple different lines (private and government).  One is a private company which is Japan Rail who also operate the Shinkansen.  You can only get the Japan Rail pass outside of Japan as a tourist and is definitely worth it.  Like the video says, it only takes one long ride on the Shinkansen to make the 1 week pass worth it and on top of that you can ride the Japan Rail trains in the city for free.  BUT, here is the clarification, JR is not the metro/subway, it is only a portion of it.  There is a massive network of trains.  If you ONLY got the JR pass, you cannot ride the rest of the subway system in Tokyo.  You can only ride on the trains operated by JR.  Now the video is wrong in that it says you have to stand around buying tickets if you don't get the JR pass.  That's also not true.  What you should do is to buy a PASMO or SUICA card.  These are literally train debit cards and they work across all these different train companies.  They come preloaded with amounts and you can just tap your way through all the trains and it will deduct an amount each time.  No need to go buy a ticket each time and figure out how much it costs.  When the balance runs low (and you'll see your balance every time you tap),  you can just re-charge them in the ticket machines.  I got mine from Haneda airport and when I left I just returned it at the airport and I got a 500 Yen deposit refund for the card.  Concerning the food, I would definitely pick Yoshinoya over the other ones.  I find its quality just a bit better and the prices just as good.  But I had a lunch at Nakajima in Shinjuku and it is a 1 Michelin Star restaurant.  Guess how much the lunch is:  800 Yen!  So how's that for a budget lunch at a 1 Michelin star restaurant.  It opens at 11:30am so lineup early.  I waited just short of an hour but if you get there like 11:30am your wait should be shorter.  There is also a 1 Michelin star ramen place in Tokyo (near Sengoku) and cheapest ramen is 1000 Yen, its name is Tsuta.  And there are many other top notch ramen shops whose prices are cheaper too.  I also find 7 Eleven, Lawson, Family Mart to be full of good stuff to buy but you can try their local grocery stores and they have even MORE items with the same prices.  And the food shops in the train stations are amazing and tons of selection with excellent prices.  I also agree with the video's recommendation of business hotel.  I got one last year and it slept 3 of us plenty well with a kitchen/dining table too and it was just a bit higher than the capsule hotel prices.  Happy travels in Japan!",7년 전,130,

You have more freedom to stay more than one night with this pass.  With the nation-wide JR pass, in order to maximize the value, you need to travel very frequently to maximize the value.

I live in Arizona and the price of a ticket from Phoenix is about $1000 dollars during the summer (which happens to be the most popular time to go) so I would drive to LAX to get a cheap ticket for roughly $560. A single bed hostel for $40-$60 a night over two weeks. We usually party a lot and go to clubs or bars there which had us sp ending about $600 a week. I would suggest if you're looking to travel all over Japan transportastion will cost you minimum $100 a week if you use the subway system. All in all I would recommend you save about $2500 minimum ($3000 to be safe) to be safe if you want to stay for two weeks. If you want to have a really good time I would suggest getting bottle service at a club. If you go with a few people the total bill will run about $800 with tip and gratuity. The most I've personally spent during a two week period in Japan was about $5500 and I went to a bar/club every other day. Figure out what you want to do when you're there and what the end goal is. If you wanna get super drunk and have some fun, be prepared to spend a lot of cash. If you want to travel around the area and sight see, no more than $3000 should be required.

@redfish337,"Doing what?  A budget conscious tourist (ie, free spending but not wasteful) would probably want about 3000 USD for a month.  If you just want to exist there... well... maybe 100 USD?  You'd either have to successfully couchsurf or do a work for lodging program. And eat on the cheap and not go much of anywhere except by hitchhiking or walking. But I mean, yeah, it's doable. I suppose you could beg or make friends to get by on literally nothing, but 100 USD is a safer (though of course, ridiculous) minimum. Oh and the high end is maybe... 40000 USD per month?  So yeah, somewhere between 100 and 40000 USD.  =P  But yeah, something more like 2000-4000 USD is probably the realistic range.",7년 전(수정됨),1,

You'll want to check the prices. Sometimes these go on sale... but you're probably stuck taking some sort of out of the way route to keep the price down. You'll have to make a judgement call on how much of a detour is worth the price savings. And again, non-stop deals can happen... check the flight prices often and making sign up for price alert e-mails.  Haneda airport is in Tokyo, and about a 30-60 minute train ride to where you'd probably actually be staying.

@redfish337,"Well, I don't think he's an expert at that. Nor am I.  And it depends a LOT on the ages of those kids.  I'd generally suggest airbnb so you can get something a little bigger than a hotel, for less than a hotel  Understand that there are some children's fares for the trains, and some very young are free with adult tickets.  And strollers/prams out in the major tourist areas... are rare.  And traditional places aren't necessarily going to have access at all. It's a safe country, but there's a lot of walking involved so it's not that convenient with really young kids.  If they're a bit older so that they can more or less walk around on their own, and at least have an interest in Pokemon or something if nothing else, then you can start planning a bit differently.  Nevertheless, you should be able to budget for around 150-220 USD per day depending on exact family size, ages, and interests + flight cost + long-distance travel... plus any big one time expenses such as Disney.",7년 전,0,

The companies were split again in 1949. So, 20-30 years separate, 40 years together, and now 60-70ish years for their taste to have diverged.",7년 전,1,

@redfish337,"I recommend pre-booking everything.  But with airbnb and such available now it's not as vital. The main reason I recommend it is simply because it's something you can get done from home.  Anything you can research and get done from home saves you time in country. And unlike say, a backpack tour of Europe where you can see drastic changes country to country and one place may be a lot less your style than you had thought,  the differences from one place to another in Japan will be more subtle.  You should be able to have a good idea of how long you want to stay in each place before arriving. Also, while I have been able to find last minute accommodation in Japan- booking like 8 days in a row... that sort of thing... that does in fact  often dry up and you get stuck wasting time moving your crap around/checking in to extra places you can only stay 1-4 days or whatever.  Also, pretty much as soon as you move out of Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, your hostels choices go way down and you have to rely on airbnb if you wait too long- which is usually fine of course. For example, I looked up Fukuoka- a huge city with not enough hostels. Right now, there are 3 available for late October- one has no rating because it hasn't been in business recently... one is really far out from the city center, and one is actually passable but only has a few male dorm beds left. So, basically, ALREADY nothing, so you'd have to airbnb there.  The other major reason I recommend pre-booking is that your transportation costs depend a lot on where you will be going. You can't really make an intelligent transportation purchase without at least a skeleton itinerary.  And I say this as someone who likes a lot of flexibility. I plan the skeleton well, but leave the day to day stuff fairly open.  Of course, Japan is pretty easy and most things are safe. So if flexibility is your thing, then go for it.

I'm basically planning to do a big loop from Tokyo, down towards Hiroshima and then onto Kyushu and Shikoku and back up on to Honshu! I booked hostels for Tokyo and Kyoto as I know they tend to be busier but the rest I'll try and book a couple of days before I arrive! I'm not really planning on being anywhere for longer than a couple of days anyways! I'm just trying to let go a bit and see what happens! I can't wait 😊",7년 전,0,

@suzinabox,"LoveAnimeLikeCrazy Hey - I had no problems getting accommodation, and neither did any of the other travellers I met! Most of the hostels I stayed in were fairly new and had opened in the last year or two. I think this is probably in response to the increased popularity of travel to Japan!   So I can see why in the past you would have to pre-book, but not such an issue now, especially in the less busy seasons. It may not be the case if you were travelling for the cherry blossoms or autumn leaves, I think then you would have to pre-book! Also, Japan was the most amazing place I’ve ever been to, the food, the culture, the people, I was so sad to leave! I can’t wait to go back at some point in the future :)",7년 전,5,

Tex-mex is a little lacking, but there's still some available. You could go to a family restaurant for breakfast, eat eggs, bacon and toast with a coffee... go have chicken cutlet curry rice for lunch... and then go to an izakaya and have beef and oyster and horse and tuna sashimi... and then, having been obligated to pay a lot of money for not a lot of food, eat some McDonald's on the way home.

@oldtwins,"If you're getting the rail pass, pay the extra for the business class ""green car""  - that's where the real value comes into play.   Not for the extra comfort (that too, but...) You're much more likely to get a seat ticket at any given time for any ride of the day in business, but while in regular class these can be booked up many weeks in advance and you cannot reserve a seat until you're in Japan.  You see, the pass only gives you the right to ride stand-by on the train.   The seat ticket is free with the pass, but these must be reserved first.  You will want a seat ticket to get an assigned seat, especially if you're travelling with another person so you can sit together.    Also, the business class section is much quieter since only corporate executives and celebrities are reimbursed to ride in those sections.  Else, you might end up being in a car with a bunch of high school girls that will drive you insane.  Also keep in mind the pass might be pretty worthless for many subway systems.  Tokyo metro, for example, is not valid with the pass and is a far more efficienct way of getting around Tokyo than with JR.",8년 전(수정됨),0,

@redfish337,"The only time I ever couldn't get the exact train I wanted was a sakura shinkansen  from Osaka to Fukuoka... during Golden Week. It's not really much of an issue. And... this may be BS and if so, I apologize, but one time I had a schedule change and despite the hikari I wanted showing up as ""X"", or, sold out... they gave me a ticket anyway. It specifically said ""JR pass ticket"" or something like that. So... apparently there are a few in reserve for JR pass users, at least on hikari trains, at least if you show up before the last minute to get your ticket.  The basic area is sufficiently spacious, especially compared to planes, and the upcharge is fairly significant. (10000 7 day,  16000 14 day, 22000 21 day). It's in play, but I don't know if I'll ever get it. I rather spend the 16000-22000 yen somewhere else.  That said... if you happen to take a Platt Kodama train, the upcharge is only 1500 extra yen from Tokyo to Shin-Osaka. Of course, taking Platt Kodama in the first place probably means you're on a budget, but if the point is more to enjoy the ride than get there quickly, a green car ride on a platt kodama may be a nice trip.",8년 전,0,

@TheKarthe,"I went to Tokyo for one week in February 2016. A flight in the off season from LA to Tokyo cost me about $800. I found an Air BnB in a residential neighborhood for around $55/night, and I got the Japan Rail Pass for about, I believe, $210. Before I left, I went to a local bank, and did a currency exchange for $200 into Yen (About 20,000 JPY). So, combined airfare, accommodations, and local travel came to about $1400. I paid for all of my meals using the yen I got before I left, with the exception of a 6 course Wagyu beef dinner I splurged on and paid for with my debit card (about $150).  $3200 is definitely enough to take a trip, but there are a couple things you can do to save money. If you're sticking to Tokyo, you would probably be better off not getting the rail pass, and just paying for local train trips piecemeal. I took a day trip to Kyoto via bullet train if for no other reason than to justify the money I spent on the pass. Additionally, I was relatively frugal with what I did. I avoided many restaurants, especially if they did not have an english menu, as I don't have a firm grasp on the language. my breakfasts were simple, a pastry from a nearby bakery, or fruit from a market. Lunch was usually Ramen, and dinner often inexpensive (sushi or, one night, a kebab bowl). I didn't go out drinking, stayed away from a lot of the expensive tourist offerings or guided tours, and opted mostly for exploring the city on my own, getting lost, and checking out free or low-price attractions.

Oh, free open fountain drinks as well. I mainly did it when I got tired of going back to the base or wanted to travel around on a budget.  During my time there, I met quite a few men who lived in this way. They didn't earn enough to really have an apartment and worked too much to really justify the expense anyways.

@homicide58halo,"Great video! Yeah, a lot of people make out Japan to be a super expensive place but, it is actually quite affordable. Since Korea is really close to Japan I've visited on multiple occasions for shopping and touring. From those experiences I guarantee you can save A LOT of money if you plan properly.  A lot of the parts people make mistakes in when planning is transportation. You can literally spend days worth of hotel fees on transportation if your not smart about it. So here are some rules to keep in mind if your traveling on a budget.  RULE #1 Never use a taxi! You might feel a little lazy or bewildered on how to get to your destination. But, in most major cities of Japan public and private transportation is very well developed. And taxis are EXPENSIVE. A twenty minute drive will land you over 2000 yen.  If you happen to lose your way to a destination just ask for directions. :) Japanese are very kind in that aspect. Even if you can't speak a word of Japanese, showing them a destination in google map is often enough and they will help you out as much as possible. Seriously in several occassions strangers walked me all the way to the destination!  RULE #2 Always check where you are visiting.  I advise people who visit Japan to check where they want to visit before hand(or at least the major stops) and check if their subway pass or any sort of travel pass they've got covers the locations. I've seen a lot of people having to get new tickets or passes because the train lines they wished to take were not covered by there travel pass.   For instance Osaka has like three different subway/train lines all with seperate payment because they fall under different companies. So the pass you have might only cover one of those lines and not the others.  RULE #3 Check your travel objective. This might be a little overlaping with Rule #2 but, hear me out. Depending on your travel objective the type of travel pass or transportation ticket you'd want to get will vary.  Drastically.   If you look up the different travel passes, you can easily find that there are passes designed for shoppers, sight seekers, long term or short term travel. They also come with different perks for specific people, like discounts to museum or castle entrance fees and so on.  RULE #4 Step away from that hotel. Not being able to stay at a hotel might seem like a bummer. But if your going to half ass and stay at an average hotel it is much better to go for guest houses or Air Bnb deals. Especailly if your traveling with friends of 3~4 Air bnb can be a god send. Some guest houses will also have interesting tourist guides to the local area. The kind of experiences you'd normally not know if you went to a fancy hotel.  Woah this has gotten out of control...  Well you can sense my excitement with traveling to Japan.   I've said rules and what not, but remember its just a trip.  You don't have to follow your plans by the book.  Just have a blast and enjoy your stay in Japan like I've did. :)",8년 전(수정됨),195,

@redfish337,"To be frank, it depends a lot on how many people are going and what they wanted to do. His guide provided a lot of options, but the best course depends on your exact situation.  That said, as a general estimate, I suggest: 100 USD/day + flight + long-distance transportation + 200 USD buffer Of the 100 USD/day, about 50-60/day will be on ""required"" stuff- lodging, (basic)food, (basic) transportation.  And 40-50 USD/day is for fun- entry fees, event tickets, buying stuff, fancier food or drink, day trip transportation, etc.  For a 4 day trip, your long-distance transportation is probably 0. For a 7 day trip, you'd want to decide if it's worth going to another region or just sticking to Tokyo OR Osaka/Kyoto.  You probably won't need to use much if any of the buffer- that's why it's a buffer. However, on a short trip you're at risk of not ""averaging out""... on a two week trip there will almost certainly be some cheap days that help balance out your splurge days. If you just go four days they may all be splurge days and so the recommendation may be low. So make sure you have some extra available as buffer.   For a 7 day, 6 night  trip, I would just go to Tokyo. If you never plan to go to Japan ever again then it'd be hard to not recommend going to Tokyo + Kyoto, but for me going, I'd just do one or the other.  Lodging would be about 27*6  Basic food 20*7 (one solid inexpensive meal (800-1200), one fast food meal (400-700), snack (100-300) + vending machine x2-3 (200-300))  Wifi: 40- wifi cost is front-loaded with rentals- this is a high estimate for this length of stay  Transportation: 20 (to/from airport) + 30 (two 72 hour passes) + 10 (assorted random costs)  My recommended was 100 USD/day + 200 USD buffer... which means 900 USD + flight for this trip. My lodging + basic food + wifi + transportation = 402 USD. That leaves about 300 USD- or about 30 USD/day for fun with 90 USD to buy some stuff, before breaking into your buffer.",8년 전(수정됨),0,
@redfish337,"While a taxi is hardly ever a good option, it's not never a good option, particularly if there are at least 3 and ideally 4 of you. They're ridiculously expensive, but if your route is relatively short but requires a train company transfer (metro to JR, for example), the taxi can come out ahead with a party of 4 and close enough to be worth saving the trouble with 3.

@Langepon,"Ryoko007 the best way to get a cheap flight is to book more than 6 months in advance. I also made the experience during my Japan trips that's it's better to book a flight from a travel agency since their prices are never worse than those you can find online. Last time Everyone even got a free 2 big luggage place for free. But the main reason was that we weren't able to checkin for our flight because of strange technical issues and I called our agent and she helped us out immediately. From the other side of the world! Otherwise we would have had to spend a ridiculous amount of money to get a taxi to narita airport because it was already very late, buses were all gone, trains stopped and out flight was very early. You can book hotels and other things over the Internet but for your flight, which is the most crucial part - get an agent.",8년 전,0,

@fallenpheonixrising,"These are great tips. I've done all of them and while some (*cough* night bus *cough*) are far from comfortable they all serve their purpose and help keep things cheap letting you explore more of Japan. Just a word of caution though. If you speak little to no Japanese most of these options will be a bit more difficult as most of the time the fluent English speaking customer service is found in medium to high-end touristy places. A lot of people in Japan speak a little English at least though and they are the most accommodating people in the world so the majority will be more than happy to play some charades and wait for you to type out every sentence on a translator. A trip like this with limited Japanese is totally doable just don't go into any of these places expecting people to speak English even in Tokyo.(Also pro tip if you don't have a translator handy try writing what you want in simple English. Japanese people study reading and writing far more than speaking so it could save your bacon in a pinch but I would still come prepared.)    Another thing to keep in mind is luggage. You will have at most a very thin locker for storage so I wouldn't bring a big suitcase. I always had my pack in with me when I was in a capsule hotel or a hostel and had a smaller bag with my money, passport, camera etc. that I would lock up with a padlock I carried with me. Japan is VERY safe but you still need to take precautions, especially where you'll mostly be encountering other travellers. Sidenote for the ladies. Finding a capsule hotel will be a lot harder for you. They were originally designed for businessmen and they are divided by sex so there are far more for men than there are for women. There are a few in Tokyo that are divided by floor but they are few and far between so book early if you want to go that route (and you should I really recommend it!). Also, both men and women should prepare themselves for the bath options at capsule hotels and some hostels. It's usually done onsen style so if you aren't comfortable being naked in front of a room full of strangers you may want to go for the business or love hotel. Furthermore, if you have any tattoos you will need to make sure you're allowed to stay there as well since some places that use onsen style bathing have the same restrictions as most other onsens and gyms and won't let you in with tatts.   Also, a couple tips for the night bus, while the website is in English the customer service and drivers probably will NOT be English speaking. My friends and I were supposed to catch a night bus in Shinjuku once and there were about 50+ night buses lined up 20 minutes before we were scheduled to leave, none of them ours so I spent a pretty frantic time talking to the woman on the service line in my broken Japanese that was still the best in the group. We finally found it but it probably took about a year off my life in extra stress. If you do decide to do the night-bus you will be in desperate need of a shower and if you're not planning to check in to a hotel for awhile there's kind of a weird trick. Most internet cafes have showers you can rent for set periods of time. I haven't tried this method myself as I was always checking in somewhere when I got to my destination so I can't testify personally but look into it if you're desperate. Also on the night bus, I would definitely recommend springing for the slightly more expensive seat. It makes a world of difference, you have much more leg room and you're not surrounded so closely on both sides. For me, it meant waking up after a restful night's sleep for the first time in about a dozen night bus trips and I never went back!   Most of all though enjoy Japan. It's truly an amazing experience! I'd recommend you use all the money you save to treat yourself to some sort of fun experience that is uniquely Japanese and get the most out of your trip rather than spend the whole time counting yen and stressing the conversion. Be flexible, be patient, and be open to new experiences. Don't panic if things don't go exactly according to plan and take the chance to explore if you miss your stop or get lost somewhere. Trust me on this. ;)",8년 전,0,

@redfish337,"July and August have a lot more festivals and events, particularly at night. The weather is brutally hot and humid. September's weather starts improving, but doesn't really reach a turning point until the 20th-25th or so. Despite still being quite hot, there are fewer activities in September so it's a lot of extra suffering for nothing. =P October is probably the 3rd best month in terms of weather. If you're there towards the end you may even be able to catch some of the change to autumn leaves, though it may take a day trip out to altitude. This whole period is technically typhoon season, though typhoons to Tokyo area don't tend to be much more than a bad 1 day rainstorm (Fukuoka and western areas get hit worse and more often). They can still happen in October, but they start to be less common. I strongly recommend late September or October if you have a choice. Summer is love/hate... if you end up loving Japan and decide you want to go to Obon in Kyoto, or Tokushima Awaodori, or Aomori Nebuta or some of the mostly July fireworks festivals... or climb Mt. Fuji if you're crazy, or some other stuff... there's stuff that is great that you can only do in summer that you may decide is worth the weather. And other stuff that is just culturally summer. But, the weather sucks. Really sucks. Save it for when you're a bit more of a pro so you don't have to deal with culture shock/confusion + heat/humidity at the same time, or your schedule obligates you to go then. There's still plenty to see in October! And for all the stuff you can see any time of year, that's a far more enjoyable time! ALSO, although variable, flights tend to be more expensive in summer than you can get most other times of year.",8년 전(수정됨),0,

The National Museum (and others)  is closed from the 26th, for example! They take an early vacation so that they can be open for the days after New Year but before most people go back to work.

@redfish337,"Japan was the first non-Western power to basically become a ""Western power"".  They were the first to get the Olympics for example. Japan has been a place with the modernity comfortable to those from the West, with the allure of being Eastern.  As an aside, China is and has been Communist. Especially during the Cold War, that put them at an extreme disadvantage in terms of exporting their culture. South Korea has been on friendly terms with the West for a long time, but they were dealing with the Korean War and aftermath as Japan was finishing rebuilding and turning into an economic powerhouse.    So you can look at modern pop culture and say that say, K-pop or Chinese movies, are beating Japan internationally- but Japan has had say, the modern concept of the ninja, or samurai or Godzilla ingrained in the Western imagination for decades. And in modern times it's not just anime- Nintendo revived the video game industry, and that means all their big name franchises are some of the biggest names in video games.

I just typically need a high end one  Those are your ""needs"" and I will round up to $29, 7, 20 and 4, for convenience, which is $60/day... or about $1800 for the month.  That leaves a good  $700-1200 to play and buy crap. Which should be more than sufficient for the average tourist. Want to buy a LOT of crap? Then you'll need more money.

We'll be staying at Airbnbs and one hotel that offers studio apartments. I'd like to go by bullet train from Tokyo to Kyoto, but I won't get a JR card, as the JR website calculator reckons it's not worth buying one. IT looks like exactly the same bullet train we used in China, but in China it was a lot cheaper. The Peach Airlines website doesn't work here in Europe (I'm British but live in Germany). Any tips on how to get around this? Also, all the wonderful Ryokans with onsens that I've checked out are hugely expensive!

Do you know if Japanese people are not afraid of taking hitchhikers with them and I am sure I will have to pay from time to time for some kind of bus or ferry, so do you know the prices for ferries from Hokkaido or the ones going to Kagawa or Tokushima costs?

Also, for subway trips within Tokyo, there is a special 2-day pass only available to foreigners that you can only buy in the Bic Camera shop in Shinjuku. It was something like 900¥ for 2 days of unlimited Tokyo Metropolitan subway rides.   Nobody ever talks about this, yet they are the cheapest options.",8년 전,0,
@sanchaofgo,I think the best way to find the cheapest hotel is to look up TripAdvisor and compare prices between different travel agencies. Sometimes some agencies like Rakuten and JTB travel have big sales. You also want to make sure its cancellation policy is realistic before you purchase. JAPANiCAN.com often have a terrible cancellation policy. You didn't mention but Agoda often has some insider deals you can't find elsewhere. I often find cheaper hotels in Kamata and Shin Yokohama area when I want to stay around Tokyo. I suggest foreign travelers to make the best use out of JR pass and go to as many distant cities as possible. Japanese citizen cannot purchase them. It's a privilege for travelers from abroad only. It's fun to explore local cities. You can get reserved seats with no additional cost and don't need to feel uncomfortable during the trip. JR trains are quite comfortable.,8년 전(수정됨),0,

Her companiones were just as loud and sounded like cats were trapped in their throats.  My ear plugs were useless.    Nowadays I stick to capsule hotels or single room hostels.    The other horror of hostels are the infamous plastic-bag packers.  They wake up at the crack of dawn to repack their bags for over two hours -- a constant crinkle, crinkle.

@jaggubu,"As a solo traveller, I survived on about 7000 yen per day. This included accomodation, food, tickets and transport (within cities).  However, I did have a JR pass. Basically I went through from Kagoshima (southern tip) to Kyoto (around the central area).  Taking about 1-3 days in interesting prefectures.   way to be real budget: Go to supermarkets for breakfast and lunch. Basically I bought a loaf of bread on sale (500 yen) and i ate one or two pieces each morning for breakfast. For lunch, I'd take something I could eat while walking. I'd thus save time (i could look around and eat) and money (takeaway foods tend to be cheaper). dinner would depend on my spending for the day. Sometimes, I'd have leftovers for souveniors too  staying at guest houses ranged from 1600yen - 3000yen per night.  tickets averaged 600-1200yen.",8년 전,0,

@jaggubu,"very worth it. because i changed cities every 1-2 days. There was once i started off at Kitakyushu (north part of kyushu), stopped by 2 big stations in Saga and ended my evening off at Hiroshima. All those were covered by the pass.   If I didn't get the rail pass my rail cost would have been in the thousands I believe. The ease and ability to get reserved seats was also a great plus.   If you want to know if its worthit for you, you can get costs for train trips on hyperdia. com and then calculate if its more or less than the rail pass cost",8년 전,0,

@MrsXxyaoixx,"We stayed for a week in Japan was not bad. We are a family of 4. We stayed at a airbnb apartment that cost around $600 dollars for a week.  That is Monday to following Monday.  Food; for breakfast we bought cereal, eggs, milk, etc, For the week. We did spend money on restaurants for lunch or dinner. Depending on our day.  I found restaurants at malls are more expensive than the ones you find on streets. Cokes/sodas are around 3 to 5 dollars in restaurants. Yeah we spend almost 20 dollars once on drinks, after that we decided to get them at the bending machines. They are everywhere and way cheaper. You can also get good food at the supermarkets. They have sushi, salads, veggies, and many more things. I recomend the noodles. We ate there every other day. Come after 6 or 7pm. That's when the food gets a discount, half or more in their price.   Train/metro;  if you will be using the train I recommend buying the passes. I think is more conviniant, and you won't end up with a wallet full of coins.  So only main stations have English maps. Take a pic. Of that map, you will need it. I know there is an app you can use as Well but I don't remember the name.   So this is how it works; Always remember your station name, number and line. Also lines or train have specific colors.  Ex; nin shinjukI station, #29, oedo line. Oedo line is pink. You will see the 29 number in a pink circle.   I hope this made sence.   Money/ credit cards;  With had no problem with our credit card. We let our bank know we were traveling so that we could use our cards. If your bank doesn't have this service I do not know what you can do.  All restaurants and shops accepted our cards. But we did exchange dollars  to yen before comming to Japan.  I do recommend exchanging your dollars. Depending on dollar worth you might get a little more yen!.   For those of you comming from south Korea remember that 800 yen is not almost a won or a dollar. It is almost 10 won/ dollars. I learned this the hard way. 😑   Remember to save money for your way back to airport. Put it aside, so you have it ready for your last day.   Overall I thought Japan was expensive. But if you are comming from USA. It will feel like no change. Everything is pricey, specially for a family. We been in south Korea for a bit and you can do so much more here. The dollar goes a long way. Once you go to Japan come to South Korea, you will love it.",8년 전,0,

It's done a certain way. If you're intent on doing this, check up on it specifically!  Taxis, you aren't really supposed to tip, but I've heard some have apparently taken it upon themselves to basically take money if you give an amount of money that would be equal to about fare + tip. Taxis are already ridiculously expensive- don't encourage the practice. You don't tip money like this anywhere else in Japan and almost everyone says not to tip taxis.  If you go to a Western place, there may be a service charge that may or may not be included, but I  think I've only seen it once or twice.

Fortunately the currents there push most of that out to be diluted down to nothingness in the vast Pacific. But, parts of that area may still be somewhat dangerous. You can't go to the potentially dangerous areas anyway.  Hiroshima and Nagasaki were hit by air blasts meant to maximize blast damage, not radiation. Aside for those immediately affected by high energy particles, there were few long-term aftereffects and the cities are at this point at or below the global radiation average.",8년 전,1,

Even with only a carry-on it's pretty much constant activity on your part without much break. Shinkansen, you pretty much go to the city center station... get on a train, take a break or nap in a nice big seat, and get off at the city center of your destination.

Book plane in advance,  three months before.  you'll get them for 600dollar or so for a young adult  3) get a pasmo card, use at trains and cafes. Saves u some yen. Or travel by buss. There u go  Budge could be around 2000dollars for a girl, and meaby less for a guy.   No problem.  😉 Was there for two weeks, visited Osaka, Nagano, Tokyo, asakusa and so on.

@Rin-ef2tp,"My biggest tip is if you want to go to a nice restaurant then go at lunch time. They normally do a lunch special which is pretty cheap compared to their dinner prices and super tasty. Then for dinner time you can go somewhere cheap like sukiya or just get a 711 bentou. I managed to travel for 3 months from Okinawa to Sapporo spending ¥400,000 or $4000 for the whole time including food Accomodation travel and tourist attractions (starting and ending in Yamaguchi so this includes flights from/to there) The south (Kyushu and Okinawa) is much cheaper than the North because they have cheaper and more choice of hostels and a fantastic bus system so I spent half of the time there and the other half traveling the main island and Hokkaido in the North I bought multiple Seishun 18 Kinpu (a ticket for local trains which you can use  in the main tourist/holiday seasons) and traveled that way which is good to do if you have a little more time to travel as it can take sometimes 3 times longer to get somewhere rather than using the Shinkansen but it's great to use if you want to go to multiple places on the same day along a specific route (make sure to avoid the rush hour if you're traveling with a backpack or everyone will hate you)",8년 전,1,

It isn't very common to use or accept credit cards for low priced stuff. Let's say that if your bill is less than 1500 yens, then it is very probable that they won't accept credit card payment.  A cheap meal is bento (box lunch). There are special stores like Origin Bento, or you can find them in some cheap diners too. A bento in a convenience store is cheap, but in a Supermarket it is even cheaper, so if you can, go to a supermarket. And most supermarkets accept credit cards.  And, you also have a manga kissaten as an alternative for a place to stay for one night. A manga kissaten is a place where you can read all the manga (in japanese) you want, watch TV, use a computer, internet, etc for a fixed fee that can be per hour or per night.

@furikakez,"The charge that the stores have to pay for every credit card transaction is quite expensive and the money deposit has a few days delay so that's why small business don't want to accept cards for small transactions, they will be losing money. I don't know how stores abroad deal with this but that's why some stores here will give you less discount or points if you use a credit card or just simply don't accept.  And it is true that some business like real state or foodstuffs still use fax. Usually managed by old people who haven't adapted to modern methods or can't use or don't want to invest in a computerized solution. You have young people always trying to use the most advanced solution and old people using what they think is safest and require less changes or learning. And I think that's true for every country, not only Japan.

Travelled Tokyo (day trips to Kamakura and Toshigi shrine) -> Osaka (Kyoto was booked so did day trips there and also to Nara) -> Hiroshima (Day trip to Miyajima).  Travelled alone, stayed in hostels - sort of lonely but very memorable. Ate lots of Japanese cuisines, sometimes at Yoshinoya too. I had a Japan rail pass and I can say if you aren't much into saving money, Shinkansen is very convenient and comfortable. Once I travelled 4 hours back from Osaka to Tokyo to get my Camera SD card repaired (but couldn't get it repaired and lost half of my photos). But the most memorable journey was waking up at 4:30 AM near Miyajima and then catching the 6 AM Shinkansen for a 6 HOUR continuous trip NON-STOP from Hiroshima-shin to Tokyo Station!! Ate Eki-bentos like a King and took pictures of Mount Fuji. I stayed at Narita for a day, in the evening I learned that the very next when I had to catch my flight back home, they had Taiko Drum festival!!

Only the sleezy illegal ones double as brothals, so you have to bring your own playmate.

Yes, they spent about 20 minutes trying to explain the bathroom break schedule (or as Britts say, ""sh-eh-jew-l"") before they finally mustered up the phrase ""toilet time"". Granted, that was the highlight of the ride, I arrived to my hostel with my jet lag reincarnated. Yes, if you're on a very tight budget, this is an option (especially if you're a deep sleeper) but you should also consider the fact that you have a limited time in Japan.

I wanted to do know what your advice would be for getting around this issue in the easiest way if I ever do go to Japan since I cannot consume wheat based noodles.

Also, the longer you book, the price should be better.  2. Conbini stores are awesome. $2-3 for a breakfast.  3.

Something I never see people talking about are the beaches in Japan, I feel like it would be SUPER fun to buy a couple drinks from a convenience store and just hang out on the beach at night with a few friends. Man, there is so much stuff I'd want to do. I feel like a few weeks wouldn't be nearly enough to experience everything. I'd want to stay for at least a month.   I wonder if a few thousand dollars would last me a month? If I stayed in capsule hotels or hostels every night that would cost me around $1000~, and assuming that I spend maybe $20-30 on food and drink every day, that would also be around $1000~. That means if I brought $3000~ with me I'd have another $1000 extra for transportation, and whatever else I want to buy. So maybe $4000+ would be a safe bet. That sounds easy enough, a couple months of saving and I have enough money for a trip to Japan.   Better start saving!

The Host was great and VERY helpful for someone that's never been to Japan. The night we got there, she walked me down to the train station to buy a Pasmo card. We had our own room to store all our extra luggage; something you won't get with a capsule hotel.  I think we paid somewhere around $70 USD a night for a 2 person room, but if you only have one person, the room would have been 40-50 USD a night.",8년 전,0,

@MetroidMother,"A Manga-cafe is a great place to sleep if you don't have a reservation. Usually under 20$ for 8-12h including hot drinks and a PC. Also over TripAdvisor I found enough hostels starting at 10$ a night, and enough capsule hotels starting at 15$ all over Japan. One capsule hotel in Tokyo I can recommend is Capsule Value Kanda. I payed 12€ a night, and it is 1 stop from Akihabara and Tokyo station. Also very nice and clean, with a traditional Japanese bath. Thought the capsules are a bit older. In Kyoto I stayed in a private double room with a friend for 10€ a person (20€ in total) per night. The place was called small world guest house. It was a bit far from the city centre and the room was tiny, but it was still good, and the building was a very old traditional Japanese House.",8년 전,643,

But there is no way you can get a $500 apartment fully furnished in Tokyo. Not unless you are in a very small station in the far west side of Tokyo that is like at least 2  or 3 hours by train from any of the core 23 wards of Tokyo.  Usually the cheapest apartment without a single piece of furniture, inside the 23-ku should be around $550 if it is pretty far from the station (15 or more minutes by walk), or in a very far and cheap ward / district. And that's very cheap. And usually you have to pay a gratitude fee (usually 1 month rent), and you can't easily rent if you are a foreigner without a guarantor.  Fully furnished apartments in any of the main Tokyo areas should be at least $900. And very small ones.",8년 전,2,

@morganrees6163,"I've visited twice on my own in January 2016 and 2017 for Tokyo Auto Salon. To give you a basic run down. I payed £420 return flight from my local airport Cardiff to Tokyo via Amsterdam with KLM. My two weeks accommodation cost me around £600 for a 4* business hotel next to Shinjuku station (The city center), great hotel and will be returning there again next year. I must have spent around £150 on train tickets and taxi rides for two weeks, reasonably cheap considering I was traveling in the capital and made a few trips out of Tokyo. Food and drink is the same price as back home but of much better quality so I didn't really care what I was spending so can't help you there. And finally spending money was where I went all in, I easily spend £1000 on import car parts, days out, snacks and shopping. Its not as expensive as most people let on but you can easily spend all your money within the first week if you're not carefully, there is something for everyone in Japan. An quick way to save money if you plan on visiting Tokyo though is to stay in chiba prefecture, it is next to Tokyo and is a quick train ride away.",8년 전,0,

@AkariEnderwolf,"ya know... the weird thing is that I have the OPPOSITE feeling about visiting Japan.  To me, it seems cheaper than 2 weeks vacationing in America can wind up being.  Largely because most hotels in America are over $100 per night, and I've been finding plenty of options below $100 per night in Japan.  At a hotel in Detroit, a 3 night stay was enough to cost around $350 when split evenly between me and my brother, but I see hotel listings for Japan that would cost only about $50-$80 per night.  My perception may be because I've traveled all across the USA, from Maine to California, I've been to every continental state before I even graduated High School I think, if not then it was shortly after graduating that I got all 48 continental states.",8년 전(수정됨),0,

@ReVoLynx,"Helpful video! :) I am currently travelling solo through Japan on a student budget, and here are my experiences on accommodation and travel:  Accommodation: In contrast to Chris, I've found AirB&B to almost always be the cheapest option, the occasional competitor being hostels I've found with the Agoda-app, which seems to be a popular one here. Also, try couchsurfing,its 0¥!  Travel: If you have even the slightest inclination and are not on a very strict schedule, I suggest hitchhiking. Japan is by far the easiest country I've hitchhiked in, the people are so friendly and willing to help. It helps a lot if you can somewhat bridge the language barrier with Japanese skills, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.  Also keep an eye out for airline special offers, I managed to get a Peach airline ticket from Kansai to Sapporo for 3000¥. I agree with nightbuses being great for value, but much less so if you can't sleep in them, and spend your holiday all groggy because of it.",8년 전,0,

Whenever people tell me they want to travel to Japan but are afraid that they will have to spend lots and lots of money I ask them what they want to do/see, how much luxury they need and if they are willing to spend nights in hostels, eat in cheap restaurants, try new things.  I travel to Japan a lot and in my experience it totally depends on what level of comfort you need. For example, if I don't have that much money to spend I try to stay in hostels or cheaper business hotels, eat in small shops off the main roads and touristy districts, buy stuff at 100 Yen shops or those cheap drugstores. If you speak at least a bit of Japanese then it's way way easier I have to admit.  You may also spend less if you ride busses or night trains than the Shinkansen, but it will take you a lot longer to reach your destination.  On the other hand I think that most tourists want to see ""the Japan"" they envisioned, try sushi places, shop in malls like 109, buy nice souveniers and sleep in hotels that they feel comfortable in and have more or less western standards. Honestly I don't think that it's a bad thing especially if it's your first time in Japan and everybody has to know for themselves how they like to travel. I think the most important thing is that you have fun, enjoy the trip and make lots of good memories.",8년 전,0,

The 4th and 5th we stayed in Tokyo there we decided to go visit Nikko and Kamakura as one day excursions (We had the JR pass for later in the trip so this was ""free"" and a good oportunity to see more of Japan). It is easier and cheaper to reach Kamakura. Its closer and there is no need for bullet trains. I recommend here to stop at kita-kamakura station and go downhill to the beach while visiting interesting temples along the way. Then we went to Osaka to see Kyoto and more ...  Anyway, you should definetly buy the ""Tokyo Subway Ticket"" 72-hour (1500 yen). It gives you total freedom in the two subways of tokio and avoids losing time buying tickets. There are also 48 and 24 hour variants.  A tip if you don't want to spend money in the Skytree is to go up the top floors (level ~30 or so) of the near shopping mall or to visit the free Tokyo goverment building observation decks. Also, a nice restaurant we went is Uobei Sushi in Shibuya. Good price, tourist friendly and fun.",8년 전,0,

A good phrase book is the Making Out series, ""Making Out in Japanese"" and ""More Making Out in Japanese"". They teach you the way the actual Japanese people talk, using slang and shortcut terms instead of textbook Japanese (I'm pretty sure. It's been a couple of years since I looked at it, but I know my impression was favourable).

Worse comes to worse you can use google translate but I would advise against it. Other than that the closer you get to the city the more you will see people who are friendlier towards foreigners.   Another interesting thing is that with English being taught in school, children and young adults want to test their English skills on you.

@jimichan7649,"I.B.  In my experience, touring around Japan for over 20 years, I have only run into ONE less than awesomely polite experience.  That was when I entered an izakaya at midday and encountered a grandfather who was leaving.  He muttered something a little less than polite, doubtless assuming I would not understand.  To be fair, he was of the age that he probably fought in WWII, so it was understandable.   Anyway, when I addressed him using keigo (very polite Japanese), as one should when addressing elders in Japan, he was shocked and hastily excused himself.   I guess my point is, if you are polite and respectful of Japanese culture you will very rarely run into anything less than an amazing welcome anywhere in Japan.",8년 전,5,

I payed 12€ a night, and it is 1 stop from Akihabara and Tokyo station. Also very nice and clean, with a traditional Japanese bath. Thought the capsules are a bit older. In Kyoto I stayed in a private double room with a friend for 10€ a person (20€ in total) per night. The place was called small world guest house. It was a bit far from the city centre and the room was tiny, but it was still good, and the building was a very old traditional Japanese House.",8년 전(수정됨),5,

But per day in Tokyo I was spending 10-15 USD on trains, and maybe 20~ on food. Both of these costs could have dropped if I walked more (I was already doing 10+ miles a day on foot) and I was at times buying snacks/etc. If you really wanted to ball on a budget, you could do Tokyo for a week for 650 USD round trip (with layover/connection I just flew into Tokyo from Newark for 750 round trip in the middle of July via Air Canada) and allocate 75 dollars a day for food, hostel/capsule or airbnb and public transit.

We got a quiet apartment in Asakusa next to Sensoji Temple and an elementary school so every morning was punctuated by the sound of bells and pleasant school chimes. In Kyoto we splurged a little and got an entire three story house (with a full bath setup, very nice) to ourselves right next to the Kamogawa central area so everything was within walking distance.

@Rin-ef2tp,"My biggest tip is if you want to go to a nice restaurant then go at lunch time. They normally do a lunch special which is pretty cheap compared to their dinner prices and super tasty. Then for dinner time you can go somewhere cheap like sukiya or just get a 711 bentou. I managed to travel for 3 months from Okinawa to Sapporo spending ¥400,000 or $4000 for the whole time including food Accomodation travel and tourist attractions (starting and ending in Yamaguchi so this includes flights from/to there) The south (Kyushu and Okinawa) is much cheaper than the North because they have cheaper and more choice of hostels and a fantastic bus system so I spent half of the time there and the other half traveling the main island and Hokkaido in the North I bought multiple Seishun 18 Kinpu (a ticket for local trains which you can use  in the main tourist/holiday seasons) and traveled that way which is good to do if you have a little more time to travel as it can take sometimes 3 times longer to get somewhere rather than using the Shinkansen but it's great to use if you want to go to multiple places on the same day along a specific route (make sure to avoid the rush hour if you're traveling with a backpack or everyone will hate you)",8년 전,2,

We're not much for fancy food so we did as you suggested and we were eating breakfasts from the selections at Lawsons, 7/11, Fresco, FamilyMart, etc. I tended to go for ramen a lot when we ate out simply because I wanted real ramen, not what we generally get in the US.

@Rin-ef2tp,"CamWattsYourProblem the ticket is five days of travel and it has a limit on the time period of use but it's not as short as the jr pass (sometimes upwards of a month) and times when you can buy it they are normally available around new year, Sakura season and the summer holidays.",8년 전,1,
@saldiven2009,"@CammWatts: Remember that the JRPass also gets you in the majority of the commuter trains in the bigger cities like Tokyo and Osaka; that's a real convenience to not have to figure out the correct ticket price to purchase rather than just being admitted to the station. Using those trains to get around will eat several dollars every day. Also, the JRPass tickets come in one week durations (7-day, 14-day, 21-day). The cost for a 7-day JRPass is almost identical to the price of a round trip shinkansen ticket from Tokyo to Osaka. So, you only need one decent sized side trip each week to more than pay for the cost of the pass. But, if you're going to get a pass, I'd advise making the most of it. We're planning a two week trip to Japan next year where we'll spend a week based in Tokyo and a week based in Osaka. We're planning day trips to Fuji, Nagano, Himeji, Hiroshima, Kyoto, etc., not counting the round trip between Tokyo and Osaka.

Onigiri, yakisoba pan, etc etc, is usually between 100 yen/300 yen. 1 euro and 3 euros more or less.  You just need to get to the seven eleven. Tokyo is more expensive.",6년 전,0,
@Motoko_AHTR, @mattheModest  Japan rail pass doesnt work on the subway. The best for the subway is getting a SUICA or ICOCA card (500 yen/5 euros) with a recharge of 2000 yen (20 euros). Japan rail pass is a really good investment for using the shinkansen (bullet train) I bought mine for 247 euros. And I could travel anywhere.,6년 전,0,

@1983simi,"Me and my husband just recently finally got to go to Japan albeit just for 12 days and we only stuck to Tokyo and Kyoto, because we rather wanted to chill at fewer places than spending most of our time commuting to destinations and changing Hotels. We went off season and didn't find our trip any more expensive than doing city trips to any other larger cities. We were quite surprised the trip turned out a lot less expensive than we had expected.  We opted for budget hotels at around 80 to 90 Euros a night, both quite central and perfectly connected via metro. If we had been still in our 20s we might have gone for even cheaper options (hostels and capsules) which were also available in plenty around our travel time (late November, early December). But in your late 30s you kind of appreciate a bit more privacy and can afford it. We used the JR Rail pass for our commute from and to Narita. You are right, that airport is a pain to get to and from, but with NEX which is included in the JR pass it was both easy and comfortable and the flights to Narita were a whole lot cheaper than to Haneda. As we were also planning to go to Kyoto via Shinkansen (Hikari line is also covered by JR Rail Pass) it fit together perfectly that way. As for commuting within cities we got ourselves two Welcome Suica cards at the airport (I think this tourist version is pretty new) and charged 5000 yen on each of them. We used it extensively both in Tokyo and Kyoto and still had each 1000 yen left at the end of our trip, so we could have even charged it with less. We only used cabs four times, that is to get from Tokyo/Kyoto station to our Hotel and back with our luggage and our hotels were always close enough that it was never more than 2000 yen. As for food, it was literally just like European prices, you go for pricey food you get a 100 Euro bill, you go for down to earth cheap food you get a 15 euro bill. Towards the end we really tried hard to spend our coin that we had brought along in cash on souvenirs and gifts, unwilling to exchange our yen back and lose more in the process. We still ended up taking quite a few bills back home with us. Now we're saving them in hopes we'll get to go to Japan some time again.  Seriously, we live in Mumbai, I am originally from Munich, we also lived in San Francisco and Santiago de Chile before, also we traveled to Paris, Madrid, London, New York and other comparable cities. At least as long as you stick to well connected bigger cities Japan is really not more expensive than any other bigger city worldwide. Frankly, as for food we felt prices were on perfectly European level. Mumbai and San Francisco can be way more expensive in that regard. Commuting was easily cheaper than Munich both with cab or metro. Hotel prices also were on average European level. But again, mind we came really off season. I am sure for Hanami and the likes you'll be shelling out triple for accommodation. Else it really depends on how high you want to spend. If need be you can eat very cheap (like Ramen was a go to for us, cheap and fills you up good. wouldn't recommend every day though or your arteries will scream in agony).  Anyway, for the longest time in my mind Japan was a travel destination I felt was too expensive for me, cause that's the image created about it. But seriously the biggest part was the flight itself, rest all was just like any other bigger city trip.",5년 전,0,

@katya_fhs,"When it comes to buying airplane tickets: I put all of my regular monthly expenses on the same credit card (bills, supermarket, etc), and just pay it off immediately after my purchase so I don't accumulate interests. That way I accumulate a lot of reward points on that same credit card, and I end up having a lot of them that I can use towards the purchase of airline tickets.  When it comes to food, if I'm staying in a place where I can cook, I do so as often as possible from simple recipes I already know well. I don't know how it is in Japan, but in a lot of places buying stuff at the supermarket and cooking is cheaper than eating out, and that way you can splurge on a few really nice dinners out without going out of your budget.",5년 전,0,
