@katherinegeorge4945,Go to Ffald-y-Brenin in Wales.  It's a Christian retreat where many people have experienced miracles and encountered God's love.  Read The Grace Outpouring that is about Roy Godwin the founder and how God lead him to open Ffald-y-Brenin.  I went there once and although I didn't experience the touch from God I was hoping for I did witness something miraculous.  All the sheep were dotted around the hillside and suddenly at the same time they all started heading towards the cross on the hill that Jesus had told Roy Godwin to have erected.  The sheep literally huddled around the cross for about ten minutes before all dispersing again.  Jesus is the good Shepherd.,3년 전,0,
@katherinegeorge4945,There is a documentary called Transformations that shows the Transformation of four different geographical locations where Christian intercessors fasted and prayed for God to come.  Often there were demonic strongholds of witchcraft that needed to be broken before God could move and one of those places was in Colombia where drug cartels got arrested and whole stadiums worshipped Jesus and the governor dedicated the land back to God.  Another place people were worshipping in a church and they heard what sounded like a jet plane but they didn't have planes flying in that place and they turned the stereo down and the noise kept coming and they turned the recording device off and it kept recording and God came in power and everyone was repenting and getting set free.,3년 전,0,

@Lesiba2,"at this point I think Pablo had his head up his ass because he thought that since he managed to get government to bow to him, he could toy with them by breaking his own deals with government who agreed for the sake of the safety of Colombian citizens. The other thing is that Colombia had too much pride to let USA bring in their muscle to bring this man down. Many lives could have been saved if the government had asked for military assistance from USA, he would have been captured and killed a long time ago with airstrikes, along with his pathetic family and sicarios",4년 전,0,
@jamtv6714,Maybe. If Pablo did'nt joined the Congress and stay low. Maybe he's still running the Medellin Cartel. Politics is very dirty. That's why they dig his past. And they find out that he's a drug trafficer. That's his biggest mistake. Pablo Escobar made so many mistakes in his career. And i think his 2nd biggest mistake is when they escaped La Cathedral. If he just only choose to live. He will surely be alive today. If he didnt escape and let himself handed to the authority.,4년 전(수정됨),0,

@bethm5791,It’s amazing. Most prisons have guard towers to keep the people in. Pablo had guard towers at the jail he built to jail HIMSELF in and had guard towers to keep people out. The jail inside jail gets me. He knew he could at least partially handle business for those five years here. I don’t even get why he didn’t just do the 5 years. It was five years at his jail. And then he wouldn’t be sent to the States. I get business was not the same without him but clearly he had SOME business there. The walls and the floors of these buildings are where I would want to see inside of. I’m sure there are hidden rooms and safes. I know lots of money has never  been found. But everything of his was double concrete for safety. So good luck getting into it. And he didn’t trust. So I’m sure most people didn’t know where he may have kept stuff,4년 전,56,

@Meg-a-ByteTara-Byte,He left because the American authorities had gotten involved and were pushing for extradition. They were backing him into a corner and his first response was to negotiate. But when they stated sending in reporters and putting him in a position where he would come out and turn himself over or they would come in and get him... but the intention of the us was that he was going back with them. And he had other plans. And he fleed and never was on again. After that he was on the run until he died,3년 전,0,
@chrisbuckley1785, @Meg-a-ByteTara-Byte  4 of his enemies were tortured and killed in his prison. Then the Colombian government wanted to move him to a regular prison and he went on the run instead. That was only a year into his sentence. Had he kept that stuff out of his prison he would've done the 5 years just fine. The US government was putting pressure on Colombia. They didn't care much. In fact that was the deal they made to not extradite him to the USA. Spend 5 years in (his) prison and he would be a free man in Colombia. Once it was discovered he was not only living a lavish lifestyle behind bars but still torturing and murdering there wasn't much they could do. He brought it on himself,2년 전(수정됨),1,

@dipakbagda0470, @johnweak3198  what happened?,4년 전,1,
@johnweak3198," @dipakbagda0470  It's kind of impossible to elaborately write it down here. But CIA & DEA themselves were involved in kiki's kidnap, torture and murder. Kiki's chief Jaime Kyukendall is shown to be so much concerned about kiki in narcos, but in fact he allegedly received a huge bribe to aid in kiki's kidnap. Also it is shown that what happened to kiki was consequences of what he did to rafael Caro quintero's weed plantation, but in fact kiki came to know about CIA's involvement in drug and arms trade. He started to know too much so he had to be silenced. A CIA agent was present in the premises during kiki's torturing. You should search for Hector Berellez's interviews and articles who was the chief investigator in kiki's murder. There were numerous tapes uploaded on youtube about it but are now taken down. You know obviously why they would be taken down. Kiki was killed by his own people, dirty politics. Narcos just glorifies the criminals.",4년 전,1,
@johnweak3198," @dipakbagda0470  Also Hector Berellez offered Eric Newman to be an advisor for the show narcos. Since Hector was the chief investigator he should have been included, but they did not. Narcos is just a coverup by netflix for the dirty deeds of the agencies & government.",4년 전,1,

It's a shame such beautiful countries are stripped of resources and exploited. Columbia still hasn't recovered and it's been 30 years since Pablo was retired on the roof. That's the damage drug wars cause, it creates a divide amongst people that normally could and would work together. Just imagine Pablo Escobar got into coffee instead. The government would have worked with him, and he could have helped to maximize the economy of the country they live in and neighboring countries around it and Columbia could have been the Paris of south america.

Obviously, this is a huge part of Colombian history, but with so many lives affected by this mans actions, anyone who goes on a tour like this one has a huge responsibility to learn and share Colombia's story responsibly. Also to realize that the violence didn't start OR end with Escobar.  The country has overcome a lot and it's important to share history and learn history responsibly.  I met so many people whose lives have been hurt over and over by Escobars actions, and actions of the Guerrilla groups that were active at the time, and it's important to realize how bad Escobar was. Colombia is an AMAZING and resilient country and the people are some of the strongest and most positive I have ever known.

@GG-xe1sj,Molly Ascot I’ve never watched it actually. I always liked the Spanish version better so I didn’t want to watch the Netflix one. The money is definitely rotten by now. Not to mention inflation has sky rocketed in Colombia and US. So whatever’s left is not worth as much if anything. $10 in the 90s is $19 today. But since it’s underground and not somewhere building interest it’s worth a lot less money. Hope that helps.,5년 전,3,

Never!  Conclusion  Pablo Escobar was NOT a Hero ,like hsow him in Holkywood Films or Ne5flix , the really was  he was a criminal,  he was a very intelligent person but he used his intelligence to do evil to be a bad person  A few Colombians can be admire him anf foreigbers however the kind of minimun people are igmorants  because they didn't live the  violence  created by Pablo Escobar",6년 전(수정됨),0,

He killed a lot of people to maintain his power and influence (police, journalists, his competitors etc.) But still, he is praised by some group of people, even today (because he funded the poor people of Colombia, schools, hospitals. And of course by his extreme methods of taking power). Because of him thousands of Americans suffered from drug addiction and died from it. He killed a big group of civilians and police in his own country who tried to stop him.  I don't appreciate his actions, and i don't understand those who take a page from him because he was so rich and powerful, turning a blind eye on how he did this.

Pablo called his son, and his son knew that he shouldn’t use a phone. But his father Pablo kept calling him. 8 times. Pablo talked always about his death and how he would kill himself, if it would happen. So his son Juan knew his father is risking something. He kept declining the phone call until he accepted it and talked to his father, the moment they spoke with each other they found out where Pablo is hiding. He wanted to kill himself, thats why he called his son. And he wanted them to know where he is doing suicide, so they can find him. The government says that they killed him. But it wasn’t the case. His son is denying it. Because he got shot in the ear. Pablo told his son Juan that if he’s killing himself, it wont be the mouth or somewhere else, he would straight up shot in his ear. So it all connects. He wanted the cops/military to find him thru the phone call and also say goodbye to his son. And 10min after he shot in his ear. And he was dead.

@katerinearias2879,"My country is a magical place! Not only we produce the best coffee and the most delicious food.

Colombians are the only people that even if you don’t know them, they will make you feel like you’re between family. The abuelas will treat you like you’re their own blood (if they like you) lol.  There is this half Japanese/Colombian guy called Yokoi Kenji Diaz that created what he calls “Social Tourism”. Yokoi brings depressed suicidal Japanese adults to Colombia, of course they see all the beautiful malls and luxury stores, parks, etc... but what really touch their hearts are the moments they share with the families they are assigned to. These families are located in one of the poorest neighbourhoods in Bogota (capital of Colombia). Even though they don’t have many material things to offer, they show the Japanese the one thing that they are missing in their lives... love, happiness, affection! How the simplest things and actions can make your life much more happy... Yes, we have a sad horrible past... but believe me, nowadays that doesn’t represent what Colombia is  and offers to the people “brave” enough to go visit... If you’ve ever met a Colombian then you understand the pride we carry when we said we were born in the most beautiful country!  TE AMO COLOMBIA 💛💛💙❤️",6년 전,0,

Colombia in the late 70s was a poor country with a stable democracy in the middle of other USSR-leaning countries during the cold War. I don't see any feasible need to badly destabilize Colombia on one side and flood Florida and the US with cocaine for political reasons. I'm totally against ""war on drugs"" which is clearly a world failure but I think the Medellin Cartel phenomenon was simply what it was... a criminal smuggler saw the opportunity to make millions, was in a fertile enviroment, the world had no clue to how much mass distribution of cocaine could be a success (cocaine was diffused in Europe since the early 1900s but on a very small and elite scale, it wasn't illegal and would be brought in on regular tourist ships in few kilo batches for the amusement of high profile nightclubs in Paris, Berlin and London and so it stayed till the late 1960s).",5년 전,2,

@LB-zp5bc,"Money+power=control   I often wonder what his vision would have been for Colombia had they allowed his dream of being the president to come to fruition.

@LB-zp5bc,"Now all he sees and hears is weeping and gnashing of teeth. While he lived in divers pleasures, violence and outrage, the Lord judged him for his unrepentant sins… God definitely avenged all the innocent children that Pablo killed in his wrath.   I know he was a narcissist & megalomaniac, but in some ways I admire him. He was a criminal mastermind and made the law obey/submit to him. It’s outlandish and preposterous to achieve, that is why he had to die. He was an aberration to humanity. We only got to see his bad side of the conflict, but if they gave him the opportunity, I believe he would have done right by his ppl.. He would have used his power for the good, he didn’t have anyone opposing his desire & he would have given more to the economy. I don’t think they were prepared to dismiss his vision…they could have prevented an all out war from the very beginning. There was pride on BOTH sides—the law and his. But his pride prevailed….

@RealRicheyy,No one could get Pablo but himself,2년 전,0,
@LB-zp5bc," @RealRicheyy    Pablo Escobar was a coward. He wasn’t “intelligent” like everyone thinks he was. He was born and raised in the streets and came from a poor community. When you come from poverty you learn how to survive. He stuck to what he knew. That’s the reason he was so desperate to stay in Columbia, bc he knew if he got extradited to America the gringos weren’t going to play those games and he was terrified of the consequences. He had a lapse in judgement at the end of his life. He basically f*cked it up for himself. Maybe he was tired of being a coward and hiding, maybe he made a mistake, but on the other hand what he did make clear is: he would rather die in Colombia than become a piece of property in another man’s country. In some ways it’s honorable, but in most ways it just shows us how weak a man rlly is without Christ. Eventually a man’s sins will be recompensed (rewarded) and all the evil you did to others WILL catch up with you. It was God’s judgement. “It’s appointed unto man once to die and after this the judgement.” God ALWAYS has the final say… So what is the best piece of wisdom for mankind? Fear God and depart from evil. Period. Who can stand against God and win? 🤔",2년 전,2,

Pablo was talking to his wife Tata giving responses to news interviews (whilste Tata wrote it down) and the agent in the van saw him at the window and had gotten the police force and many others to pin him down and the president said if he kills kill him. Pablo was all about publicity and wanted Columbia to know he was KING and because he had only Limon too protect him Pablo died on the roof.... If you search up Pablo escobar roof he died on. you can see it.",6년 전,3,

What is rarely address in most movies or documentaries, is the reason men like him become so powerful? The insatiable appetite for drugs in the US! Most drugs are consumed in the US, with that in mind, the US is the problem not the solution. Even after they killed him, nothing changed.  The Cali Cartel took over and now, it's moved to Mexico. For every drug dealer killed, 10 are waiting to take their place. I do believe legalization is part of the solution. Paraguay and now Canada are leading the way.

@papasmurf5431,"There's a a bit of misinformation from the ex-drug dealer. Mostly what he's saying is correct but the details are slightly off. First, Pablo had many houses in Medellin either owned by him directly or owned by own of his associates that were really his. The apartments that Pablo's family stayed in while he was on the run was called Altos del Campestre. Also, at his La Cathedral while he did escape his prison the direction the ex-drug dealer pointed to, Pablo had cabinas built over there on the mountainside. But he regularly threw parties/stayed at those cabinas. ""Popeye"" was one of Pablo's men that was holding Eduardo Mendoza, a government official, hostage and that's why he wasn't with Pablo. When the ex-drug dealer said he was killed shortly after his escape that wasn't necessarily true. He escaped July 22, 1992 and was killed December 1993 so more than a whole year after he escaped. Lastly, Pablo was shot in the leg and the back (below right shoulder blade, so that's true). The last shot went through right ear, and through the front his left ear. It's sounds plausible he could have killed himself, except there was no gun powder marks on his skin from the autopsy. Pablo was probably executed three to four feet away by one of the police officers or US operatives sniped him, so that could be true. Also, Colonel Oscar Naranjo, Chief of Intellience of PNC,  (national police that tracked him) admitted Pablo was executed after he was struck in the leg and back :/",7년 전,1,

There will be elements of truth of couse but for instance the guy tells extreme detail of what supposedly happened then to say 'I don't know I wasn't here'. By the way Escobar isn't the wealthiest,  most powerful criminal or even drug lord of all time.

@VHSKisten,"Keelan O'Connell Grow the fuck up and smell the roses indeed... Nearly every reason you stated, is happening  only because the government insist on outdated prohibition, and in Marijuana's case to protect the pharma industry, even if they're actually pushing alot worse drugs, compared to any of the usual illegal drugs.   People go out of their mind,  because of cutting agents used by criminal organizations to boost profit, and/or completely different drugs gained opposed to expectations.  As many tests show on say street heroin, that contains no heroin, but pure poisonous Fentanyl cut with even cheaper and more dangerous filling agents.  All of this is only happening because the policies enable criminal entities to do so,  that is the only effect you gain from prohibition.. more gangs and criminals profiting from it, and they profit bigtime! no other income can replace the drug business for 99% of the gangs out there.     It wasn't different when alcohol was prohibited, crime syndicates made millions on smuggling and bootlegging it.. It never stopped or changed the supply or demand, but alot of people died as a direct result of the prohibition, and the negative effects it caused, just as it do for most drugs today.    Yes you can seriously fuck your life up on drugs if you cannot control yourself,  but again most of these cases go unheard, because the addicts are afraid of repercussions due to the laws and taboo.  You could fix all of that with legalization, a monitored and regulated market that would ensure purity and safety, and stripping of the propaganda, that makes clueless people like you make such uninformed comments.",7년 전,12,

Lots of people do drugs, but still have a perfectly normal work and family life.  The people that mess themselves up would have done it either way, with another drug such as alcohol.   We hardly have any crackheads here, because it's not available, nor is there a demand, but what we do have instead is ALOT of drunks, simply because alcohol is the cheapest drug here... the majority though are just smoking hash and never have a single problem, opposed to all the people dying and massacring their bodies from drinking alcohol, provided from your local supermarket drug den.

They enjoy harming others for the money, for the image, for the reputation. I don't really know many dealers that isn't sketchy af especially when it comes to new faces which can send one off into paranoia and murder. Then there's addiction itself, sure you can addicted to anythingbut why is it that drugs are the ones that people can easily get attached?

@isaacshusters1620,Fun fact about edificio mónaco: One night a rival cartel blew a car bomb really close to it and the blast woke the WHOLE city up. Pablo's daughter was deafened. My mom (along with other el pobaldo residents) had been stunned by the sound and needed attention but didn't dare to leave the house.  She has also told me stories about how she saw 2 live shootups from people in motorcicles to mitsubishi monteros (the car that rich drug involved inhabitants would have at the time) while waiting in a traffic light.  There was also a car bombing in parque lleras(party zone of one of the richest part of town) 14 years ago where a close friend from my family sadly passed away.  I'm glad Medellín has showed amazing progress in the last decade  Keep up the extraordinary work guys and next time you are in town be sure to let me know!!,7년 전(수정됨),157,

If you don't let you understand what crypto is and what bitcoin is about to become, you will soon hate yourself for not paying attention. When I started trading CRYPTO I lost 3 bitcoins, it was devastating, I got lost until I found a comment on Mrs Lisa Forbes, contacted her and she promised me she would help me not only to recover the money I lost, but to earn the rest of my life. I have earned 16 bitcoins in less than 3 months from their transactions. He is so competent, honest, consistent and very experienced, contact him via WhatsAap (+19173963966) I have a lot of experience in Bitcoin trading but still I use Ms. Liza Forbes  just to be on the safer side signals for trading.",4년 전,0,
