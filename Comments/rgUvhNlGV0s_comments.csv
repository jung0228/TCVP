Come next May (or sooner) I bet they announce that his show will continue after all. Otherwise, why not end the show sooner….I’m just getting a vibe from this network move. Just saying.",3개월 전,0,

I’m one of the idiots who fell for it all hook line and sinker. I fell for the anti Trump lies and voted for Biden.

Also, there are almost always stunt people in the credits, even in a few movies I have seen where I wouldn't call anything I saw a stunt.

All this crap going on about January 6th and the investigation of Trump's home in Florida is more propaganda in forcing the childlike mentality of the people in this country to hate him and NOT vote for him.

Seems like years since he's not been an obnoxious leftist dummy lol I'm still rooting for Trump or DeSantis in 2024 though Vivek and Pence are nice too, Larry Elder as well, but DAMN do I like RFK jr!  Anti-establishment, all the way, drain the swamp whether it's a Republican or Democrat that does it! FBI is corrupt and needs to be fixed! Biden corruption and PROPER punishment for Hunter has yet to be seen! And the constant witch hunts and hoaxes and fake news BS like 'Russia collusion' and the 'Hunter laptop is Russian disinformation' LIES that the Democrats and mainstream media and FBI and probably Stephen Colbert as well ALL shared in that lie to MANIPULATE AMERICANS FOR THE SAKE OF THE 2020 US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION!  So yeah... fuckin' eh... no more establishment swamp-sucking pieces of filth like Joe and Kamala and Pelosi and Schumer and Schiff. They're anti-freedom, anti-gun, and thereby FUNDAMENTALLY anti-American rat bastards, the lot of them.  The Culture War carries on, and I am proud to stand on the side of truth, honesty, morality, and THE WELFARE OF CHILDREN which modern leftists in the West want to dispense with as rapidly as possible to chop bits off and to suppress such movements as 'Sound of Freedom' lest their buddies like Epstein struggle to find fresh kids to use for the likes of Bill Clinton and Bill Gates and those who run CNN.  Well, not the guy who organized that EPIC Trump Town Hall which was fantastic and had the audience QUICKLY laughing at Trump's demeanor and honest comments including calling that nasty woman... a nasty woman.  People find humor in honesty, no wonder people love Trump, and all the more, no wonder the left hate them because they hate nothing more than truth. Truth is their enemy, because they rely on ideology and lies instead of truth. No morality. Just Marxism. Just evil. Just lies. Just deception. Just corruption. Just... children...  I stand opposed to evil which is why I am on the right, and have been active for about a decade and a half or close to it in working AGAINST the left. I've even advanced to the point of moving from 'I am proudly not pro-LGBT' to 'I am anti-LGBT.' I am an LGB bisexual and I reject the 'LGBT movement' and the false Marxist concept of an 'LGBT community.' Only for the far-left, and 'allies.'  I am no ally to those groomers, promoting 'drag queen story hour' and children taking off clothes on stage to throw around while adults throw money.  If things continue as they are, it will enter the mainstream far-left movement to allow children to consent to MORE than """"""mere"""""" double-mastectomies, having their dangly bits turned inside out, and being rendered forever sterile via the hormone DRUGS that those groomers are trying to pump those kids with. I reject the lies, the manipulation, the falsehoods, and the evil.  The silent majority is growing less silent, and I will do anything and everything I can conceive of to ENCOURAGE THE MAJORITY TO SPEAK OUT! I think the left likes to assume that they're as screwed in the head as them, the silent majority... nah. Ask Anheuser-Busch. Ask the underaged students in schools resisting pride month and rainbows and all that crap. A brave boy going with a t-shirt that says ""Only 2 Genders.""  Free speech, it is worth more than my life, as is freedom itself more broadly as a concept. God said fear not, and well, I'm on the edge of homelessness AGAIN because of the anti-oil BS left-wing politics handing over power to Russia and Saudi Arabia and cranking up prices here which when gas prices increase so do the costs of transportation and THAT will inherently cause EVERYTHING to be more expensive INCLUDING FOOD and now they're ALSO trying to legislate (force at the barrel of a gun) for farmers to use less fertilizer so as to produce less food so as to further aid in we poor who are barely hanging onto... food and housing... to tumble down and suffer and hopefully just off ourselves or conveniently starve to death or freeze to death in the winter due to electricity prices (of which, our electrical grid IS NOT capable of replacing all gas vehicles with electric vehicles and WON'T BE ABLE TO within our lifetimes including your children's lifetimes, but hey, screw the poor, you gotta be able to virtue-signal on social media that you 'support the current narrative,' so good for you.  And who knows, leftists... maybe someday you'll be able to wash the blood from your hands, but I think you'll find that it stains worse than oil ever could. Deep down... deep deep deep... right to the soul... and ignorance is no excuse just as it is with the law.  It is advised to stand up and leave evil, even if evil with threaten you if you dare try, and if you DO leave evil, they will try to destroy you just like they try to destroy right-wingers like me.",2년 전,0,

@OOBEJuanKenobi,"If you believe ALPHA psychology is mentally stronger socially, consider this:  - Child sex trafficking rings - Child molestation / child porn - Rape - Murder - Statutory rape / manipulative to younger members of the opposite sex  - predatory psychology (manipulates human beings with low self worth that don’t understand the true intentions of others)  - parasitic (gives attention to peaceful individuals and picks fights unprovoked) - Racism while blaming others for being the only ones that are racial  - Head games with younger personalities  - Head games with sensitive (friendly and honest) personalities - Head games with the opposite sex - Forced car confrontations / car fatalities / head games while driving / road rage - Governments / censorship online to protect hatred, elitism, and authority - Drug dealing crystal meth / cocaine / fentanyl / other toxic drugs that ruin lives - All violence, war, and jealousy  - Anti-science / pro-religion - Anti-psychic / pro-manipulation  - Anti-love / pro-money (power) - No character / only selfish - Never grows in personality / never changes beliefs or ideas to the positive (for life)  - Groups together in social cliques to share criticisms / shares jealousy with others / judges sensitivity (psychic development) in others - Forcing classism and criticisms on those already in pain from the judgments of other people to boost self worth  Ice cold, hard, insensitive, arrogant, forceful, aggressive, disrespectful, bossy, & authoritarian thoughts / ideas / feelings are creations in the material realm.  With warm, sensitive minds, fields, and personalities, none of these issues exist. It’s unnecessary drama.  Is alpha psychology strong while sensitive personalities are weak? Or is that manipulation and a lie? These are creepy behaviors socially.   Sensitive minds are friendly, not manipulative. Sensitive means: “I care about other people.” Alpha means: “I am here to dominate socially.”  Nice guys will always single another personality out romantically and stay. Head games are not a necessity here on Earth when human beings center on each other romantically and show complete honesty to each other. There is no reason for authority.  Pushing self or others to be alpha turns the human mind crazy. Alpha psychology is hatred for others only… Selfish thinking only…  Governments are only necessary for simple and shallow minds that refuse to be friends with other people on Earth and cooperate socially.  Authoritarians are too dumb to get rid of the government. They created it in the first place. Sensitive minds will get there.   Minds focused authoritarian and alpha live a fantasy version of reality. No one has control over the personalities of other people.  Stupid minds are into force (division). Strong minds are into collective consciousness (telepathy and friendship). Be strong.   https://youtu.be/OKCblhVxdEo",3년 전,0,

@justaskin8523,"How did THIS get suggested by my viewing habits?  This was a stinky cringefest of bad acting and zero humor.  And it was BORING!  Willis, stop trying to do humor, it's not your thing.  And stop trusting this dude to make you look good on late-night television, it's not his thing!  Humor is also not Colbert's thing either, but they keep paying him for something, I guess.  I hope I never see something so lame ever again.  Imma be over there watching Dry Bar shows.  At least they have actual humor in them by hard-working ACTUAL comics.",3년 전,1,

However this four minutes took my attention much more than a 2 hour movie. This American Hollywood can really put you in a parallel reality of which waking up is almost impossible. It is maybe America The Land of Thousand amd one Nights after being the land of Opportunities. I think it was 50% for real and 50% made up. And Hollywood will approach Bruce Willis again.

Just Google it! 22 million people used to watch Jay Leno and Carson. Only 2 million watch Colbert and Kimmel. Why? Because Carson and Leno did not get political. Colbert and Kimmel do get political, like every night. Nobody is going to sit down to be entertained and have there favorite President or say Sports team mocked and torn to pieces every night!

My first question is: Are you against violence and hatred speech and the factors and motives that incite violence and hatred?? Your answer is: of course we are!... absolutely yes!!  My second question is: Are you a supporters and encouragers of so-called personal freedoms, freedom of demonstrations, and freedom of expression of opinions, freedom of religions, equality between men and women and same sex marriage?? Your answer is: of course we are!... absolutely yes!!  My third question is: Is the death penalty abolished from your judicial systems because you consider it as a savage barbaric act and not suited to the contemporary man?? Your answer is: of course it is!... absolutely yes!! My fourth and final question is: What do you do to the murderers? Where do you place them?? Do you put them in a resorts you call it jails!! in order to eat the best food and to exercise sports and to practice fitness on the latest sports equipments, and to watch TV and to use the Internet and to read books, magazines and newspapers in their clean place which equipped with a central heating and cooling all the times, and always you provide them a health care at all levels, And from time to time you supply them a new outerwear and underwear and pyjamas and perfumes and new shoes, and you protect them around the clock ,and no anybody has the right to touch them badly at all or to threaten them or to abuse them physically or verbally ,and nobody has the right even to annoying them or to disturb them at any time ,and on top of all of that they are not demanded to pay a cent for the costs of that wonderful life, but in fact the families of their victims are demanded to pay the costs for all of that from their own looted money which you call it TAX?? Your answer is: of course we do!... absolutely yes!!   Well.... according to your answers, it is very clear and it is very obvious that Without a feeling, and without noticing, and unintentionally you are the ones who definitely creating the environment for the existence of violence, hatred and crimes, and you are the ones who inciting and encouraging all of that to be existed continuously and to be spread and to be exacerbated.  Now listen carefully what I am going to say ….. Allah is the Lord of the worlds, and he is the Creator of the worlds, and all the human beings are one of His creations, Allah has graciously revealed His mercy to mankind , His mercy is the Religion of Islam ... and the Quran is the Words of Allah which are addressed to all human beings, Quran is a sacred and a Holy words, It is the Constitution from the Creator to the people , The whole Quran is a completed and integrated unit...it is cannot be followed and obeyed some of Quran verses and ignore the rest , in order to please people and to satisfy them!. The non serious striving by a visible ways to implement all God's constitution in the whole earth means a disbelief in God and a hypocrisy in its clearest form ... and it means the recognition and the acceptance of the existence of crimes in all forms in everywhere...and that will be the reason for the destruction of all human societies in all their differences. The serious striving by a visible ways to implement all God's constitution in the whole earth means a real protection and a real preservation to all people in everywhere.  Do you find up to this point that these words inciting violence, hatred and terrorism!?... Or you think the denying of God's existence and to his constitution and to eradicate Islam religion would be the best option and the superior choice ?!.. In order to embrace your laws and to please you and to satisfy you and to avoid your anger and to be that a clear obedience to your laws which inciting the ignorance, crimes and corruption in the whole earth.. Which been created by God.. And which only God own it !!  Blessed be Allah who says : (( Is it the laws of the time of ignorance that they desire? Who is better than Allah in judgment for people who are certain?)) , Allah is the Lord of the worlds and He is the Dominator to his creatures He said : (( Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the unbelievers )) , and He said : (( Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the evildoers )) , and He said: ((Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the sinners)). God does not call for violence and hatred, in fact he encourages and motivates and forces people to live in the earth as He wills...Not to live every person as he likes and wishes ,  Allah is the only Creator...he is our Creator.  No one can understand the God's Justice and His divine logic except those who have the ability to understand and to think and to conceive through the pure logic.  God has wrathed and cursed and prepared a terrible punishment to anyone who believes in some of His words and deliberately ignores the rest of them, He said : (( Do you believe in part of the Book and defy another part? So what is the requital of those of you who do that except disgrace in the life of this world? And on the Day of Resurrection, they shall be consigned to the severest punishment. And Allah is not oblivious of what you do))………………………….   Mazen Alargha",5년 전,0,

@CharlesJohnson-ol8ln,"Stephen Colbert is a sad little man where a funny man used to be on my TV.   He is also highly UNAMERICAN!  As he started his late night show, he departed from good humor to overstate, his feelings about Donald Trump.  Here is what is wrong with that.  It made me turn the dial (or push the buttons) so I don't have to pay attention to an immature, unamerican guy who when all is said and done could be funnier.  I was prepared to give him time to grow into the job.  But as a Veteran,  I have a hard time watching an adult joke show that has become is political platform and not a good one at that..   Colbert,  you are no Letterman, (of course he had more class) You are no Leno either (he also had more class).  You are just a sad little man who thinks he is funny,   I would rather watch no TV than watch a :Jane Fonda type of misinformed piss ant actor!!!!",6년 전(수정됨),0,

All part of the great left-wing conspiracy to make this a globalist country . Stephen will get his just desserts though much like all of them though when their money is not worth anything anymore and they can't have walls around their houses to protect them. You see, walls work for them not for you . You won't see Bruce Willis on his show anymore, though he's not invited. Anybody that supports the president need not apply.

@Daberney,"NCSM:  Mueller didn't say no collusion. He said although criminal conspiracy could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, there were numerous contacts between Russians and members of the Trump campaign (contacts that a number of Trump's people subsequently lied about). As for obstruction, Mueller gave Congress a virtual road map to proceed with investigation and impeachment proceedings based on obstruction of justice---the reason Mueller didn't move to indict is because of a long-standing Justice Department rule that says a sitting President can't be prosecuted.      By the way, in 2016, with jobs numbers continuing to improve under President Obama, Trump claimed the government's unemployment figures were total B.S., and that the real unemployment rate might be as high as 25%. So why the hell should we believe the government's numbers now?  P.S.  What do you mean by ""get ready for another round of losing""? I don't know if you were awake or not, but we won the last round, the 2018 midterms, pretty decisively. Trump's poll numbers look like shit, and not once during his administration has he reached a 50% approval rating, which makes him unique among modern Presidents.  Of course, the Russians will be looking to help him out again, and he just told George Stephanopoulos that he'd happily accept that help (""no collusion, but that doesn't mean I won't collude""), but I still like our chances in 2020, simply because there are more of us than there are of you (as was shown by the 2016 popular vote).",6년 전,3,

I can say with certainty that neither man has been involved in violence that wasn't very carefully scripted and supervised in this millennium.  Neither man has the ability to make that fight one-sided. At their respective ages Colbert could simply outlast Willis.,7년 전(수정됨),2,

@coleoshtamebaghe3606,"Sarah Gardner Okay. I used to watch him on the Daily Show and thought he was pretty funny, but his entire career is now based off eviscerating Trump in the most hateful and arrogant manner. It goes beyond lampooning the president, which is fair game in a free society. He's one of many arms, like Jimmy Kimmel and SNL, of thinly veiled propaganda designed as late-night entertainment. Johnny Carson was a class act and never stooped to their level. For those not on the East Coast or West Coast, we despise Hollywood and their elitist, ""we know better than you"" attitude. As they rake in millions and live in gates communities separated from the real world, they would lecture the rest of us. The truth is, the truth hidden by a hostile entertainment industry, Trump, despite his very visible flaws, is doing great things for this country. The economy has roared back to life, the stock market is soaring, ISIS is demolished, the vast majority of Americans had their taxes lowered, a flurry of bonuses and pay raises are everywhere...do you ever hear about any of this? Of course not. All you hear about a year later is Russian conspiracy garbage from CNN and other fake news networks despite the fact that zero, I mean zero, evidence has been found. It's a hostile media creating a false reality. Read 1984 by George Orwell. This scary dystopian book, where the government and elitists control what you think, has become our reality.",7년 전,1,
@sarahgardner5385,"Yeah, I can understand that. The way his show goes about things, you don't really hear any of the good that happens. The bad things get more views, but it's only appealing to a certain group. As for the Hollywood and wealth, I have to agree with you on most of it.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@scallie6462,"Melissa Murley Really? the people who coined a simple Noun to describe a group of ideological thinkers the scum of the earth? Not the hundreds of rebel armies fighting in Africa to butcher their own people for some shiny rocks you women flaunt to each other? Or how about the pitiful North Korean population which has been brainwashed and starved for the past half century; no their leaders couldn't possibly be on that list. I could keep going but no amount of reasoning or logic can argue with the heavily emotional insult which you have stated.   Also the projection of claiming to have used adjective, as an insult, is rather amusing. Especially when the chosen adjective is 100% applicable to the subject at hand. Like me calling Floyd Mayweather black, and you saying its racist. Am i wrong? Is Stephen Colbert not a liberal? Because it not offensive to call a fish a fucking fish, just likes its not offensive to call Stephen Colbert a liberal when hes a liberal.   Careful guys your stupid ideology is showing.",7년 전,7,
@veon2672,"Scallie __ Be a bit more careful, now. Regarding the second part of your comment, I'm not saying that using the term ""liberal"" is insulting. I'm saying it's odd that it is USED as an insult. Calling someone a liberal, as you said, is not offensive. The points that you're showing are some that I agree with, and it's the point of my comment, so use a bit more caution and read my comment again. I'm not saying it's an insult to be called liberal; using your Floyd Mayweather example, of course it's not insulting to call him 'black'. Because he IS black. HOWEVER, I'm referring to people who would say something like ""Floyd Mayweather is a stupid, black, disrespectful moron who doesn't deserve to make any money."" My problem with that statement of him being black, even though it IS true, is that it's used as an insult. When it's thrown into a group of insults and used in a similar manner, it's reasonable to assume that the person thinks it's an insult. Saying that Stephen Colbert is a liberal is true, but when it's used as ""Stephen is a pedophilic, liberal, over-dramatic waste of breath"" then it's obviously supposed to be insulting. THAT'S what I don't understand. People using the term AS an insult.  Be more careful when you call people stupid. Just because you like insulting people doesn't mean you need to.

@rolandofgilead43," @JackycClark  i've heard it before he retired and it has since stopped cause they don't want to sound mean to the guy.   i think, check out  Kevin Smith's story on the making of Cop Out (2010) and how everyone from the grips to the cast and the crew were happy as fuck when the shoot ended cause they hated working with him.   but to give smith credit when he heard he was retiring and why he apologized for every bad thing he said and he was the 1st and so far only one to do that thus far. anyways my own opinion ? that for some   movies and tv shows he could be assholes to them and others he could be fun to work with. Tarintino comes to mind i haven't really ever heard anything bad said about him during the making of Pulp Fiction (1994) for example or any of his films with Quentin so maybe he has to like the person? i dunno",3년 전,1,

@JAYVEN505,"One actor I can't seem to stand is Bruce Willis.  What a total jerk.  He's just a a normal guy who thinks his shit doesn't stink.  Well he came to New Mexico to pay at Rt. 66 Casino.  He was even late to his own show because he was too busy paying craps.  Well, just because I asked Bruce that I needed his ID for tax purposes since he won a lot of money at the casino that night he had to throw a big fit and make a big scene.  Indian gaming is very different and they have to follow a lot of rules and regulations.  Well one thing I can say is that I got what I needed to save my job and I'm sure he was not happy to show his ID for tax purposes.  Well ever since that happened I threw all Bruce Willis movies in the trash and I have not seen any movie that he has made ever since that incident.  If it was not for people like me back in the day watching TV that his ratings were high he would not be where he is at today.  It's people like us who are the little people who make people famous.  So if there is a movie or some kind of TV show that Bruce Willis shows in I will not go to watch his movies and I will shut off my TV.  Once incident does it for me and I don't have tube treated like crap just because I had to do my job and make sure everything is running smoothly.",8년 전,0,

Camera work is excellent. I can barely see the doubles, particularly due to the strict details provided, therefore proving the Makeup department is worthy of recognition.  It would indeed be extraordinary if they both could perform such stunts. I wonder how many viewers online were gullible enough to buy it. Nevertheless, it's the thought that counts, along with the efforts of the Celebrities being game to the segment.  A enormous KUDO'S for the Stunt Doubles, as they truly are the unsung heros. They do their jobs without any selfish desires, as they know recognition will never come.

The man-child Trump is as unAmerican as it gets. He deserves to be mocked at every turn. And this idea that the media is liberal biased is a load of crap. Mainstream media are owned by corporations who like to make money. And no one makes money faster than the GOP who puts profits above everything, including humanity. The one progressive candidate that would've been great for the average American but terrible for corporations was barely even covered by the mainstream media and he still managed to create an enormous following, far bigger than anything Trump and Hillary did combined.

It was like instant cut off. I drove everybody on that job, driving a cab in New York city is the worst job in all of humanity, the pay is absolute shit like you cannot believe especially around July where you can take home 20 bucks for 12 hours work, no shit, but the celebrities I met is insane. You know Tom Clancy the writer? I drove him and I thought he was a bum as he was carrying all these bags like a bag man on Madison avenue. David Blaine, Mike Tyson, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Paul McCartney, Michael Stipe, Drew Barrymore, Sting, I drove EVERYBODY, Manhattan is nuts when it comes to celebrities, they are all over the place.

My guess, 2 separate sets recording simultaneously, or at separate times and they broadcasted the cut with the actual fight, while the host & Willis interacted in between. You're welcome!

That way, if he did die, they wouldn't have to waste all that money by re-shooting all of his other previously recorded scenes! They could just hire a new actor and carry on as if nothing happened!

I think Stephen Colbert should talk about this to bring attention to the censorship of the internet and how it is against all the 1st amendment stands for. it discourages free speech by saying we wont pay you if you talk about things we do not like, therefor limiting the public on what content we can view. this is censorship in the worst way because it is censoring out knowledge base.  #keepusstupid",9년 전,0,

@TB.....,GREG COLEMAN You can try and spin it as much as you like but your original comment betrayed your sadness.You live an unfulfilling life of despair. Something is hurting you. I think it is a lack of love? Have you been dumped recently? Maybe you  just haven't quite got the social skills to actually mix with people. It all makes sense now.I understand that you are unhappy because you came to me out of the blue trying to insult me over a youtube vid. I didn't come to you...you came to me.So life is so miserable for you right now that you wanted to lash out.I get it.So as I have empathy for you Gregory I wish you well.I hope that you manage to find a woman one day.You have to start though by learning to value yourself first because nobody will respect you whilst you don't respect yourself. So hang in there Gregory.And if you want any tips or help in turning things round for you.Send me a pm and I will try helping you. Good luck mate.,9년 전(수정됨),0,

You came to me remember (possibly through a subconscious desire for human contact). You were just one of a number of Americans who couldn't grasp my inoffensive light hearted joke about a video. You threw out a little petulant jab (because you have poor manners-something that speaks volumes about you current state and also possibly your substandard upbringing).

Now that I've gotten to know you a  bit i can see that you clearly are very sensitive and got more than a  few issues. You have not angered me or made me sulk in any way shape or  form.I have in fact kind of enjoyed beating the living shit out of you  in our little Youtube sparring match. But now that you have sunk to the  immaturity of making online threats , I can clearly see that this is  getting to you. FFS Man jumping on this first thing in the morning is  just insane. I have no wish to further dominate your thoughts as this is  getting a bit creepy. Every other Brit here can see that my original  post to you was meant as a joke but they have told me how you Brits feel  about being told they suck even if it's meant as a joke.So I know  ,unless you are an idiot you also knew my post was a joke.

@TB.....,"GREG COLEMAN The words 'you suck' didn't offend me. I typed in my joke,received a load of comments from crazies who believed I may have stared at the vid for 9 hrs. Funny but also tragic when they are mocking somebody when they cannot see that it is their error. So with sadness I felt obliged to let them know it was a joke and to wise up. That all fizzled out. Maybe a week or 2 went by then you popped up in my mail box... using sarcasm (great I like that) but with an insult. Now, I couldnt fathom why somebody would have a dig. So you have to put it into context of the despair at some who couldn't logically fathom out (9 half hrs??) that it was not serious. So you got a contemptuous response which I regard as reasonable. You took exception to this and it escalated. Nothing to do with being sensitive. Are you saying that 'you suck' ...you was laughing with me? Over here...thats the same as saying 'you are a dick'. If it was said in a different context then with laughter and also regret...I apologise too. If you got insulted you no doubt would retaliate? As the back n forth continued the gloves are off and anything goes.You brought my mother into the conversation but as I say anything goes so fair enough. My approach was to patronise and show contempt but I could tell that you aren't a dim wit. So deep down I couldn't hate you. I FKN DESPISE YOU (joke). So I accept your apology. Likewise I offer mine. From both perspectives we can understand a misunderstanding. You still insulted me in your apology but I will overlook that as you manned up anyway.

@TheBIGGY1966,"You  suck was meant as ""you suck for fooling me"" . Like  I really  believed you watched the video for hours,(sarcasm) Over here ""you suck""  is not really an insult.

Unfortunately you didn't fall for it. I like your humor mate and I knew  you were smart enough to know I was joking in my original comment. I  just didn't understand how ""you suck"" was such a big deal.Kinda like  ""cunt"" is over here.I get it now . As for the yellow teeth remark. I  like Brits so I don't have alot of insults to use on Brits. So I went  with a stereotype.I actually read not long ago Americans on average have  worse teeth than Brits. As for the treadmill. I wasn't lying . I really  am 6'5"" and 240 lbs . Pretty fit weight for my height I think.  The  only thing you said that got to me was the threat. I truly hate internet  threats. Being a rather large frightening looking person I don't get  alot of threats in person. Getting one online frustrates me  because I  can't reach out and choke the life outta the person. Being a boxer you  most likely can understand that. Other than that I kinda enjoyed the  sparring. It's too bad we don't live closer because I've found in life  people you fight like cats and dogs when first meeting usually become  pretty good friends.Or at least people you come to respect. You would  come in handy doing in these Trump supporters that we are dealing with  over here right now. Okay I'm done now. I'll let you and your boyfriend  get back to whatever you two were doing ......(just kidding).  Cheers  mate .

I CAN imagine that there may very well BE actual similaritie(S) whilst alongside various slapstick humorous techniques that are perhaps in some small ways could most likely seem familiar but THIS being said ... ""Family Guy"" is a cartoon (NOT to take anything away from ""it's"" OWN unique merit) which depends largely upon artistic talents such as those who can draw and create while also simultaneously utilizing voice-over actors talents as well as individuals with specialized ranges in their vocal chords in order to be able to convey necessary moods and tones and if need be comedic and/or emotional depths ... Whereas ... THIS ... was recorded in front of a LIVE studio audience and used REAL actors in EVERY way imaginable ... physically, visually, mentally, vocally, etc, etc, etc ... and also just like professional dancers/athletes/stuntman they had to rehearse and practice this over and over again and again and remember precisely what they were going to say and HOW they each were going to move separately and additionally additionally together as a unit of two working as one and also it is essential that their timing had to be in sync in order to prevent them from actually hurting one another ...

The first English use is from Shetland; the term was adopted more widely into English in the mid 19th century.  troll2 trōl/ noun noun: troll; plural noun: trolls 1. a person who makes a deliberately offensive or provocative online post. informal a deliberately offensive or provocative online posting. 2. a line or bait used in trolling for fish. verb verb: troll; 3rd person present: trolls; past tense: trolled; past participle: trolled; gerund or present participle: trolling 1. informal make a deliberately offensive or provocative online post with the aim of upsetting someone or eliciting an angry response from them.

I've never been part of a live recording or (live) showing but, despite my initial position taken re. such (cued rxs) being a thing of the past, i assume 'applaud' & 'stand' etc' cues are still used on shows like this in a ltd manner for instance at the beginning when the host is making their entrance onto the stage or whatever..
