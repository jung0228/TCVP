@Redneck322,Try popping your spine and neck without your hands or twisting your body. I have done that since 2017 and it’s like having the weight of the world dragging you down just disappear.

@rightousnesspursuer6523,"Repent for the kingdom of heaven is coming.   Christ payed the price for our sins, for The most high Father had laid all of our sins on Him.

If you repent from your sins, confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Yahushua ( one you know as Jesus) is king and savior and that He is the son of God you will be saved.  There is a coming wrath upon the earth where The Father will punish the wicked and unrepentant people. Christ will come and save His church from the wrath of The Father.  Please save yourself from this wrath and live a new hope filled life honourable to the Most High by keeping His commandments May the Father bless you all.

@alexandrae5346,"Since arthritis runs in some people's DNA more than others, it's interesting to note that the gas between the joints can actually enlarge the joint, knuckles, and cause displacement. ""Popping"" the gas out, helps reduce the swelling.  Also considering that now they recommend you go to a chiropractor or massage therapy to ""pop"" back joints, again the same gas issue, to help reduce further back inflammation, it's probably a good guess that it's better for all joints when the gas build up is excessive",2년 전,0,

@AlexJefferiesPiano,I’m a professional pianist and was a habitual joint clicker in my high school years. I decided to kick the habit for good (which was really hard to do) before going to music school. Within 3 weeks I immediately saw results and my finger strength improved massively. Joint clicking might not necessarily be bad at least with the current knowledge we have but I found after kicking the habit after 5 years of doing it my fingers got stronger and more agile with far better control at the piano.,2년 전,97,

They always do the reflexive oww, and then realize it didn’t hurt at all. Then they keep coming to me to do it again 😂",3년 전,0,

@joeymcguire8742,"Too bad almost none of the information from this has been accepted by the scientific community. I was told cracking knuckles was bad for me as a kid so I’ve read the actual studies on cracking joints. There is no evidence or scientific consensus for what actually causes the noise. During live scans of cracking joints, what was determined was that there was both the formation and “popping” of gas in synovial fluid. The imaging technology utilized (I believe it was fMRI) could not effectively determine whether the noise occurred at production or removal of the bubbles. I believe the limitation was the scanning technology not having quick enough refresh rates.",3년 전,2,

If you repent from your sins, confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Yahushua ( one you know as Jesus) is king and savior and that He is the son of God you will be saved.  There is a coming wrath upon the earth where The Father will punish the wicked and unrepentant people. Christ will come and save His church from the wrath of The Father.  Please save yourself from this wrath and live a new hope filled life honourable to the Most High by keeping His commandments May the Father bless you all.

@evemii,"The ends of the bones in the knuckle are in very close proximity to each other, with a small space between them called the joint space. This space is filled with a very slippery fluid called synovial fluid. Once enough force is applied to your finger to overcome the adhesion or tension, there is a rapid increase in the size of joint space and a gas bubble forms in the joint space. The noise associated with cracking your knuckles is produced at the same time as the gas bubble forms. Once you let go of your finger, the gas bubble is reabsorbed by the fluid in the joint.",4년 전,0,

Si se revientan o se rompen las articulaciones, probablemente lo haga. ¿Qué les pasa a nuestras articulaciones cuando las rompemos? ¿Y es malo para ti? El líquido sinovial es una sustancia similar a un lubricante que se encuentra entre las articulaciones. Parece una yema de huevo. Entonces, cuando estira la articulación, está liberando gas, y ese gas forma una burbuja. y se derrumba y explota. Para volver a romperse el mismo nudillo, debe esperar unos 20 minutos para que gas para volver a ese fluido. Entonces, ¿en qué se diferencia de un pop que escuchas cuando te pones de pie rápidamente? El sonido que probablemente escuche entonces es el sonido que hacen los tendones cuando se deslizan. entre los músculos o sobre los huesos. Cuando una articulación se mueve, el tendón se rompe rápidamente y hace un chasquido. Entonces, ¿es seguro el hábito de crujir los nudillos? Probablemente. Donald Unger era una especie de investigador que se describía a sí mismo que eligió hacer estallar los porros en una de sus manos durante 60 años, pero no la otra. Y quería saber si hacer estallar los nudillos en realidad le daría artritis. Después de 60 años de hacerlo, descubrió que no tenía más artritis en una mano. que en el otro. Pero aún existe la posibilidad de que no sea bueno para ti. One 1990 descubrió que crujir los nudillos durante un largo período de tiempo provocaba hinchazón de la mano y disminución de la fuerza del scrip, pero no ha habido ninguna investigación de seguimiento al respecto. Entonces, aunque romperse los nudillos puede no ser malo para usted, todavía no hay garantía que tu hábito de hacer estallar no molestará a las personas que te rodean.",4년 전,1,

@BrunisPistol," @BrandonWenneborg  chiropractic is literally a pseudoscience, meaning it is a field which rejects evidence-based study in favor of tradition and anecdotal reports. It's like the first line on the wikipedia page. There are fields of medicine like physical therapy and osteopathy which do the same things better and have actual studies to back them up. It's true there are some chiropractors that use real science in their practice, but ""your only other option is surgery"" is just a lie chiropractors use to keep you paying them. Some doctors are going to want to just operate, but that's why you get multiple opinions for any serious medical decisions",4년 전,1,
