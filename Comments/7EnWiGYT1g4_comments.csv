He cared for his community! Surely If I made these patties for him, I'd become accepted in Gwent community!   I presented these patties to him, he said ""ochujałeś"" which probably meant ""great job! welcome among Gwent pros!"", but then all of a sudden, his moderator jumped out. Patryk was his name.

@angelwhispers2060,Honestly I just always assumed that it was a meat substitute kelp and kelp berries Patty. You have to think when food is pretty rare at the bottom of the sea. Which made me think is real secret ingredient was the fact that he had found a kelp that taste like meat and that's what the burgers are really made of. Perhaps a species of red kelp to get the importantly deceptive red to Brown transition when cooking. Mr Krabs is too smart to go importing rare above water ingredients.,4년 전,5,

@adrianarencibia7780,Actually believe it or not it's actually wrong and he's actually wrong because there is a secret ingredient and obviously the show says it and he said he looked at it online and online is not always right so I believe in everybody else that like Spongebob like myself I'm a fan of the show I believe that this is wrong it's somebody that likes to show I would recommend you and suggest you for not believe what he is saying that is not true and that is not right there's one episode Eugene and Plankton you're the bestest friend and there were kids and the ingredients fall into the recipe for the Krabby Patty and no that's not the secret recipe that's just doing you technically some of the seasonings and also so people can know how and what happened and what was the beginning of the Krabby Patty and how it began that does not mean that is the secret recipe believe it or not it's still not known and there is a new episode that is krabton that is Plankton and Krabs conjoined together SpongeBob said to Bruno customers that little something is Schaumburg really against technically that is because temporary the new owner of the restaurant owning the restaurant for a while and it had some Chum but that doesn't mean it's the secret formula another thing is if you seen the new movie in 2020 the new SpongeBob movie it's actually a song from the movie so the end the song that says the secrets of formula will that song is actually a song and that song is actually don't distract the king to get Gary back and obviously plankton was there so obviously Eugene is not going to say the secret formula also believe it or not is there is some episodes krabton Exedra but there's some episodes that they're still doing the same thing Plankton is doing the Krabby Patty secret formula really that's not the secret is just a song do you YouTubers that's not the secret formula it is not formula is not do anybody that likes to show don't let him ruin your lies that is not true if you seen recipes of how to make the Krabby Patty only no way how to make not the seasonings itself so of course like the bread and the Patty and lettuce tomato how to make not literally how to make it it's just how to assemble it again anybody that that watches the show this is not the secret formula. So again any other channel that has the formula they show you how to make it again that's not really the secret it's just supposedly the way haven't make it in there go the secret again online if I always right and to be honest with you believe it or not. 99 to 100% mostly a part of it is 100% every recipe that you see in YouTube is actually fake. Do in case if anybody reads this comment and they say to me oh no that's not true don't tell me that if you stay that's not true that's incorrect it's still Secret it also the proof is in the episodes everything that I said for this comment against nobody convince me so don't even bother telling me that this is true or not everything I said is true.

@AnotherReactor201,"If we take the creators' word on it, we know the patty itself isn't meat based, so it's not crab or other fish, unless you're from a culture that doesn't count fish as meat. Maybe the reason it's so hard to figure out is because the secret ingredient isn't actually just one ingredient. If we can put together a cohesive backstory for it, we may be able to find clues. We know that Mr Krabs claims it's a family recipe, but we've also seen that Plankton and Krabs were working on it together before random stuff fell into the mixture to create it. I think perhaps, it's somewhere in between. Mr Krabs was using an incomplete recipe of his family that Plankton was trying to complete with chum. It didn't work, but the random mixture combined with the incomplete recipe+chum happened to create the first part of the secret. The patty mix. (Just go with me on this lol) but over the years, we've learnt some of the secret ingredients: flour, barnacles shavings, salt, turmeric, chum and of course the most important ingredient of all is love. We also know there's a secret sauce involved, which is revealed in ""As Seen on TV,"" ""Not Normal,"" and ""Patty Caper,"" and briefly in ""Graveyard Shift.""  The secret is the combination of the patty itself and the sauce and for the patty to be as great as it appears in the show, the combination of both is required.",2년 전,1,

@tjmarx,"A Krabby patty is factually made from crab meat. You see any cows under the ocean?   There is an episode in which we get the full backstory of how the Krabby patty came to exist and why plankton is so obsessed. Turns out plankton put in half the work in developing the patty and Mr Krabs ripped him off.   Nickelodeon have been clear, the patty contains crab meat. It isn't beef.   Please make a real Krabby patty and eat it. I hear it's disgusting to land animals",4년 전,0,

@contentiouscritic,"VanityTL  the spongebob movie he mainly worked on was the first. You can see it in the credits. For the spongebob squarepants movie he is creator / director / writer / story.

Hillenburg resigned as showrunner, but Nickelodeon continued to produce more episodes after he departed the series”   The second movie is not the one he worked on. The first one is. He is not the director or even screenplay writer for the second movie, he’s credited as an EP and “story creator” meaning he created spongebob in general and those are the characters being used.

In Mustard O mines, Spongebob makes krabby patty on screen now the stacking order is this: Bun, Ketchup and mayo, Patty, Cheese, lettuce, tomato, and top bun THEN ANOTHER ONE!

The true evidence that leads me to believe that the secret ingredients is Sea Horse shit is that there isn't anything particular under the sea, nothing expensive or worth buying to selling especially how cheap Mr. Krabs is and seeing as Mr. Krabs knows the business very well, would know that a bigger distribution means an uequal demand either you have a lot to sell or a lot to have and burgers is a major demand with a low price and with having these minimum wage workers it is easy to see the obvious that Mr. Krabs is a cheap greedy businessman which comes to my conclusion Mr.Krabs does not want to pay excavate a secret ingredients, does not want to pay to keep the imgredients maintained and thus would find an easy instrument to supply which would be sea horse shit which is consided Seahorse radish which would be seen in another episode entitled ""Nasty Patty"".

@nolanferris,Plankton made this video,5년 전,1,
@Etherdave,"The producers were forbidden to portray the use of fish as food, due to technical issues surrounding the depiction of cannibalism in an anthropomorphic animated environment. But many fish, as we all know, are avid cannibals, so the idea that the Krabby patty is made from fish is not altogether unsound. Since it is illegal for humans to fabricate a Krabby patty from products reflecting the eating habits of fish, it seems sensible to use food products reflecting the TASTES of fish instead. Since Eugene Krabs is apparently originally from the British Isles, I wonder if the patty is a Welsh lavercake? As for the secret ingredient, well, as dark as it sounds, crabs are largely omnivorous, and Krabs is known for his stinginess (which some refer to as thriftiness), so why wouldn't he use his dead, partially-decomposed relatives in his recipe? It's good umami, and better for you than MSG. Thanks for posting!",5년 전,0,

@sambradley9091," @mineralgrey8332  Actually MSG's history of being seen as dangerous is literally cause of racism. Before the panic about it, it was a common spice used in a lot of Asian restaurants, especially Chinese, because it was discovered in Japan and China soon followed suit using it industrially for food. So one day a dumbass has a headache eating Chinese food and decides to blame it on the MSG and writes to the FDA. The FDA found no correlation between headaches and MSG but it was too late, because ""Chinese restaurant syndrome"" had already began and now everyone had their own placebo effect of assuming there's MSG in Chinese food then ""getting"" a headache from it, even when there was no MSG. And from those myths it then expanded into even MORE insane misinformation, I've literally had someone tell me it causes cancer. Wild.",5년 전,15,

I'm just saying this sounded very racist cause people were avidly avoiding Chinese. The Asians have always been pretty subject to racism by the Western community, so its not surprising it could've been blatant racism instead of just oh, crap its msg runnnnn That's just my take on it, nothing else.",5년 전,2,
@nahometesfay1112," @Lanurus  kinda depends on intent. If the rumor was spread to hurt the reputation of Chinese restaurants that would be racist, but if it was purely about MSG that wouldn't be racist. I guess the litmus test would be whether people are more concerned about MSG in Chinese food than other food.   Separate but related idea:  An important thing to remember is that racism can be indirect for example, possessing crack can lead to much longer prison sentences than possessing cocaine despite being the same drug. While this may no seem racist at first glance, Crack is easier to find in African American communities so it effectively gives African Americans longer prison sentences. The key is that the letter of the law doesn't mention race, but in practice it does.  A much less extreme example is banning braids in the workplace which will disproportionately affect Black women even though such a ban would technically not involve race.",5년 전,0,
@erito9507," @mineralgrey8332  The problem with MSG is that it is really addicting. MSG doesn't make food taste good, it makes you think that it tastes good. The problem is when MSG is placed on low quality food and you can't distinguish low quality from good quality and you just start eating low quality food cause you get addicted because of MSG. Before I went to university I was eating normally at home without overeating but after that I started eating from food stalls and restaurants and I just kept overeating cause I wanted to eat all the time because of MSG and when I went back home my eating habits normalised so I really think that MSG is a problem.",5년 전,1,

@TheMochialVoid,"Seriously, can everyone just leave Win090949 alone. The only reason they are commenting for months straight is because of people who are constantly downgrading and insulting this person. They said it was a joke, so instead of coming back at them and telling them to let it go, how about YOU let it go. Honestly, you're making yourselves look like 9 year old when all this person wants is these stupid hate comments to stop popping up in their notifications. Grow up.  @Win090949, I actually got the joke :P. But tips for next time, if you feel the joke is not easy to catch on, write a note in the same comment that it is a joke so people like these don't come attack you again.   How about this:  Plankton: IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED, YOU HAVE GIVEN ME THE KNOWLEDGE I NEED TO BEAT THAT LAUGHABLE CRABS! THANK HIM EVERYONE!!!- Random fish character : pops up, krabby patty in mouth -don't speak in caps lock. You look like a 9yo Plankton:... Random fish:... Plankton: fool, your demise is inevitable...  (To those who still don't see, Plankton said ""thank him everyone"" but he didn't get thanks, he got an insult :P)  The fact that I just wasted time to make this comment, I'm sorry, I just feel bad for Win090949 :C  You're free now!

@TheMochialVoid," @ambikaodonnell3314  you telling me is pointless to defend this person is pointless itself. I never said they improved the joke and honestly I don't care that it wasnt funny. You can say what you want but I'm not going to stop defending a person who's being hated on for no reason. Ok, they made a bad joke, leave it alone. It's never pointless to defend people unless the person themself considers it pointless and I don't. I don't do this to gain something out of it. If my comment only made this person's day better than whatever,I'm fine with that.  I don't care if there was any point to it at all. I did what I wanted because I wanted to and I don't need someone telling me my effort was pointless because I don't think of it that way at all.   Also, I only commented what I did because people were being insanely rude for no reason. I get those who took their comment as an insult and snapped back but at this point, the person mentioned it was a joke and there are still people who have the audacity to call them a liar and continue insulting them. How about you call that pointless instead?",5년 전,0,
@ambikaodonnell3314, @TheMochialVoid  all I'm saying is that not many people got his joke so for some it sorta downgraded the comment and ruined it. That's the best I can describe how I felt. Stop overreacting with extremly long comments. I'm not sure you understand why people hate him for this. I'm trying to phrase this in the most friendly way I can.,5년 전,0,
@TheMochialVoid," @ambikaodonnell3314  well sorry. I don't think I was overreacting,  I just ""talk"" a lot. I didn't even notice my comment was long. I was just trying to get a point across. And I'm trying to explain it in a friendly way as well. It's not that I don't understand it's just annoying at this point. I'll admit when I first saw their comment, I got a bit triggered as well but after reading the edit, I realized it was a poor attempt at a joke. True, i didn't even have to get involved. I'm sitting sitting here on a random day responding to a comment about a joke relating to spongebob and how someone ruined it. Yes there's nothing better to do xD. You can think what you think and feel what you feel. The only reason why I responded was because you said ""defending him was pointless"" and that triggered me. Whether it was for personal reasons or not, I don't really know, but unless the person who started all was really a grade a ...ahole...pfft I'd say bye a long time ago.   And I think I just wrote another long comment. Sorry, I'm not overreacting I'm just writing...a lot...its a habit. If you seen any of my other comments on youtube, you'd probably notice I write a lot. And then I do stuff like this where i write nonsense. And now this comment is longer. I don't know why I'm not stopping ok lemme just post this and be done lol. Nice day to you I guess xD  It is long oml now I'm embarrased. How many times have I done this?",5년 전(수정됨),0,
@robbieweld7928, @TheMochialVoid  The joke doesn't work because he is addressing the caps lock which is only used to demonstrate that plankton is shouting. If he made a joke relating to what plankton said or the fact he is shouting it might not be funny but it would at least work as a joke.

It's fucking Nickelodeon... they, as well as other creators like Disney are notoriously known to hiding suggestive things in their children movies, and shows. Both dark, and sexual. So, you guys really think THIS is ""too dark"". What about the cannibalistic related things that happen in the show a lot, already! Or all the other dark shit, like hinting Squidward wanted to kill himself.

I dont really know how well wheat amd vegetables grow under water (probably impossible) but if I stretch my imagination itll do, but cows? I dont know man sounds kinda fishy. Whales are mammals right? So I could be completely wrong but wouldnt that mean they produce milk? If so you could make cheese out of it. I also imagine you cam eat whale meat just like any other meat. I think the most probable type of patty and cheese, asuming everything I just guessed is correct, would be whale patties and whale cheese of some sort. I know it sounds kinda stupid, even to myself, but Im doing my best to make sense of the mythical Krabby Patty with my limited knowledge of the sea.",6년 전,0,

He found the all knowing and all powerful Tom Kenny the voice of spongebob who is smart outside of voicing spongebob. He overheard Tom and Bill talking about the secret formula while grilling burgers at home. He collected his information but he was trapped in the real world. He adapted to his new environment and mentally and physically changed. He found YouTube and saw that you could get famous and rich just by uploading and posting videos. He instantly began cooking good food using his new smart brain. So Plankton/Babish became careless and posted a video on how to make a patty.

@dustwarewolf5532,"One thing that I feel should be noted is that there is a high probability that the type of meat that is used for the actual patty component of Krabby Patties might very well be derived from sea cows, which are an alternative name for both manatees and dugongs, as I find it very unlikely that somebody as tightwaded as Mr. Krabs would spend the amount of money that would be neccercary for importing such large quantities of beef to Bikini Atoll, where Bikini Bottom is said to be located, all of the way from Australia and/or The United States, even with both of them being much cheaper sources of beef than other countries are. There is one episode of Spongebob however, the one where he gets a black eye from slipping on toothpaste then lies about it, where Sandy is shown herding a giant herd of about 1,000 by my estimate sea cows, both showing that there is a large supply of sea cows from which meat can be gathered from, and that, unlike inside of the real world, either manetess or dugongs, or possibly both of them, are Least Concern as oppose to Endangered, Also, apparently Sandy has a second job of being a rancher in addition to her being a scientist, but that is besides the point. Also, since manetess and/or dugongs are common inside of The World of Spongebob, it is perfectly moral to eat them in the same way as it is moral to eat land cows within our own world. The very slow rate of reproduction in real-world sea cows wouldn't apply either, since in a world where the natural biology of sea sponges, which are LITERALLY brainless inside of our own planet, have full sapience, it is quite safe to assume that such a comparatively minute alteration inside of the biology of sea cows such as their average rate of reproduction being a lot faster than their real world counterparts, probably about the same as land cows/ actual cows, is probably the case. Be that as it may, substituting sea cow meat for beef is of coarse a neccisity for obvious ecological reasons whenever one wishes to cook up a real world approximation of a krabby patty.",6년 전,0,

Yet fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy doesn't give you a headache, or at least I don't. So people latched on to assuming MSG is bad because they assumed it must be, it's new to them, it's what the Chinese use. Yet it's used constantly over in eastern Asia, but nobody thought about that.  It's only sort of racist honestly. After all, if someone claimed that eating most American foods made them feel sick, I would actually believe them if their diet was more vegetable-heavy and not as sweet as the American diet.

Also, when kids ask their parents why the crabs are eating krab, it’s a great learning opportunity to tell them about the difference and how to avoid fake crab, especially at places like sushi bars.  PS: nothing wrong with putting lettuce directly on the patty between the cheese... IF you don’t like cheese melted and don’t want the lettuce to stay crisp... so for everyone else who’s normal, please don’t put the lettuce between the burger patty and cheese (in fact, go a step further and always serve burgers McDLT style so the cold/crisp produce stays that way and the hot burger and melted cheese stay warm until you’re ready to eat it)",6년 전,0,

Once it goes into your body it just just breaks down into sodium and glutamic acid, neither of which are near as harmful as cyanide.

@Silentgrace11,"There are people who are allergic to MSG, just like there are people who are allergic to many other foods, but not all the people who claim to be allergic are actually allergic. Most of the associated symptoms are a result of eating high amounts of sodium without much water to balance it out (MSG is basically an umami-filled salt, after all) or just a response to the grease, which ends up being misjudged. Emphasis on most, as again, there are some people who are actually allergic to MSG, whether in its chemical form or an allergy to the bacterial fermentation it's typically made from..  Thankfully the amount of people who only associate MSG with Chinese food seem to be fading, though - and these are typically the people who claim that Chinese food make them sick while they frequently eat pre-packaged and otherwise ""convenient"" foods from the grocery store.",6년 전,30,
@Joseph11OG,"All MSG allergies are nocebo affect. People only react negatively when they suspect something contains MSG. If they are sure that it doesn't, there is no negative reaction, regardless of MSG presence. I have done this experiment on my mother multiple times. She swears she gets congestion from MSG every time we eat at a cheap Asian establishment because she assumes they will use MSG. And she really does get some mild negative affects from her own mind. However because she trusts that I would never use MSG in my cooking,  I did so anyways because I've done extensive research on MSG and there is no medically verified allergy toward it.  Every time I've prepared a tasty Asian dish like Chinese stir-fry or Korean bulgogi, I use a small amount of MSG and everyone loves it including my mother. And because she doesn't know I add it, and she assumes I would never do such a thing, she has no negative reaction to it.  At some point I need to tell her though, but it's going to be difficult.",6년 전,4,
@Joseph11OG," @miladsammouh4741  Yes mate and oxygen also kills you eventually.  Yeah, basic molecules can be dangerous. What's your point? Glutamate is far more complex than cyanide or nitrogen, but the reason it is inert in dietary consumption is because it cannot pass the blood-brain barrier. It is a neuroexcitory compound sure, but show me a study that proves that the brain can absorb dietary glutamate. Spoiler You can't because it's too large, the brain has to make it's own.",6년 전,3,

""Oh it's made of these 2 elements/organic compounds and they are found in everything so it's safe!""  Like I said, I am not trying to disprove that msg is safe, I'm just stating his argument was invalid. The way you broke it down made a lot more sense and is an actual point.",6년 전,4,

The whole glutamate thing is irrelevant because I don't think you understood me well. I didn't mean ""basic compounds are dangerous"", I meant what I stated above, ""just because you can break something down into basic compounds that are not dangerous and are found everywhere, it doesn't mean that if you combine those compounds into a bigger one the result will also be safe""  Something like this:  >MSG is made of a and b, so because A and B are found everywhere, MSG is okay!  >Cyanide is also made of C and D, and they are also both found everywhere.

I mean the show will be over but still it took us since the early 90's to try to break that recipe into real life.  But you know i kinda of figured it out the actual material for the krabby patty is actual the name of the restaurant. It's not meat patty they put in it its a krab meat.

Neptune's power can make patties nearly instantaneously, so Spongebob loses out in amount. I think he makes a million krabby patties when Spongebob only makes one.. but he makes it with love. It makes Neptune cry, so SBSP naturally wins. Neptune has a hissy fit and turns Spongebob into a god anyway, which Spongebob then uses against Neptune.

@elliespohr,"A chemical is a chemical. Artifically synthesized table salt is precisely identical to naturally occuring salt. This is just the way physics and chemistry works. If two atoms of the same element both have their electrons in the same states, and the atoms are both traveling and rotating at the same speed they are essentially chemically identical. They will react exactly the same way to other chemicals. Yes, they are subatomic differences beyond that, but they have no effect on chemical reactions. (This very fact is why it's so difficult to enrich uranium, due to one isotope being a bit more unstable but having only the slightest difference in density due to neutron count.)  Things can get more complicated when you isolate chemicals from naturally occurring plants and animals that we consume, but that is not the case here.  High Fructose Corn Syrup has a different ratio of components to cane sugar and fruit sugar. So um, bad point? Megadosing on sugar, natural or synthetic is not a great idea regardless.",7년 전,10,

@elliespohr,"Morgan, I guess you folks have never heard of the ""placebo effect."" Anywho, MSG stands for monosodium glutamate. It's the salt of glutamic acid, an amino acid present in many, many foods. MSG was not exactly ""invented."" It was discovered that they could isolate it and that it corresponded to its own specific taste receptors on our tongues. In other words, it's a basic building block of something our tongues evolved to taste. It doesn't have a taste of its own per se, but it does enhance the savory perception we get from food.  In double blind trials, this so called headache effect completely disappears. The only danger from MSG that I'm aware of is the same as from ordinary table salt. Namely, it's good to watch your sodium intake in general. It counts towards your daily allotment so you can't just add it on top of salt without being aware of that. At anything approaching a sane amount on your food it is perfectly safe.",7년 전,21,

They were given various foods that either did or didnt contain msg and were told it either did or didnt contain msg, but it wasn't always accurate. Out of that study only 2 people actually showed side effects to food that actually did contain msg. This shows that while in some rare cases the individual may show side effects when consuming larger amounts of msg, in most cases it is a placebo. You could be one of those rare case, or it could be caused by a bias you don't recognize. Regardless msg has as much of an affect as salt to the vast major of people so it's really harmless.

In this case, it's not news that this molecule exists in foods naturally, the problem is that we are synthesizing it and using it against what nature intended, in far larger amounts than naturally occurring, to fool our sense of smell and taste which has plenty of research to back up it's potential harm. But hey! it'll make a killing on the market so why the hell not, right? I'll stick to what nature intended unless it's necessary to my survival. As a professional chef myself, I know there are many other natural ways to make inexpensive products taste amazing. Good luck to you ;)",7년 전,0,

@BioHzrd0010,"Hey Babish, I heard you referencing the Bubble Bass incident a few times, which is appropriate since the clip you showed was from Bubble Bass's episode. But with Bubble Bass in mind, I think you should recreate Bubble Bass's order from the episode. His order was as follows:  ""I'll take a double triple bossy deluxe, on a raft, four by four animal style, extra shingles with a shimmy and a squeeze, light axle grease, make it cry, burn it, and let it swim.""  And if that makes no sense at all, you should know that he was speaking in code. Here's what it means:  1. Double-Triple Bossy Deluxe:   a. Double-Triple = 6 patties   b. Bossy = all-beef   c. Deluxe = everything on it 4. On a raft: Toast in place of burger buns 5. 4x4: Previous 6 patties x 4 = 24 total patties, with another 24 slices of cheese 6. Animal style: Patties cooked in mustard, 24 layers of everything 7. Extra shingles: Extra toast, 2 per layer, 14 total 8. With a shimmy: Jelly spread on toast 9. And a squeeze: Orange juice to drink 10. Light axle grease: Light butter on the toast 11. Make it cry: Extra onions 12. Burn it: Patties are well-done 13. Let it swim: Extra special sauce  Personally, I don't think that sounds very good, but that's because I don't think jelly on a burger is a good idea.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@Runefrag,"Thank you for proving to both me and everyone else that you are indeed filled to the brink with shit conjured up from your own mind. Here's some fun ACTUAL facts for you to hopefully actually research this time and do some pondering on amidst insecurely voting up your own comments.  1. Ground beef has one of the highest recommended temperatures due to their massive potential to carry nasty bacteria like salmonella, as I pointed out in my original comment.  2. The only sure-fire way to know if pink meat is safe to eat is for the temperature of specifically it to be precisely measured to have at any point reached at least 71.1 celcius, something he didn't do.  3. The author of this video makes mistakes, as can be seen in the second half of it. It is also laughably enough, your only source of these self-proclaimed ""facts"" you're spewing out which is a contradiction.  Again. Excellent job kicking your own teeth in for me. Now kindly get the fuck off the internet until you grow some pubes, kid.",7년 전,0,

@ijustwanttocomment21,"Coecoo Coecoo ground beef is only recommended to be cooked longer due to factory processing problems. The grinders at factories aren’t cleaned perfectly and there’s a certain amount of time ground beef can be left out before packaging happens. If you do what he does in the second part of this video and grind it yourself, no problem! Or if you buy your ground beef directly from a butcher, you’re also good. Salmonella is also very less likely to be found in beef. Beef cows are often treated for the bacteria prior to slaughter and beef cuts are usually tested prior to shipment. Basically, don’t worry. Don’t cook your ground beef rare, but it doesn’t have to be brown all the way through. Full cuts of beef are totally fine to be served rare to well done. Fancy beef from fancy cows can even be served blue without worry.",7년 전,5,
@Runefrag,"The concern i pointed out was not for the second part of the video. It was for the first, and as you can see from the ultra-cheap supermarket bread he's using, i don't have the greatest confidence that he's buying high-quality items and nor should you, not that it's actually worth taking the risk of undercooking meat in the first place, regardless of who you are.",7년 전,1,

@QualityPoptarts,"When you cook a burger at medium-rare, there is no risk of salmonellosis due to the fact that processed beef has very low traces of it, and also because a medium-rare burger is cooked all the way through. Besides that point, I don't think you've gone and watched any other of Babish's videos, with you saying he doesn't buy high quality items. The guy uses locally sourced markets for his meats-- from a butcher, to be precise, as stated in many of his videos that are over recipes with meat in them. In this specific video, it's likely that he wanted to show that you can make a good burger even from cheap items, and I say that because immediately after, in the second half of the video, he uses higher quality items, and better processes to prepare the burger. The fact that you even admit to negating that is astounding. Quit slinging hate to someone who clearly knows more about cooking than you do.",7년 전,2,
@QualityPoptarts,"And a second thing-- the whole thought of ""that burger is pink that means it's raw"" is a misconception... one that you obviously believe. When a burger or even a steak reaches the consistency of medium-rare, it is fully cooked, and, just because it has a pink color, by no way means that the burger is raw. I don't know who taught you otherwise, but they taught you wrong. The only time a burger is raw is when it is raw.",7년 전,4,

There is no such thing as an MSG allergy, no such thing as ""MSG sensitivity"", and no such thing as an ""MSG headache"". If you get a headache after consuming food high in MSG you're actually suffering from dehydration. MSG is a salt and, like standard table salt, if you eat too much without drinking an adequate amount of water, you will feel the effects of mild dehydration. No proper scientific study into MSG has ever discovered any negative effects inherent to the ingredient itself. The entire idea began with one quack decades ago who basically made the whole thing up, published his fake findings and was later disgraced for pulling the same thing several other times. Sadly, lots of people bought into it before then and the myth has continued to spread ever since.

@MissingmyBabbu,"If I had to guess, the meat in the patty would be anchovy or sardine or maybe even manatee (sea-cows). And the most likely MSG is kombu. I know the big theory is that it's crab, since Mr.Krabs and his mother are the only crabs we ever see, but we also don't see any starfish or sponges outside SpongeBob and Patrick, most likely reason being making distinct main characters (since outside of them, everyone is a generic ""fish"" of some kind). Mr.Krabs might be breaking a load of labour laws, but I doubt he's a cannibal. I mean, think of the expense of getting the meat from a discreet source, for one. You think he'd pay that if he had cheaper options? And murder is a hard crime to hide.

The average person is better off with well done in their own house or going to an average restaurant; while a chef or going to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant allows for more trust in doing it a preferred way.  For me, idc what chefs say, I want my stuff well done AND juicy, because I prefer it that way. Close minded chefs may be saddened by the thought, but I don’t like the ‘raw’ flavor, I like the cooked flavor and especially a crispy crust of carbon goodness be it on a stove or grill, hamburger or steak.  So his comment of overlooked on that burger? No, about right though I could go for more sear on the outside ...  think butter burgers from Culver’s or similar; to be clear, not talking about an over cooked patty from a chain that has also been in a warmer too long where it is neither seared crust nor juicy, just a hunk of bland meat (those chains burgers can be good if procedures are followed properly and it’s fresh).  To each their own, dated someone who loved medium rare and a friend when I was younger liked it red in the middle and pretty much bleeding lol I can respect that, as long as you don’t serve it to me!

And the other reason why there wouldn't be Lobster meat in our patty of deliciousness leads us to our next piece of evidence, the fact that the secret ingredient is in the name, ""Krabby Patty"". Now I know that despite the name being Krabby, and not Crabby, that is only because you know. ""Mr. Krabs"" makes it better as Krabby and not Crabby. Also, an example that proves the fact that it's in the name would be because other menu items have the main ingredient in them as well. Example: Kelp shake. That is my conclusion.",7년 전,0,

Heck, bonito flake and kombu make sense - considering what bonito flake is (dried fish shavings) it wouldn't be unusual to see that in the Bikini Bottom dump (whose population is mostly fish), and it's totally believable that he'd just scrounge up some kelp and use it in his burger considering how poor he was at the time of the episode (not to mention kelp is actual food in the series - remember that Spongebob's cereal of choice is KELP! cereal).",8년 전(수정됨),0,

If you're going to claim that you made a certain recipe you have to use the ingredients in said recipe . this hamburger does not meet those requirements.,7년 전,1,
@crowgang6678,wait - trolling right?...              right?,7년 전,5,
@stephenaddams6670,I'm not trolling. I am simply saying the Secret formula in the tv show (the one he is falsely clamming to have made) has tumeric in it among other ignored ingredients and secret suace . His hamburger does not. And he could have done better trying to recreate this fictional recipe. if the title of this video had been A Really Taste Hamburger. I would have no criticism. I think he should strive to do a better. if he's going to claim to recreate fictional dishes than it should be as close as humanly possible to the original even if it is a cartoon. This isn't a trophy for showing up type situation it's either a krabby Patty or it's not. He made a great hamburger just not a krabby Patty. Do you get it???,7년 전,1,

@stephenaddams6670,this recipe is incorrect. he made an awesome hamburg. i actually want to make the burger in this video. it's just not a good representation of the krabby patty. i am very sorry if my observation  upset you. i just do not like being miss led.,7년 전,1,

@stephenaddams6670,as i said i never shut up  and i addressed your amazing explanation my hopes for this video where only that it be true to the show and i was let down  im very sorry that my disappointment offends you so greatly  i just do not like that it clams to be a krabby patty because its incorrect  the problem is that its wrong not that i pointed it out  and i did make food tonight and i didnt clam it was something it wasnt because i have integrity i dont know the full recipe and i dont clam and it ok not to know but this guy dues not know and clams he dues thats not ok  its not a krabby patty,7년 전,1,
@stephenaddams6670,And the fact that you had to stoop down to calling me names mean that you have drifted from a logical argument to an emotional one. This recipe is not the krabby Patty. It says it is but it's not. Your position is... That this recipe is 100% correct? Or that if you put me down it will be correct?

(it's almost like those errors were intentional). the comment that I was responding to complained about my sentence structuring so I threw out spelling and punctuation as well. Because no matter how many arbitrary flaws you can find with me my point is still accurate this recipe is incorrect and no amount of the insulting me or attacking my personality or my tenuous grasp on the English language is going to change that.

Secondly it seems like you are trying to control what I say by insulting me. All I said was this is not an accurate representation of the Krabby Patty because it doesn't have turmeric sea salt land salt it's Krabby Patty inspired it's Krabby Patty adjacent it's Krabby Patty similar. it's not the Krabby Patty, and he definitely didn't figure out the secret formula. no matter how much you insulting me it's not going to make this recipe accurate. you're having a very emotional response and I am sorry that my observations invoke that in you I am being very civil with you. I hope that you can find it in side of yourself one day to be civil with people that disagree with you or that say things that you don't agree with. jumping straight to insulting someone's intelligence because you don't like eloquently pointed out inaccuracies in the world is in my opinion ignorant but I have no reason to accuse you ignorance nor do I have the desire to insult you I just want people to try their best and not miss label things. again I'm not asking for Perfection just honesty...

@stephenaddams6670,"Alligator Mememan it's all good. I just really got my hopes up when I saw this because I've watched so many SpongeBob episodes and then it was missing some of the things that I new was an ingredient tumeric. And I really do enjoy this recipe it's a very fine hamburger recipe there's no doubt about that and I'm not disputing that, at all. my only problem was that it's not accurate to the show because it's missing tumeric. I watch the other videos this nice fellow made and all of them were top-notch especially the Bob's Burgers one. in my opinion this video fell short because of turmeric. and when I stated that everyone flipped out on me like I had insulted their mother . So again I'm not trying to offend anyone this is recipes just missing turmeric. it's wonderful hamburger, but it's not a krabby patty.",7년 전,0,

That means, they come from farms and butcher shops that work with meat that comes from stock, raised in the correct environment, fed on grass and pretty much anything that's not being locked in a cage and force-fed with hormones and shit.

I feel like it would be more seafood based since they live in the sea (crab meat/fish idk just a guess)  4. they use normal plain old tomatoes  5. that's just me because I've watched it for years and I feel like it could be possible to make more of a realistic original kind like the one on t.v.

I make stuff out of metal for a living, I'm a blacksmith, and to me that's the best job in the world. All the time growing up I'd get in trouble for ruining my Mum's knives on the stove because I liked to see them glow red, and my parent's would constantly lecture me to make sure I'm not an arsonist, as I'd take any opportunity I could to start a fire. Now I'm all grown up and shit I get to play around with fire and I get payed to make metal glow red (the hitting it part is just a chore I've got to do, but either way it's still fun as fuck to see the final product). I'm a bit jealous that I don't get to eat what I made after, but then again I don't want to work for a couple of hours on something, only for me or someone else to shit it out in an hour or two.

@sydneyedmonson9211,"James Pawson, Monosodium glutamate aka MSG isn't good for you. My mom and multiple people around the world have tolerances to it. She can't have it because it makes her heart crazy and gives her bowel problems. Other symptoms are headaches, tingling in the mouth, numbness, chest pains, and other sorts of things.  I can't have it either (headaches/migraines) , a few people I know can't have it because it does it does similar things to their bodies. My mother has done multiple researches as well and can prove it's not healthy for you. It is extracted from seaweed, which she can have because it is naturally occurring in it. The reason she can't have it in other things is because it's taken from the seaweed, which was not how it was supposed to be. It is in table salt to keep it ""fresh"". We started using Himalayan salt (pink salt), it tastes the same and doesn't give us problems. You probably don't have a problem with it because you've built up a tolerance like millions of other people around the world. It's actually banned in other countries, I'm pretty positive. Other names people use are Yeast Extract, Carrageenan, Gelatin, anything ""flavors or flavoring"" like Natural Flavors, etc. If you don't believe me, you can look it up. You honestly don't need it in your food. A woman in the 1960s introduced it to the USA. She realized that it was a mistake as soon as she did it. Some Asians probably can't have it either. So there. This is coming from a fifteen year old and a 46 year old who have done their research.",8년 전,4,

@emirinobambino,"FINALLY! Thanks man (: But I have a problem with your arrangement of textures. Due to the fact that a burger is contained by two soft pieces of bread, the transition between soft to crisp to soft is the key to a great burger texture.  This means structuring it in anyway as you see fit, so long as soft ingredients, like tomato is touching the bun.  I hope you give this a try and fix this, quite frankly, egregious mistake.",8년 전(수정됨),0,

The SpongeBob episode Friend or Foe showed a whole bunch of herbs and spices fall into a vat of meat, giving it the irresistible taste that made it a famous sandwich. Whatever makes up the patty itself, THAT has got to be the recipe, because replace the patty with any other meat patty, and it's just another cheeseburger with works, nothing that special.",5년 전,1,

@umiluv,"aywancfc - ground beef in stores can be made up of all kinds of gross bits from the cow (skin, innards) which can typically harbor bacteria.  The items you get at the supermarket are shipped to the market already prepackaged.  The only way to be sure you're eating ground beef that is 100% muscle meat is by grinding it yourself or asking your butcher to grind the specific cuts of meat for you.",8년 전(수정됨),4,
@onooooooooooo,maybe in the 1940s,8년 전,5,
@mermaidatlantica,The reason is because minced beef offers bacteria ample ground to form. With steaks you sear the outside and the inside remains untouched by bacteria so you can afford a pink centre. With mince you have too much surface area exposed. You have to cook it all the way through to make sure the bacteria is killed. Unless you mince it yourself and cook it immediately.,8년 전,2,
@hotsauce2768,"Nathan Neitzke no, on the outside of the beef is where bacteria is, and in ground beef that outside layer is mixed in through the entire patty so you have to cook it properly inorder to kill all of it. Now I'm sure he has a food thermometer but if anybody w/ one sees this and wants to cook their burgers that way.. their health is in the line",8년 전,2,
@yt-jf8we,"Every day millions of people eat ground beef that wasn't cooked to well done.  I just did so today at lunch and last night for dinner.  You're right that there have been cases of contaminated beef in the past such as the infamous 1993 Jack in the Box E. coli outbreak which killed 4 children.  A lot has changed since then though.  Regardless, I was enthusiastic when I saw Babish using my food processor to ""mince"" his own beef and I can't wait to buy some cuts of beef and do the same at home.",8년 전,1,

So to say that it is ""perfectly safe"", is just not true.  Do some research yourselves. Look at both sides of the equation fairly. Then come to a conclusion.

@soldierbug0,"Here's the thing. You said a ""espresso is coffee."" Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a Barista who studies Coffee, I am telling you, specifically, in Coffee, no one calls espresso ""coffee."" If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying ""coffee family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of potio aquam arabica, which includes things from French Press to Drip Coffee. So your reasoning for calling Espresso Coffee is because random people call ""Espresso"" ""Coffee""? Let's get Frappes and Instant Coffee in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. Espresso is espresso and a member of the coffee family. But that's not what you said. You said Espresso is Coffee, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the Coffee family Coffee, which means you'd call Frappés and Coffee-flavored syrup ""Coffee"" too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?",8년 전,0,

@unknownmysterious-man1861,"Another appeal to authority argument. The charts in that same study PROVE that the experimental group during the experiment experienced headaches, nausea, and fatigue among other illnesses even when compared with the control group. Here's a synopsis of a book by Russell Blaylock, M.D. that explains about the danger of excitotoxins such as MSG:  http://americannutritionassociation.org/newsletter/review-excitotoxins-taste-kills  From this article:  ""First, in the brain, the correct balance is maintained by excellent processes for reducing excess glutamate (or glutamic acid) at the special glutamate receptors in many neurons. Some processes involve storing the extra glutamate in nearby glia cells. Activating the appropriate enzymes for this process requires a great deal of energy, which, if unavailable, will result in the continual exposure of the neurons to the excitatory glutamate, injuring them and finally, if the energy deficit persists, the neurons will die. Other protective processes involve sufficient magnesium to block the uptake of glutamate by the neurons and also sufficient antioxidants, such as glutathione, Nizagara 100 tablets and vitamins C and E, to dispose of the free radicals generated within [sic] the neurons by the excitotoxins such as glutamate, aspartate, and cysteine. The powerful antioxidant glutathione consists of two of these excitotoxins, cysteine, and glutamic acid, plus glycine. However, glutathione can only be formed from these amino acids when magnesium, potassium, and sufficient energy are all present.""  ""Not only have many experiments shown that excitotoxins (such as MSG) in the diet cause major endocrine problems but also an experiment giving MSG to pregnant mice has shown similar injuries in the offspring, confirming that glutamate passes across the barrier of the placenta and enters the fetal bloodstream.  Consistently, the animals exposed to MSG were found to be short, grossly obese, and had difficulty with sexual reproduction. One can only wonder if a large number of people having difficulty with obesity in the United States is related to early exposure to food additive excitotoxins since this obesity is one of the most consistent features of the syndrome [MSG exposure]. One characteristic of the obesity induced by excitotoxins is that [it] doesn't appear to depend on food intake. This could explain why some people cannot diet away their obesity. It is ironic that so many people drink soft drinks sweetened with NutraSweet® when aspartate [in it] can produce the exact same lesions as glutamate, resulting in gross obesity The actual extent of MSG-induced obesity in the human population is unknown. . . . [However], humans develop higher levels of blood glutamate following ingestion of MSG than any other species of animal known.  Pregnant mothers are seldom warned about dangers to the fetus from excitotoxins. Due to the pioneering work of John Olney, MD, pure MSG has been removed from baby food. However, the food manufacturers continue to add an ""even more dangerous product, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, which contains three known excitotoxins and has added MSG.""  In regard to the intact blood-brain barrier, there are many conditions during which it ""can be temporarily broken down, such as with heat stroke, brain trauma, encephalitis, strokes, hypertension, and even severe hypoglycemia."" Also, in the aged, the blood-brain barrier has often deteriorated. For example, small strokes that we may not even be aware of can leave ""a point of seepage for glutamate and other excitotoxins to by-pass the blood-brain barrier. In this way normally excluded excitotoxins from food can endanger the brain."" The excitotoxins glutamate and aspartate are relatively small and can pass through an injured barrier when larger molecules are still excluded.""  ""For example, in Guam following World War II the natives developed exceedingly high levels of ALS and some of them later developed Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. The cause was in their diet of flour made from the seed of the false sago palm (cycad), which has poisonous constituents. They had eaten this flour for centuries but only after ""soaking the sliced seeds in water for several hours. This was repeated several times, each time using fresh water. After the last soaking, a chicken was fed some of the wash water. If it lived, the seed was deemed safe to eat."" However, because of famine during the war, cycad flour became a much larger part of their diet. Also, fresh water was scarce so the precautionary measures were often abandoned or at least abbreviated. Adding to the problem, the famine could result in the natives having chronically low blood sugar. As explained above, low energy levels can block the detoxification of neurotoxins. Thus the people would be more vulnerable to the devastating neurodegenerative diseases.  Natives of Guam who immigrated to the United States and were no longer exposed to any of the cycad flour still developed the neurodegenerative diseases years later at ten to fifteen times the American rate. Since these diseases develop very slowly, Dr. Blaylock speculates that the people from Guam were exposed here to the less potent neurotoxins glutamate (from MSG) and aspartate (from NutraSweet®), which finally resulted in sufficient additional neurons dying so that they developed the neurodegenerative diseases that had devastated the natives of Guam at even higher rates.""  I'll have to look for the actual experiments Dr. Blaylock is referring to, but you get the idea.",8년 전(수정됨),0,

I am trained in polite discussions and I'm the top mediator in the entire neighborhood. You are worth more to me than just another target. I hope we will come to have a friendship never before seen on this Earth. Don't you think you might be hurting someone's feelings saying that over the internet? Think about it, my friend. As we speak I am contacting my good friends across the USA and your P.O. box is being traced right now so you better prepare for the greeting cards, friend. The greeting cards that help you with your hate. You should look forward to it, friend. I can be anywhere, anytime for you, and I can calm you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my chess set. Not only am I extensively trained in conflict resolution, but I have access to the entire group of my friends and I will use them to their full extent to start our new friendship. If only you could have known what kindness and love your little comment was about to bring you, maybe you would have reached out sooner. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now we get to start a new friendship, you unique person. I will give you gifts and you might have a hard time keeping up. You're finally living, friend.",8년 전,4,
