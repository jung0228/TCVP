@ThoughtLineQuotes,"It's not my place to give you life lessons, but I want to share some of my experiences with you. You can never buy love with money. Normally, I'm more handsome than most guys, and I realized that most girls don't care about looks or character. I became wealthy and got a nice car, but the girls I met loved my car, not me. I found a beautiful girl, but her interest in my money made her beauty irrelevant to me. I dated girls from many countries, and every one of them wanted to use me because I had money. Finally, I became poor and lost hope, but then I met a wonderful girl who didn't care about my financial status and married me. We now have a sweet daughter. So, as you can see, money doesn't make things work. I have come to understand better that God has written a destiny for everyone, and the partner destined for us will come into our lives. And Chinese girls might be beautiful, but I know many of them harbor hatred towards foreigners and have a bit of an ego, thinking of themselves as a superior race.",1년 전(수정됨),2,

China's harsh one child policy resulted in the killing of so many girls believed to be as many as three hundred million. Not enough girls in the country that could have been available for dating and marrying. We learn of and see an app that will once again, harm girls in a communist country that really doesn't value girls.

@gilnahnu," @IamMortui  the way you box people into things cause of their gender speaks enough. your mindset is absolutely harmful.

Tell me, you think majority of these ' rental girlfriend ' spenders are men with good mental health? most def not. The only reason why the woman in the video is doing this is to pay off her debt, debt isn't living on easy mode but boy is she lucky to be atleast pretty enough to do this job. "" Women are privileged and don't have to do anything other than have children and look pretty. "" is that your sole definition of a woman? Iyou make it seem like having children is so easy. People are much more than their gender. "" That's the worst women will ever have to go through while men have to go through that too and more. "" Why are you generalizing as if women live the same lives? You're doing it with men too, as if all men go to war, and as if no women go to war.

I feel like the girl in this vid is being very honest and saying what the Japanese girlfriend, or any hired girlfriend, is thinking inside but wont say out loud lmao. I feel whenever anyone talks about wanting to make money its really unappealing and cold-sounding, and I will say, she brings up money multiple times throughout the whole interview. Not a tactful, charming, or likeable thing to do, but honestly I appreciate that she's being so candid and mask-off about it. (Also it she said she has to pay off multiple debts.) You're literally paying a girl to be your girlfriend-- of course she is doing it for the money. It's a job. If she wasn't, she would date you for free LOL.  Also, I feel like the fact that there is a camera and a translator (not to mention a language barrier) present makes it more awkward and makes it feel more like an interview environment for the participants. I watched that Vice vid on being able to rent a boyfriend in Japan and it was sooo damn cringe the whole time because of the language barrier.

@elvishassassin1,"Here are my thoughts: 1. People hating on the girl are being too harsh. She's giving an interview so she's being honest. Do you think she will say these things to a real client? 2. Of course she is in it for the money, why would she do it if she wasn't getting paid? 3. She's providing a service. She sees it as a business. I don't think she's exploiting lonely men because as she said, if she didn't take the money, someone else will. You can feel sorry for the men and say they have poor social skills or whatever, but it could also be that they are busy and don't have time for a real relationship so they are willing to pay for something that feels like a relationship with no strings attached (ie. no obligations towards the 'girlfriend'). 4. Chinese people are generally reserved, but also very honest. It's just a cultural difference. Besides, there are plenty of warm and caring Chinese people. Don't judge 1.4 billion people based on one person. 5. It's obvious she's had a lot of work done on her face (at least a nosejob and eyelid surgery) so her facial expressions look a bit unnatural. I think if she hadn't had any procedures done she probably wouldn't look so 'cold' but then she may not get as much work from her business, so who knows. 6. I'm not a guy, but if I was a guy I wouldn't want to use her services. Then again, I'm not judging her for what she's doing. There are a lot of reasons why men would choose to rent a fake girlfriend rather than finding a real one (eg. lack of social skills or lack of time, or no desire for a real relationship). It could also be due to the gender imbalance in China creating a shortage of available women to date, as well as men's reluctance to date older single women due to social stigma. There are lots of reasons. Girls like her are simply taking advantage of a gap in the market, I don't think we should blame her for creating the situation. 7. I've actually thought about providing platonic companionship services for men, because I need money (have a mortgage that I need to pay off). The problem is this kind of service doesn't exist in the West where I live, because men will expect sexual services for payment. If such a 'companionship' service like those 'rent a girlfriend' apps existed where I live, I may consider it. 8. I'm not sure why there is a 'no touching' rule, I assume it's to protect the woman providing the services from unwanted male advances, but it seems a bit weird that she can't even accept a hug. I wonder if it's a rule that she made up or if it's required by those apps that she signed up with to provide the 'girlfriend' service?",3년 전(수정됨),0,

I feel like I can relate to her a bit because I know what it is like catering to many online people who want to be in a fake relationship with me and eventually your boundaries become stricter and harsher for self-protection. God knows how many dangers she has faced and creeps. Reported 100s, yeah I blocked and reported 100s of creepy, stalker type men as well. It is important to establish strong boundaries firmly in the beginning when it comes to these businesses that sell fake relationships or even cater to fetishes. Mine is totally virtual but it doesn't mean I don't get burned out having to put on a fake persona or try to put on a professional face and pulling out the best customer service attitude. However, some people especially narcissists and self-entitled people which happen to be the majority to push, ask and repeat things too far.  I'm assuming now that China has more toxic, aggressive & self-entitled people than Japan does based on her behavior. I can tell that she's not ready to be in a relationship because she believes you need to be financially stable first. From her honesty you can tell many things about her fears all the way up to her goals in that interview. Kei paid for a professional interview and a girlfriend experience strictly based on the rules of what the company allows, no strings attached and no other bonuses & it is smart she doesn't deviate from that role while being filmed.  She's a business woman and constantly on the lookout on ways to earn more money, preferably the easier to make it the better. Passive or residual income without much work is probably on the top of her list. I'm also similar. As for what her purpose beyond living a better life who knows... As for me, I want enough money to sustain living a long & healthy lifestyle.",3년 전(수정됨),58,

@narumisweety,I like how everyone is saying that this girl is on us for saying that she does it for the money but meanwhile you guys are not getting the point of her job is to literally make these people feel less lonely and she’s not doing that. Instead she is awkward and you could tell that she has a wall up and to compare China to Japan is completely different because everyone knows that Chinese people could care less about other people where is Japan cares a lot about what other people think and care about giving.   You can’t compare China which is a country that really doesn’t care about their own people to a country that actually cares about their own people like Japan.   For people saying the Japanese girl wouldn’t be doing it for the money like that’s obvious but obviously she’s doing a way better job and she’s doing her job as she’s being paid for. And I’m pretty sure of both you guys were the one paying for a woman you guys will not be sitting here paying for the Chinese girl because look how she’s acting,4년 전,0,
@narumisweety,"Ima just say this. As a sugar baby i can tell she’s terrible at her job, she doesn’t make anyone feel comfortable or feel less lonely, her job is to make a guy feel happy and to make him feel like that she is the girlfriend but no matter how many times I watch this I could just see that she’s very awkward and she just cares about the money which is probably why this wouldn’t last that long.   I’ve met plenty of women that would do 10 times better and actually do the part of acting like a girlfriend for the money just like in Japan how hosts are way more accommodating than this woman and they aren’t even being paid to be a girlfriend. it’s just sad when you can tell who’s money hungry and who’s actually doing it because they want people to feel less lonely and like what they do.   I love what I do as a sugar baby because I don’t have to sleep with anyone and I feel like I am definitely arm candy, even though I know I’m a tractive I’m not gonna sit there and act boring because that’s awkward and bad for business.",4년 전,0,

@paulmcdonald7272," @zeth479  Even there you are wrong, if someone wants company for social events and others hire a more efficient service and it is the escort or company ladies, which differs a lot from this service of ""girlfriends"" for rent, and which is very different from a service where you have intimacy and I will tell you one thing in both the girls are more pleasant both for the client and for the environment in which they work, they are more pleasant and you do not need to force a smile, even in some cases (not all of course) they are from more open minded and are not apathetic people as they are there for themselves; I still stand with my idea that this service that he showed in the video is a waste of money and time, compared to the one made in Japan where every penny is worth it.",3년 전,2,

For similar ideas, you can pretty much rent tempt actors like this across all areas, for anything you want, like pretending to be your parents for school and etc. I mean it is possible on some of the apps something more shady is going down, but given how she talk about the rules, I’m guessing this is not one of them.   The similar version of companionship renting in China would be vital boyfriend and girlfriend in which people rent people to talk to them and never actually meet them in real life, same vloggers who tried that, it seems more what people here r imaging renting boyfriend and girlfriend to be like",4년 전(수정됨),2,

@amazingp-y3j,"As a Chinese girl I think that this girl’s tactic is wholly valid and SAFER than the girlfriend rentals in Japan. From what I’ve seen in the interview, Japanese girlfriend rentals are a lot more friendly and intimate: in other words, they want to make the experience all the more immersive. While I like how it’s obviously more emotionally fulfilling to the customer, he’s only going to feel more socially isolated after the date. As for the girlfriends, they might feel more guilty afterwards. It can be dangerous when some of her customers are mentally ill: obsession, stalking... Japan is rather lax when it comes to sexual harassment, so in the end it’s only going to hurt her to be so immersive.  On the other hand, it’s obvious that the Chinese girlfriends are more impersonal and even cold, but they are still in high demand. she’s setting boundaries, first of all, and she’s still friendly enough to have a good time with the customer. Maybe American people just aren’t used to the culture, but as an ABC I can hear that she’s using a friendly tone and she’s joking with him. Just my opinion.",4년 전,1,

Is there anything wrong about being a sellout?  If so, what is wrong with it?  Does this say something about authenticity or genuine intentions?  Does it matter? If there's nothing wrong with being a sellout, then it  is good & healthy to do, right?  Maybe this just cuts the ""middle man"" of formalities in relationship & courtship.  Supposedly no ambiguity.  Straight up transactional.  Maybe ultimately this is just a more straightforward way to get to the meat & potatoes and true intentions of human relationships.  Thus maybe everyone should become a sellout.  Because being a sellout pays well.",4년 전(수정됨),1,

@DamnitMan88,"People are judging her base on her morality and ethics, which she clearly explains in this video. If you compared her to the Japanese rental girlfriend, it's a different atmosphere. I can only assume her employer does not care much about her safety and with the life and people she's experienced, her optimistic and consideration for another human being is probably completely gone. Also, unlike the Japanese counterpart, she has the ability to denied requests if she felt unsafe or disgusted - she dating older men because she accepted their request.  A good message from the Japanese rental girlfriend ""if the client is giving me more money than I have offered them, it would be wrong to accept it."". It is a good message that needs to be explained to these girls in China as exploitation is generally a wrong kind of mentality.  I do, however, do not fault her for this, as this is a culture and environmental crisis in China. Mannerism and consideration is not a priority. The Regime is to blame for the mentality of China.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

Others with a much broader set of words will be able to institute much simpler scentences.... The point of communication is to be able to convey your meaning to others correctly.... Ofcourse there is still the case of newer generations usinh simple English as tgat is what their knowledge and refrences are limited to at times and instances....

Make sure it is grammatically correct and you sound like your vocabulary is not to be contested by the average person.....

She’s offering a service with clear rules. She does that to earn a living, which is what we all do. Needing money to live is something you need, not something you automatically love to do, neither do you need to love that. So, what’s wrong with just focusing on the business? It’s none of her concern if the men are sad afterwards etc, that’s a problem of society itself, and of the men themselves. She’s just doing her job. The interviewer is extremely sexist and rude in this interview. He’s obviously trying to shame her and he seems to have a major prejudice for this topic and these kind of jobs. What’s with this „do you think you’re a good person by doing this?“, just wtf man, she’s just doing her job and people pay her for this and maybe become a bit happier, so where does this make her a bad person? „And when you earned enough money?“ what should that imply? If she’s going back to „normal“ as soon as she earned enough money?? Stop the shaming of women in this kinda business! She’s not even a sexworker but she’s criticized like hell anyways. And did he seriously try to hug her in the end? Besides the fact that she clearly stated her boundaries - Does he know nothing of Chinese culture?

@ims3312," @Pisigastew  In China, this girl would not be considered a good girl, indeed she is very straightforward, most Chinese people are very direct. So that's not an advantage. At the same time, we can see that the girl has had plastic surgery, surgical knife type, which is expensive in China. She said she owed a lot of money. Why a lot of money? A business can file for bankruptcy, a school loan has no interest, the amount is not high, the hospital won't lend to you, so it's only possible that she is desperate for money to find a private loan, or more generally she is caught in the high spending trap, using a lot of consumer loans, material desire to lose her way. In addition, she said that she would accept rewards outside of work. If you are a content producer, it doesn't matter, but you are just taking advantage of the other side's lonely heart. It is true that the other side is willing, but it is not equal to get something for nothing, and naturally will not be accepted by the mainstream Chinese values.

Why should she take the baggage? Dude, there are therapists if you're pitful. Renting a girlfriend is not the right choice on the clients' path. Also, if people didn't like her she wouldn't be one of the top ones and nor would she be offered that many people. Looks like not everyone needs overly emotionally exaggerating people in China.   Bottom line: Don't compare your personal needs from a girlfriend to that of her clients needs and wants.  She not a therapist. Also, it's her body. She can protect her body if she wants to from her clients. That's not what she offers. So she doesn't take extra money for those stuffs. However, if people do give her extra money out of their personal wish, she accepts it.

@smileymosh,"Unpopular opinion here but I don't think this girl should be antagonised completely, I just think she was more practical and honest in terms of what her goals are for her when she is entering into this field of work. I think another important factor to also understand is the Chinese culture - usually it is common for men to show their affection by spending money on their partner. In fact, some guys would even see it as a rejection of their affection if a girl happens to reject their offer to pay for their things, etc. I think women from China are quite  'practical' in the sense that if they're being offered money, they will take it and men are therefore accustomed to winning affections like that. It's not as if they are forcing them to pay X amount. I don't think as well, the man will expect something from the women even after they offered their money. Although I don't agree with the idea that men should be expected to pay up to thousands of dollars for a partner, you also got to expect that your money WILL be taken if you offer it because some people are just like that. Simple. If the men wanted to offer the money (which is not required) and then expect the women to comply with how she behaves which will make him happy, then that's just narcissism. Also, I think a lot of people is expecting her to have some sort of passion or 'care' about this line of work. Some people do - and that's good for them! Unfortunately, she doesn't, and that's valid. If she really wanted to be a good person and nice, you don't have to do that for money. You can do it for free. You can simply be compassionate to anyone you see on the street. Obviously, this women isn't here to do that. She's here to receive money and that's her goal. You can't shame her for entering into this business and then trying to fake and sugar coat this service for the sake of the interviewer. If you wanted her to act and perform for this video, then you might as well write up a script for her to talk about! Again, I'm not trying to incite any sort of heated argument here, but this is just my opinion. I also don't personally like it when women are too materialistic - but hey, that's just how some people work and we got to respect that. Not everyone has to comply to our expectations of how they should or shouldn't behave. We can only just choose to stay in a relationship or walk away. In this case, if the guy that rented this girl didn't like her during the date, then why would they offer money at the end of it? They're to blame for their own actions too.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

Treat it as any job, it's not like any of us would actually deny that we are there for the money and only the money. Like any job, it's the same thing, she's just there to earn money.

@williammunny9916,"Revelation 13.13 He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men. 14 And he deceives those who dwell on the earth by those signs which he was granted to do in the sight of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword and lived. 15 He was granted power to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed. 16 He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, 17 and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. 18 Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666. .Jesus Christ loves you.  Only Jesus Christ saves.  Repent and be saved.  Tomorrow could be too late.  God bless you, and peace be upon you and your family in the name of Jesus Christ..",4년 전,0,

@bobbiepins812,"To me, this is simply a mismatch of the job and her personality.  The Chinese girlfriend is detached, brutally honest, and objective. She knows what she wants (money), and knows how to take advantage of her asset (her looks) to get it. She is confident in expressing her views no matter how people will feel about them.   On the other hand, the Japanese girlfriend did a better job as a rental girlfriend because she displayed the attributes necessary in typical customer service occupations -- huge amount of emotional sensitivity, warmth, compassion, and willingness to cater to the other person's needs.  I think the Chinese girlfriend will do well and be more engaged in career pursuits that do not involve empathizing with and taking care of people, such as being an operations manager or business owner; thus allowing her to solely focus on results, and of course, money.",5년 전,3,

But I guess its a plus side to be so logical and blunt sometimes especially in an interview XD",5년 전,0,

There are some men who would have that disgusting motive because they don't know how to control their behavior due to their loneliness or family issue which cause them to do such an act but I know what she's referring to but there are also men who refuse to do such acts(period). And she's the kind of GF either have an actual bf/gf or not but I think she is a lesbian but i don't care if she is or not nor judgmental towards them because I have good friends who are lesbian or Gay and I love hanging our with them even though I don't support same-sex relationship because respect ends all criticism and we respect each other because were friends duhh. And why I said all this, because I bet in real life if she WERE in an actual relationship she would just use him or her for money mostly in the end and very demanding like if you did this and not how I wanted you to do, she'll break up with you just like that. She is not a good person in general but hey, I could be wrong. As she said it her self ""What do I care."" But it's not like I wish karma at all. She did say ""Men in China"" so probably its their culture so who knows. I prefer a girl to be more compassionate IRL rather than demanding like her think single minded of others who are very annoying. I dump girls like her IRL.

In 2016 the Chinese National bureau of statistics showed that the gap was very large compared to other countries. Correct! But actual figures are more like ~48.78% female and 51.22% men (which still means like ~*33.5 million* left-over men!). - To compare, globally there are about 49.55% females.

@edt6488," @d1zguy864  Because they are better looking is the simple answer. Not really news, but that is how it's always been. However, it doesn't address the issue for the guys that can't get a date. It reminds me of Tinder where it's the unsuccessful people that pay and make it possible for the successful people on the app to hook-up. But there's no amount of masturbating that will ever solve this biological urge in men, hence it can be monetized. You only have to peruse on some of these live cam sites and see how easily most girls can make money, exploiting this.  As to why she is being so ""disinterested"", she is simply not attracted to the guy. I'm sure with the right guy she would be more fun, but again not anything new here. Is it a stretch for her to say she has many guys that want her to be their girlfriend? I wonder how much it inflates her ego?",5년 전,2,

It has ingrained to us that money is exteremely important and one should not going about wasting it and should find ways to earn even more. I dun think there is any god from other cultures that have the literal personification of capitalism and money other than us. That is saying sth about how we view money.",5년 전,0,

@TheOne-wl1yo," @toddchristensen7933  its just her, not a representation, but yes there are many others like her of course.   but i would say this, there are many men in china than women, so women have high standart i would say, for a man to get a woman require much effort in china, having a good  job, car, house is almost like a rule for a man so he can have a woman(wife). i think thats the reason why most men are single  one they want a woman but they dont have what is required  two they gave up and give peace to themselves or they dont just want to deal with that struggle.  so as a conclusion to see how that woman behave, you can see that she has that high standart, for her it is just a job. nothing bad about it i think personnally. because if women were many than men, men would behave like that too not requiring the same as women but something like ""you belong in the kitchen if you know what i mean"".  society is something really something that amaze me.",5년 전(수정됨),116,

My mind screams as though it is 'weird', and 'anti-natural' at many levels -- perhaps  I need to deconstruct why I think it is weird, it feels something essential is DEAD.  Perhaps this kind of RR is an 'emerging behavior' that is likely in  countries where women-count is lesser, where 'new industrialization happens'. Looks like these count/industrialization seem to incentivize 'gender-monitization'.    This looks like pure 'gender monitization'  -- in a level it is sad for men and women in such societies.  -- I'm not making a moral judgement, I'm just commenting on what I feel when I see this.   It raises more question about myself : Is my mind looking for some 'love/attachment' in this relationship to make it 'normal' ? Is such expectation 'normal'? What/who encoded or induced such rule?

@BIOSHOCKFOXX,"When I learned about this possibility of renting a GF or BF in Asia, I started to think how this renting is not in any way fulfilling the advertised promise, or the reason of this business.  I am not sure how those people, who rent these sorts of people, think. How they perceive it.  I see it as a pointless thing, especially for men, because what's the point here, to not feel lonely? It does the opposite, it shows you how desperate your are, how much you want to know how it is to have a GF/BF, but at the end you wont feel how it actually is, because it wasn't authentic, you will realize that this girl/guy has been with many random other people done the same thing. It's a stranger, a pretty stranger and that's it, they don't care about you, just the income, because it's business.  If they cared, they already would've had a legit boyfriend or just be alone unable to find a pair, but not to earn from pretending for a limited time to be a partner that you can't even kiss, only hand holding or...feeding each other, and one of them is just sucking money off of the other out.  Personally I can't comprehend how people using these services do not have the slightest idea of how this works, how fake it is, or maybe they do, but they hope to have something out of it, something they never will gain by using these services. Personally I would feel stupid if I rented a GF that will fake for me, and will allow only hand holding at best, or hand shaking at worst. Because kissing and romance in general is not possible in that sort of business, the whole deal wont feel satisfying at the end.  Paying to play board games or something feels weird too...don't they have some groups online through which they can interact and make meetups, and play with more people together in spare time without paying anything, or maybe some small fee? Maybe because they lack that sort of community groups that they have these sort of weird services that for some reason actually work there.",5년 전(수정됨),6,

Not only that for the issue in regards with it as branching out. Because as said, evil also knows about the things that are written. Good ones may accidentally kill and would be mistaken as evil, as well as evil may accidentally kill and would be mistaken as good. One of the reasons why, even with the thorns that are already given, no one can ever use it, not unless the whole world can already see who really are the ones attacking and the ones that are only defending... no one has the right to use the thorns, for it can also be used by evil. That is why you must do things with all your might, to push back with all your might those who will try or will really do harm you, as long as the mark of beast is very attractive in the eyes of the devils for them to be incharge of it and never the good ones they will give the chance.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@taetaeismylove9838,I have watched both the rental girlfriends and I came to this conclusion.  The Japanese girl wants to make people happy   This girl wants the money and is more career oriented. I know she comes off rude but all the stuffs she said was true. Nobody wants to be a rental girlfriend and to meet and escort new people every day. Of coz its money. The Japanese girl was passionate towards her work and it's her personal choice that she wanted to care for people. Whereas this girl is taking this for an interview service thatsy she is acting less like a girlfriend. She is straightforward maybe thats how her character is. Maybe their company suggested having different personalities. Anyways she was so true and we don't know if she is good at rental services with other clients cuz this was just an interview and we never got to see her acting like one. She doesn't really care about the lonely people because after the service ends she is a nobody to care about them. She was just doing her work.,6년 전,0,

I can not get warm with such girls. It is simply said, a total waste of time. The fact that her face looks a bit alike to Yuna (a character from FF), does not help much further. The commercialization of ""dating"" is not due to make people falling in love to each other.  I understand some people though. Many many singles in the cities.  Going Kyabakura instead is a different thing though. And pretty expensive in the most cases, the longer your stay is.

That girl may seem cold/rude to many, but that may just be the Chinese culture and that the Chinese men see nothing odd about it.   That said, even though she was very pretty (subjective), if that was a real first date, I would have ended the date early and dumped her--in a polite way, of course.",6년 전,0,

@andraxxusnephilem9423,"Anyone believing these girls would feel like a friend let alone a real girlfriend are morons.. But I think this ""girlfriend"" rental service would make great opportunity for foreigners to practice their cultural interactions.. Even for girls. Rent one as a glorified tour guide. Make her show you around, learn the culture from a native. If you screw up (badly) and offend or anger her, she can go the ** away with her money and you can rent another ""girlfriend"" next hour.. Its just business..  Not that I did anything like this, but I would maybe.. These Asian countries have gazillion different customs and practices.. I would love to visit Japan, but I really fear saying/doing something bad and unknowingly hurting somebody (down to waiters in cafe). This is almost a deterrant for me to visit there. This hour-long roleplaying game would be very helpful.",5년 전,0,
@CeCe1066,"Saqib Farooq Ngl in the beginning she did seem really indifferent and bored. But all these comments are waay too dramatic. It was awkward in the beginning because it was probably the first time she was being interviewed in such a way, and jeez the guy was using park exercise equipment for gods’ sake!!! The second hand embarrassment jumped out lol. But when they just sat down and talked more, you could really see her personality shine. She had a sweet smile, and a very realistic outlook on this career choice. It’s just a part time job for her, and of course she’s not going to be attached to any of her clients. It’s dangerous and useless. Ya’ll can’t deny that you’d only be focused on the money too. She’s not causing anyone harm, and if she gets $1k in tips she has to be doing a great job and dare I say maybe making some of the clients happy.

Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666. .Jesus Christ loves you.  Only Jesus Christ saves.  Repent and be saved.

Those who are in the best conditions/making the most money. In fact, like she said. As long as she's not harming anyone, its considered 'good' in China. You can tell how low their bottom line is from that statement because most of the time, people are actually harming each other over there in one way or another to make a living or get an advantage. Scandals/Fooling people to make money, all kinds of tricky things are done there. Its not a great place to be born at.

@ThomasYYang,"As a Chinese guy lived in China near Shanghai for over 20 years and now have spent over 10 years in US, I want to provide my two cents of comment.  I saw a typical victim girl under Capitalism China in modern days. Income discrepancy is extreme in Shanghai. When a normal person is desperate in buying an apt there with her 30 years wage, she becomes cold and indifferent. Being Jealous of those rich guys in the city as well as those ""successful"" girls who could trade for fortune by accompanying rich guys for either marriage or long-term relationship (a lot of times affairs), in addition to seeing typical Chinese rich guys' indifferent/arrogant/domineering/toxic behaviors as the give back to the society, makes many girls from a low or middle class, as cold hearted as Zhou.   In my opinion, American girls who date with sugar daddy are probably much more humane, real and down-to-earth than the girl here. At least, wanting money for finishing a B.S. degree then start to live on themselves independently sounds a lot more rational than making endless more money for Zhou's elusory security feeling. She will never earn that amount of money satisfying her security level in her mind, she will only get old and eventually not suitable for such a renting job. So better be realistic and live on herself by doing some normal jobs.",6년 전,0,

I don't mean to sound Ethnocentric, but it seems like it's very common for people in China to have really messed-up misunderstandings about basic human sentiments, love and relationships.  I was there for several months and lived in several different cities in the mainland, and whenever conversations of this nature would come up, there seemed to either be a lot of immature naivety or rather cold/indifferent sentiment about these issues.  I encountered very few (younger) people who seemed to really have a somewhat healthy and conscious understanding of love/sex/relationships and so on... so many people just seemed so self-centered about it, which was strange because China is a VERY other-oriented, culture... I learned a lot from China about understanding the impact of doing what's best for the group and not just seeking your own self-interest.  As far as cultural-norms goes, I feel like Americans (we, who tend to be the more self-entitled and self-oriented types as a culture) could actually learn a lot from Chinese culture when it comes to being community minded.  I sometimes wonder if the impact of Western culture has lead to a lot of this newer, more self-entitled way of approaching relationships.       I get that the culture is different and all and I'm not intentionally judging an entire people group, but I feel like this is something that is finally starting to change or improve in Asia in general, China in particular.",6년 전,0,

Thailand seems like a better deal.,6년 전,0,

Basically 80% of girls will be with you because of your wallet and will never love you truly but make you think she loves you. From my experience with more than 15 chinese girls from different part of China, one of them i even almost married but left me because found richer guy lol.. Debts are real problem now in China. I will give an example , one of my ex who left me for a richer guy was abandoned by him because he could affort better girls (haha), immediatly after my ex finished university and found a job she took a credit 400k$ to buy an appartment. 1 year later she lost her job and cant give back credit. This situation is so common thats why there are some weird services. Chinese are consuming society who want to show off their brands LV Gucci Apple YSL Chanel but they live shitty life as a sacrifice for public appearance. They do not have sense of saving money but they are pushed to spend as much money as they can to boost Chinese economy. But one day it will come to an end, there is already housing buble  happen.

We bought two tickets for the boat from Samui to Krabi. 700 baht per piece. At noon on January 25, 2019, the minibus took us to the dock on time, took a boat to Surat Thani, and then took a tour bus to Krabi. The bus traveled to the middle of nowhere and the tour bus driver asked us, more than a dozen people, to get off,  after that, the bus went away and left us in a small shop to rest. The owner of the store began to lobby everyone to eat, consume, and promote Krabi City Taxi fare, the fare is 250 per person. For those who have a consumption, they will immediately take us to the local bus stop to go to Krabi instead of hiway bus. If one do not consume, they will not send the guests to the bus station. It took us seven hours to get to Krabi, and we spent a total of eleven hours on the trip. It was exhausting. Please be careful, make sure your hotel get you a more reliable travel agent.

Similarly, you pay a doctor for a visit but you cant expect the doctor to approach you regularly giving you calls to check up on your health.

@deusexbaby5555,I dont see anything wrong with this because at least shes advertising herself that she is doing this for money unlike girlfriends that lie to you and make you think it is a real relationship so you pour gifts to her until she finds a richer guy. BTW renting boyfriend??? Sign me up!! XD anyway if you are thinking about doing this to build confidence it isnt recommended. The hard part is confronting them in the first place. Either because they have lots of friends around them or because you just cant find the right time to speak to them. After that it is easy. In my experience as I was very shy myself of girls. I still am but not as bad as before. It seemed very easy to me after i finally got to talk to a girl i liked. But you have to genuinely want a good relationship not just use her for your sexual pleasures.,6년 전(수정됨),0,

Also tons of the Chinese young people like her do not have brothers and sisters, which means a young couple has to take care of 4 old guys given their parents are still alive. They have to do this partially because the last generation was not living in a prospering China and they usually spent most of their life savings for the education of their kids.

I do believe that comforting environment that I feel in my homeland does exist in China too. But you know, people (if not media) more interested in negativity talks.  Interestingly, my friend went there, live for a while, and said to be Chinese in mainland china (especially in the city) tends to act....negative. Like said ignorance, rude and materialistic. Again, he said it was due to rough environtment in big cities. Somehow the balance between rich and poor is kinda off in china, even after my friend compared to America.

@cordedhornet9739, @BendApparatus  we all came from a single cell at one point and was created into a world that was perfectly balance to withstand life even a small percentage wrong on a calculation for gravity would have pushed us away and into space or the pull would have sucked everything to the core. There are many cases like this where we live in a perfectly balance habitable world and no one knows why it exist so it does have to do with science and a being who allowed this to be possible. It maybe make belief to you but isnt science the same until you can prove it with theory? Many people dont believe in string theory or other possible theories that many scientist throw their lives at to prove or is this considered make belief too? The fact that you're already picking a side without believing in the possibility of the other to not exist when it is more likely that both science and a higher being have a strong part to do with our existance.

Like Albert einstein quoted ""science without religion is lame and religion without science is blind"" even the genius himself believed 2 of these theory may have something in common and he was no religious believer either. I wouldn't say an omni potent God created the world since I understand the complications of creating the universe and how it is perfectly balanced to sustain life if it was able to thrive even if the universe was a small percentage off creating matter nothing would exist it would just continuously explode and destruction would never end. I wouldn't say a omni potent God would be a creator but wouldn't this make sense that there is a celestial being?

@cordedhornet9739," @BendApparatus  we havent discovered anything that would prove a greater being exist or have we discovered how we came to existance with science rather then the one cell theory and a few others theory that I cant think of. What I'm trying to say is you cant just assume one thing without the other to be possible. We have reached out to space more then researching the depths of our planet probably do to the lack of resources bc of the pressure once you reach a certain point. People have guessed what is at the center  of the earth and assume theres a core but they could be wrong since we havent even dug deep enough to even confirm all the lairs and basic possibilities of our planet. There are so many things man have not achieve yet to get closer to the singularity generation and you say a higher being or other mythical possibilities are fantasy and mostly untrue when science itself is a fantasy since they come up with all these theories of floating objects, teleportation, move at extreme speed etc... they believe it exist and that's a fantasy believe it or not. One day someone can prove it and implement it to our society but that could take hundreds of years before its proven and man will not live long enough to see your beliefs come true.

@BendApparatus," @cordedhornet9739  there's a difference between fantasy and speculation based off physics we try to understand. Science is far from fantasy... I think your desire to be open minded is depreciating the science of speculation and hypothesis.  Yes I get what you're saying... anything is possible even the ""creator"" theory. This conversation has no end as it's basically a loop...  You want to believe in single cell evolution? Fine I'm with you...  You want to believe created from otherworldly science?

@cordedhornet9739," @BendApparatus  I know one thing is that fantasy can be proven it just comes in many shapes and forms and of course it's an endless loop and it will always be an endless loop since knowledge isnt something everyone can comprehend only the most prestigious minds will be challenged by it. Unfortunately I dont have that kind of knowledge but I keep an open mind bc of the fact nothing has been proven same as how knowledge of physics or science in general didnt come out of no where and no one can personally say who came up with it more of how did they come up with these realistic theories to accurately calculate events, objects etc. Theres even a limit to what science can explain or prove and there have been cases where some events happened and they still truly cant explain it even if they have samples of it to keep researching. What current knowledge we have to this day isnt everything so to solely rely on science and nothing else is the same as a religous person who only believes in religion and nothing else bc neither group can truly proven the existance back to its origin.",6년 전,0,
@cordedhornet9739, @BendApparatus  like I said before just bc you cant prove it or see it doesnt mean it's there unless proven of course XD.

Theres so much to discover before concluding to one ideal and saying your beliefs are the correct way.,6년 전,0,
@BendApparatus," @cordedhornet9739  you sure about that? Let's take that last point you made...""science can't explain why we keep surpassing our limitations""... Who placed these limitations? Oh yeah people.... People who believe in magical beings....and people of science... Both based on limited knowledge...  We evolved and we keep evolving. (No we're not gonna fly anytime soon...😋) So there's no reason physical feats would NOT be surpassed. No reason intelligence based feats would not be surpassed. No reason scientific based discoveries wouldn't be surpassed...we keep evolving in every sense of the word... adaptation surpasses known limitations...  You sound like someone who believes in God's...but was relunctantly convinced to accept science. Science is bold and confident. What was once believed to be fact is disproven and discarded for the new proven truth.  Science is not wishiwashy holding on to outdated beliefs (like magical God's) for the sake of an open mind.  Serious question... Do you believe in voodoo?",6년 전(수정됨),0,
@cordedhornet9739," @BendApparatus  if science was the only thing that's truly realistic and I'm not trying to change your beliefs nor am I a God believer either if that's what you're trying to suggest. I would like you to explain to me how physics, and other scientific calculations came to be or to be exact its (origin). Where did these calculations come from? You cant say we adapt and evolved without any scientific explanation bc if that was the case then other species should be able to acquire that knowledge and do the same but for some reason a specific species was selected to evolve and we still dont have sources on why these events happened but only theories but none proven, same as the 7 mysteries of the world like the Stonehenge, during that century what knowledge we have and what they achieved did not make sense even religion has nothing to do with it nor can we find an explanation for its existance. So compare the question I first asked you the origin of science to a higher  being as a origin and neither group could come up with an answer but it is possible to accept 2 can co-exist. My point is why cant 2 of these theories co-exist since no one have the answers or will never have the answers",6년 전,0,
@BendApparatus, @cordedhornet9739  what is there to explain? The scientific process was born from simple curiousity. Then observation. Then experimentation...including failure rinse repeat success. Even the old magic based sciences (alchemy) contributed to real science.  I never said the chance of a different creation beyond evolution from single cell couldn't exist. But not catholism not Hinduism nor paganism nor any other MAGIC based creation.  NOW that our early ancestors MISTOOK science far beyond  what we have even now for MAGIC...yeah I'll buy that.  But the fanatics believe it's magic in the fantasy sense...BS...  You never answered my question... Do you believe in Voodoo..?,6년 전,0,
@cordedhornet9739," @BendApparatus  lol no I dont believe in voodoo or i don't have much knowledge of what voodoo is but is that some kind of black magic or something? For me magic comes in many forms, illusion, entertainment, etc I get you dont believe in those religions where a being aka some dude on a power trip created this fantasy and convinced people it was realistic. Let's just say religion stained more blood then most small wars we have today. I still think religion and science have a lot of things in common like how religion can be used as a weapon and so can science they're both very destructive if used for that purpose. For me they both play a strong role but I'm glad you arnt the type of person to cuss at me if you cant convince me to completely understand your opinions met a lot people who revert to anger they're frustrated XD",6년 전,0,
@cordedhornet9739, @BendApparatus  I dont know if magic and religion should be in the same category since magic doesnt describe one specific thing.

@BendApparatus," @cordedhornet9739  yes some people become angry when their beliefs are put in question.  Voodoo is considered a religion in the Caribbean. They claim it's based on magic derived from dark God's or from dead saints.  Funny thing is... it's real... No, offering severed animal heads to dark deities or pouring blood on symbols drawn in powdered bones won't get you anything... But beneath all the showmanship... There's the real stuff they do...

Or maybe it's harder to get into a mindset of being on a date, when there is a camera person and a female language interpreter.",6년 전,1,

Not to meet people or care about them. Believe me she got a point not to care about her customers, caring too much can be anyone's doom.  Men pay her to play pretend. Men pay her to pretend to care and be the perfect girlfriend. And she does her part. So, what's the deal here? She is doing her job and the men are happy with her service. That's all that should matter. Let's be real, we live in a world where money is all that matters. Can you blame her for wanting to be paid? She is doing her job and nothing more. She is probably caring with the people that actually matter to her. But come on, will you care about a stranger that you will only be with for 4 hours that day and that you will never see ever again?  You are also being awfully racist stereotyping all Chinese women like that.",6년 전,42,
@GenyaArikado," @mafuyu8088  You have a very pessimistic view of the world.  1. The world circles around money but that's not everything. So love, care, family & friends means nothing to you? It is way more important than money dude.  2. I work in the elderly care and that means meeting different old people socializing and taking care of them. I love my work.  If this woman doesn't like her job she should be looking for other jobs.  She is only in it for the money and that's sad. She will never know true happiness in life. I'd rather be happy with an average income (like i have now) than rich and unhappy. Although that's sadly not the chinese way of thinking -> As some chinese said ""It's better to cry in an BMW, than to laugh on a bike"". 3. I have worked in other parts of town as a caregiver which means i only spend 1-3 hours with new customers. That doesn't mean i should not care about them. I promise you many have remembered me for my genuine hospitality towards them years after.  4. Chinese people are generally materialistic and greedy (only mainland) by nature so you will always come second in a relationship after his/her family. There are exceptions as always.",6년 전,0,
@mafuyu8088,"​ @GenyaArikado  I wonder if I do. 1. Yes family is MUCH more important than money I wholeheartedly agree with you! What I was trying to say is that money is still an important part of our daily lives and a need to live in this world. I cannot blame this girl for wanting to have money when it's just something we need. 2. It sounds like you have a lovely job and it's great that you enjoy it. I guess everyone is going to have a different perspective when it comes to their jobs and I feel we should respect that. You enjoy socializing and caring about the people you attend, but there will be people out there that would rather just do their part of the job and I feel that's as valid as your own point of view.  This girl actually is fine with her job as said in the interview, she pretends to be a girlfriend and they pay her. And how can't we know that she isn't happy? She fairly looked just fine to me in this whole interview, besides we don't even know anything about her life. I feel we shouldn't judge her choices. 3. You sound like a really kind caring person, I respect that and your customers must really appreciate you. But as I said above everyone is going to have their own point of view. Some will care, some will not and we should respect that. This girl is not causing any harm by simply doing her job. 4. I personally feel that's a huge stereotype, maybe some Chinese people are but not everyone will be. It's like saying Mexicans are by nature drug dealers and impolite.   Thank you for sharing your insight with me about your job! It's really nice to see different points of view.",6년 전,6,
@GenyaArikado," @mafuyu8088  1. Yes, i fully agree. We have to earn money and at the same time working is good for everybody. The hard part is balancing everything. 2. Of course socializing with other people is not for everybody as it turns out males turns out to be interested more in objects than females. Females more interested in environmental and social issues. I think a good balance there triggers happy lives in both of the genders as well. 3. Thank you. 4. You really can see the girl has become spoiled not even trying anymore. She does her job half-heartedly. As someone else said in the comment section -> she wasn't good at her work. The point is she is just cute and beautiful. And that is sadly what many chinese men (who uses these dating apps) only cares about. True beauty comes from the inside. Didn't you see the movie ""Shallow Hal"" with Jack Black? I think that movie can change some peoples thinking out there. Thanks for your views as well...as Jordan Peterson said -> you can always learn to view things from other perspectives and learn from others being openminded :)",6년 전,2,

@Mina-zw5xh," @GenyaArikado  You seem to have a very idealistic view of society which is often not always concordant with reality. The men know what they are paying for, they know it's not real, and she is just trying to earn money and they know that. As she said, she is struggling to pay off debts and I interpreted it to mean when she said along the lies of 'there can never be too much money' that she wants enough to live comfortably and as there is also an age limit on this type of work she probably wants to earn as much as she can now incase things don't work out in the future so she has money to fall back on. Also you seem to think its inherently evil to prioritise money but just because she's doing that doesn't mean she is also not happy or creating these 'deeper bonds' with her actual friends and family",6년 전,5,

They can be very smart and intelligent at work, but are also so damn stupid when hanging out with girls.  Personally I have been so disappointed in my pursuit of love. You can hardly find true love here. Both men and women are realistic. I'm so lucky that I have one good sexfriend. I don't need to pay anything except for casual dinner, movie tickets and regular presents. She pays the bills and gives me presents as well.

So if you truly want to pursue a relationship, you have to look past the skin deep and judge their values and morality, and find the individual who suits you. Even if 99% out there doesn’t work, 1% will — but you have to look for the right thing.   Not just exterior appearance, but whether they’re suited to you and what they value in life.",6년 전,0,

Way back in the day, a cowboy always took care of his horse ahead of himself. He gave it food and water,  a good rubdown, made sure its coat was dry, and put it in a warm stable with fresh straw bedding. Only after that did the cowboy clean himself up and eat dinner.  The horse always came first. There is no worse crime a cowboy can commit than putting his horse away wet with no food.  This chick has been ""rode hard, and put away wet"".

And you'll constantly be pushed outside of your comfort zone.                         This is important because now you learn how to become self sufficient and not not have to rely on a boss. By learning how to deal with people to get what you want you develop traits of a leader.  Politicians and people in power understand how to use people to get what they want. Smart people develop these skills and traits.  That's why the world shuns this kind of work because they want you working in a factory producing for Uncle Sam. Tell me I'm wrong.,7년 전(수정됨),0,

@rustynail3159,There is a booming business starting in America of single mothers looking to rent a husband for a day or night to basically do household chores and fix things that have broken. Most of the clients are in their 30s or 40s. Friend of mine works for one of these rent a husband companies and the dude makes a ton of money !. One time he had this 30 some year old single mother pay him like two hundred bucks to have sex with her after he was done fixing her sliding glass door. So he ended up getting paid like five hundred bucks to fix the damn door plus three hundred bucks to stick his weiner in her . He said company policy is that you can never give the client your phone number and that you're encouraged to park down the road so they can't read your license plate because I guess some women get a little attached and stalk you.,7년 전,0,

Only the Bible has answers to those questions, not science.  You say the Bible has no proof, then you have obviously never even studied it. The problem is not that there is no proof, but that humans don't want the proof.

It is just a myth that was created to keep world order years ago. Its already known how people were formed as a proven fact get with the times.,6년 전,0,
@PracticaProphetica," @kensims4086  I see you have avoided my main questions, and rightly so, because science cannot answer them.  So if someone came down from the sky and said ""I'm Jesus"", and did miracles that science couldn't explain, you would believe him? The Bible actually warns us that such things may happen in the future, and not to believe them, unless their teachings align with the word of God. So we, on the other hand, absolutely believe that what you see is not good enough proof, but it all must be tested by the word of God.  The reason why this is so, is that the word of God condemns all the things that men use to dominate and oppress others...so nobody would even try to use it to establish control of others, because it would teach just the opposite. That's why, if you know the word of God, you are safe from those kinds of deceptions.  Have you never heard about imposters, who pretend they are someone whom they are not? If you went only by your sight, and photos (all of which can be doctored and faked) you would surely be fooled.  The word of God is the only way you can actually test God, because if He is a God, He will not teach what men would teach. You talk about religion being ""just a myth created to keep world order years ago""...Then how could you explain that in Noah's time, almost the whole world did not follow that faith? Or in Abraham's time, when he and his family were the only one's who knew the true God? Or in the time of Moses, when God's people were slaves? If the religion of the Bible was meant to keep order, why did it have nothing to do with the order of the nations in those days? And why did it not ""keep order"" when Jesus taught it, but instead, he was put to the cross for teaching the truth?  As long as man continues being sinful, all the science in the world won't help him, it will only make him destroy himself faster, which is where we are headed right now. According to the man-flattering theory of evolution, we should be the very pinnacle, the best the universe can produce. But according to the Bible, we are frail, faulty, corrupt, deceptive, and full of every evil lust. Now we know the world is one step away from destruction at man's hand, so which picture is the more realistic one?  You really didn't expect that when men faintly discern that planets are being formed, millions of light years away, that they would see a big guy floating around in space, waving a wand? That may be your false caricature of religion, but it is not what the Bible teaches.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

Science has film pictures and proof, bible is a story and nothing in it is real or can be proven as a fact. Nothing. Nobody has proven one thing. They added plenty stories to it many times and no 2 are alike in the first place. Somebody had to create a god right? man did. period. Why you think the pope has to hide the real truth?",6년 전,0,
@PracticaProphetica," @kensims4086  I certainly won't defend the Pope or Islam...not everything that calls itself religion is truth. Jesus didn't sit on a pontifical throne, nor did he preach terrorism. ""You shall not kill"" is one of God's commandments, which men (both religious, scientific, and political) seem to agree on setting aside whenever convenient. Even Jesus was killed for ""religious"" reasons, so we have to make a difference between truth and error.  Your assertion that religion is responsible for all killing is completely biased. Communism killed millions. Atheism during the French Revolution was a blood bath. The biggest wars (World War 1 and 2) were not fought for religious reasons. The atomic bomb was not developed for religious reasons. Science provides the weapons, and men do the killing. It comes naturally to human nature, which is exactly what the Bible says about man: Matthew 15:19 - ""For out of the heart [of man] proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies.""  Exactly what kind of moral code do you draw from Science? Do you suppose that we were designed to kill, hurt and oppress others for gain or pleasure? Is this the wonderful evolutionary purpose for man, which nature designed into us? Seems like you could rightly charge nature with being a tyrant and a murderer in this case, and your anger at God could be better vented at evolution, that designed such a horrible system in the first place. At least with the Bible, we have a reason, we know God never intended it, but that sin and death were brought about by man. But with your system, why ""it's normal and natural, that's just the way it was designed."" Does that comfort you?  Now you say there is no ""proof"" that the Bible is what it claims to be. But I say you just have never really studied it. Am I wrong in this claim? You seem to be quite unaware of all the evidence. Take just one: the prophecy of Daniel 9:24-27 that predicted the exact year when Christ would be anointed, the year He would die, and the year that the gospel would go in power to the Gentiles.  70 weeks (or 490 days) were given to the Jews. But in Bible prophecy, a day counts for a year (Eze. 4:6, Numbers 14:34). So 490 years were given to the Jews from the time of the decree to restore and build Jerusalem. This decree went forth in 457 BC.  69 prophetic ""weeks"" (or 483 years) would reach to ""Messiah the Prince"" (Daniel 9:25). In the fall of 27 AD Christ was baptized, exactly according to the prophecy.  He was to ""confirm the covenant for one week"" (Daniel 9:27), and in the ""midst of the week"" to ""cause the sacrifice...to cease"", or to be ""cut off"". 3 1/2 years into His ministry, in the spring of 31 AD, Christ was put on the cross, bringing an end to the sacrificial system which was only a picture of His real sacrifice for sins.  Now there were still 3 1/2 years left in the covenant with Israel. That would reach to the fall of 34 AD. At that time, you will find if you read the book of Acts, there was an immediate change from bringing the gospel to the Jews, to the focus on the Gentiles: 1. Stephen was stoned 2. Saul was converted and became Paul, the apostle to the Gentiles. 3. Peter received a vision and was told to go to Cornelius, a Gentile and preach the gospel. 4. Philip was sent to the Ethiopian to explain Isaiah. 5. There was a persecution in Jerusalem that drove many of the Christians to Antioch.  The covenant, whereby the Jewish people would be God's chosen to represent Him before the world was over, and the call now went to the Gentiles, to as many as would come, to be gathered into Christ's body. This prophecy was fulfilled to the very time specified. There are many more of such prophecies in the Bible, some extending into events of European history. You just don't know about them, because you've never studied them.",6년 전,0,
@kensims4086,+Frank Zimmerman might of sounded good then but we know god did not create man now #1 #2 he did not create the earth these are proven facts and I stand by the facts. Long as there are 300 different Bibles people are gonna fight and argue theirs is the truth so all it did was pit everybody against each other anyway. Like I said before you have no proof you can't present any truth and nobody can either. you have to have sex to have a baby virgins don't just give birth without sex. Man created god to explain his existence years ago because they had no knowledge but we have that knowledge know no need to make up stories.,6년 전,0,
@PracticaProphetica," @kensims4086  The Bible didn't pit people against each other, people have been fighting each other since the fall, or according to your theory, for ""billions of years"". You should accept that people fight against each other, doesn't your theory call it ""survival of the fittest""? So, really it is evolution that has caused all the violence in the world, not the Bible. Again, this is according to your reasoning, and I don't see how you can escape it.  In fact, let's take this even further. Evolution made people, so evolution also made people to write the Bible. And evolution then made people fight over the Bible. So there you have it...we have the real enemy right here, exposed for all to see! :-)  The Bible goes far beyond ""explaining our existence"", it actually foretells the future. I have given you one prophetic example, there are many more, especially in the books of Daniel and the Revelation. But men do not like these predictions, because they do not flatter human wisdom and greatness. ""Those who live by the sword perish by the sword,"" and this includes all of our nations, so we don't like to hear that. This is the main reason why the Bible is disregarded...because it's core teachings are incompatible with human pride. And that is also one of the greatest evidences that it comes from God.",6년 전,0,

She IS cold a bit but i think it is crucial that she stays this way. This is not the ideal situation to involve your heart and fall, i believe.   🤔 I wonder how hard it is to chase a girl in China though. In India it is quite hard. I’ve talked to 2 girls so far (I mean to chase for myself) and it was super tough but I did it. So many situations where it ends up looking awkward Coz the girl will nevvvvver respond positively: maybe it’s the stigma of being in India. If I had to talk to them randomly to discuss or celebrate the beautiful moments in life that suddenly happen and involve her and i, it is super easy to do. Coz they sense it too. But when I’m chasing one for me, ughhhh! And it makes sense, coz there r so many a**holes and classless fellows out here messing up our game for us.   A girl’s image is super high priority to her. Just like it should be.   This renting a girlfriend in China business seems okay. No harm done to anyone.

@numeralthanks45,Aren't all incels the same while all women are different. I'm not saying that everyone in the comment are incels. Why are you defending incels anyway?,7년 전,2,
@pixp3047,"Firstly, no they're not. The fact that you chose to make just a judgemental remark clearly shows how little you understand about the subject matter. There are a billion different variables at play revolving around someone who can't find love, I shouldn't even have to state something that obvious and simple as that. Secondly, the behaviors of majority of women within the age bracket of what people are discussing here is highly similar. They may not all be same (as per the literal definition of the terminilogy), however, that doesn't mean that 95% of them don't share at least one problematic trait which is actually what people are doing, but once again, you have failed to notice that. Thirdly, I'm not defending incels per say, I'm countering your question of asking 'how?"". And finally, I hadn't defending incels until you made your post that was directed at me, however, they have every right to be defended from hateful people such as you that consider someone as an incel just because they pointed out obvious problems with women in the modern day dating circles. You clearly haven't even understood how the terminology of calling someone an incel arose. In reality, being an incel has nothing to do with lumping women into categories like you implied.  Please do learn to have some respect and educate yourself before insulting others.",7년 전(수정됨),3,
@numeralthanks45,"You're right, I agree that I have  very little and a basic understanding of what an incel is and am very ignorant and over generalize these type of people. That maybe due to the overabundant videos here in youtube that are mocking and making a meme out of them. From what I have observed, most Incels have this common trait of feeling resentment for women because they weren't acknowledging their (Incels) potential of becoming a suitable partner. As you said ""There are a billion different variables at play revolving around someone who can't find love"" Yes, this may be true in some cases, but not from the case of Incels. They lack the self-awareness of their faults of becoming a romantic interest.  You're right, Women have problematic traits, but that doesn't mean that they have the right to completely lump all women as materialistic or greedy ,as the girl in this video is clearly showing signs of,  just because they rejected you for being a ""nice guy"".  I'm not trying to be a white knight here and guard the sanctity of women's rights or whatever, I'm just giving my opinion on the topic. I apologize for accusing you of defending Incels, that was uncalled for. Incels have the right to defend themselves from hateful people like me that despise them. However, if they don't adapt to ""modern dating circles"" then should just better off being single. And thank you for hammering the thought of my ignorance of the terminology and the lore of incels in a youtube comment section.  I will try to learn some kind of respect and educate myself before insulting INCELS.",7년 전,1,

And all these guys below commenting as if they don't seek the same kind of goal LOL.  But anyways, no one can deny that it does not matter whether if a man or a women is rich. If you see a rich man, he has a flock of women behind him. If you see a rich woman, she too will have a flock of man behind her. Being materialistic does not only apply to women but man as well. Man wants more money cause they know they can attract many woman (of which are materialistic). While woman, they just want the money to have a lavish life for themselves.  What i feel is that, this woman did nothing wrong by exposing and portraying her true self to the media world. At least she is protecting herself from trash man who want more than just a friendly companion. So do you all expect news of woman being assaulted to be seen going viral? And then she will get blamed for being on such app and etc. As explained in the interview, the list of things Do's and Don'ts are listed according to individual comfortability. She had said her own criteria clearly so that nasty things won't happen to her and if it does, she could still protect herself.  All in all, i think what she is doing is very decent, morally decent too. I respect her for being so transparent about how this Rent A Girlfriend works in China and her working ethics.

""Pretend not knowing somebody"" is a way to show affection and careness in China, an intimate blaming. The girl takes this whole thing as an interview and talks honestly about how this business truly works, yet the male host keeps acting like this girl is a ridiculous figure so he has to show some ridiculous attitude to match her. In fact she is being quite reasonable and this male host made a fool of himself by being cynical. You can‘t’ expect sincere emotions if you are the one who pretends. Btw, the girl said she has an loan to pay. It does not indicate she is that kind of poor girl you guys expected.

Comparing to their neighbours when their land is in a corner or islands... china could be approached and they contact on all sides giving them a higher exposure to threats everywhere and diff cultures. japanese have relatively kept to themselves and remain unchanged or little change for generations, they choose when they want to see the outside, send some and bring back to them and simply stayed to themselves. Chinese have been known for mass migrations due to citings of tough living conditions from their homeland. they seek elsewhere to improve their living. those that stayed or being forced to stay are challenged for survival and thus very materialistic and emotionless.

In the long run, it is very effective to accumulate wealth during a countries' newborn as how capital works, and we got a lot of practices in the past 5000 years as we went through 13 or 15 dynasties depends on who you ask.

That's why here, you have many Asian families owning big houses, fancy cars because they tend to have good careers, good income etc. and can finally afford that lifestyle. That 'competitiveness' is probably their strong work ethic. I find Asians (including Indian) to be perfectionist and hard working. Hey, they're motivated by money.

Now China is forced to place extreme value in women because of the decades of not valuing them, the men are paying dearly because their parents weren't thinking. 10s of millions of men in China are never going to have a girlfriend, get married or have kids because their ancestors placed so little value in their counterparts.

@iqribellu2114,I think why physical contact isn't allowed is because then it would be considered close to prostitution and that's illegal. I have seen in Asian dramas how holding hands and hugging between a guy and girl can be a big deal you Know. Its considered more intimate there. Also if she allowed a hug then some pervert guy might go even further and try to touch her inappropriately or something. So to avoid all problems i think its better to not hug i think.,7년 전,64,

@dalysea26," @743poobpeeb  Just because you understand the language and the culture doesn't mean you know for a fact she's telling the truth.  We all understood when she said that men sometimes willingly tip her between 100,000 to 200,000 CNY (15,000 to 30,000 USD), and that's exactly why people here are reacting with skepticism.  It's natural for people to be skeptical when someone says that after shaking hands only and having dinner, that some men then give her enough money to buy a car.  Yes, that statement should be questioned.  It seems ridiculous.  I don't doubt that there are some crazy men out there.  But for you to say that anyone who questions her unbelievable statement is dumb and racist, well that makes you racist since you assume all her critics are non-asian and that not speaking Chinese means you are not asian.  Either that or you are ignorant of the fact that China is a country, not a race.  And you don't understand what it means to be skeptical when someone makes absurd claims.  Could it be true?

@chada8961," @lililuv10  Im not saying that she is entitled to. But, my opinion is you cant flatout reject any sort of physical contact when the job you do is of a  girlfriend.

@lililuv10,"@Chada but the thing is she can, also she makes it clear from the beginning before the person even rents her that she is not okay with any other forms of physical contact. Although she is supposed to act as their ""girlfriend"" that doesn't mean touching is required. Plus there are plenty of actual couples that don't like things like PDA. If she doesn't want physical contact she doesn't need to even if she is being paid, she is just supposed to be a companion for people that want it and all they need is her presence.",7년 전,0,

Basically Asian Men don't want muscles or confidence for seduction, they want money so they work hard. With money they can do anything, including seducing women. It's how the entire society and Asian mindset is. Even if you ask a little 7 years old girl what husband she will want, she will answer ""a rich one!"". So don't look down on this video. Asian men and women are all fine and healthy with this method. Western world also has ridiculous seduction rituals such as men must be strong (wtf?) and women must have nice tits (so they implant fake ones) or big butts (so they squat for ever). This won't help them have a safe and secure family. So if you really think about it. Asians got it right. And listen to her. Did you hear ? ""More money means more security"".

Also, who can blame her for wanting a lot of money in this day and age it is so easy to go into debt if you are say a college student, there is nothing wrong with her wanting to be secure financially so she doesn't have to worry about things such as when she will be able to eat next.",7년 전,5,

@techoverdose9467,"wanna learn how to make lemon cake..? well its your lucky day Ingredients: 1/2 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 1/2 cups granulated sugar, divided 4 extra-large eggs, at room temperature 1/3 cup grated lemon zest (6 to 8 large lemons) 3 cups flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon kosher salt 3/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice, divided 3/4 cup buttermilk, at room temperature 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract For the glaze: 2 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted 3 1/2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice  Instructions: Step 1: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour 2 (8 1/2 by 4 1/4 by 2 1/2-inch) loaf pans. You may also line the bottom with parchment paper, if desired. Step 2: Cream the butter and 2 cups granulated sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. With the mixer on medium speed, add the eggs, 1 at a time, and the lemon zest. Step 3: Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. In another bowl, combine 1/4 cup lemon juice, the buttermilk, and vanilla. Add the flour and buttermilk mixtures alternately to the batter, beginning and ending with the flour. Divide the batter evenly between the pans, smooth the tops, and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until a cake tester comes out clean. Step 4: Combine 1/2 cup granulated sugar with 1/2 cup lemon juice in a small saucepan and cook over low heat until the sugar dissolves. When the cakes are done, allow to cool for 10 minutes. Remove the cakes from the pans and set them on a rack set over a tray or sheet pan; spoon the lemon syrup over them. Allow the cakes to cool completely. Step 5:For the glaze, combine the confectioners' sugar and the lemon juice in a bowl, mixing with a wire whisk until smooth. Pour over the tops of the cakes and allow the glaze to drizzle down the sides.",7년 전,68,

Basically we have them because we are seen as a commodity and not individuals. A woman is something men want to own/have, not be equals with. Like a house pet if you will. Do pets have comfortable lives? Of course! They get fed, taken care of and they don't have to work. Why? Because we find them cute and they give us company and they cannot fend for themselves too well. That is exactly how women are seen by a large part of society. Do they get as much freedom, power and respect as their owners? No... My metaphor is a little extreme but what I'm saying is: most women don't want to be comfortable if it means being less respected than men.

They don't care, because they don't have to, there are hordes of men ready to give them cash and prizes for absolutely nothing AND willing to pay for the ""privilege"".  This is true in the real world as well. So, the next time you're wondering if that ""special gal"" really likes/loves you deep down, the answer is, of course not because she doesn't have to. The only difference is, it's not a straight up business deal, so she isn't going to be honest about it. I would much prefer the honesty! It's far less expensive and YOU remain in control.

Anyone can choose to do what they will so long as it causes no harm to others. However, like a double edge sword,  the act of choosing ones own moral standards has allowed for its degradation over time.  I'm not really here to argue with anyone for the sake of arguing.

@MrSatoriSan_0,"@afro symphony This question actually got me thinking a little bit more , ty for that xD. As you implicitly state ""acceptable"" is actually a relative term. Sure, what may be acceptable to you may not be acceptable to me. This is totally legitimate and was one of the points I tried to get at: people choose what is ""acceptable"" to themselves whether they adopt the conventional standard or like many people seemingly are here, more liberal and think of and do things differently.  The issue arises where the girl sells '""moment's"" to her clients on a strict basis. The implication with this however is that these ""moment's"" are generally found in courtships and monetizing them essentially devoids them of value within a relationship. Again the question is asked, how would you feel if your wife/gf offered this 'service' of whispering sweet nothings to a client during the day and coming home during the night and say the same to you? Would those words be as valuable or meaningful as they were if they were said exclusively to you?  The issue of moral/ethical degradation arises whereby, if you feel its inappropriate but she doesn't, shes causing you harm (emotionally at least) and if she feels its okay because her intentions are still pure then that would constitute an act of selfishness. If both parties find it acceptable then the requisites for relationship have just been lowered. And so, referring back to the above, people are choosing to lower passing criterias and may even find it acceptable to themselves if they are deluding others (the clients) and potentially inflicting emotional pain upon their partner and as a whole defacing the ""sanctity/essence"" of relationship.  There are core attributes to what defines a 'relationship' and no matter what age you are in it will persist, like it has throughout human history and in nature itself. This fractal of nature is intrinsic and can't be removed.",7년 전,3,
@MrSatoriSan_0,"In the clip the girl says something to the effect of 'all men only want one thing.'

@JK-zl9cq,"I'm for exclusive relationships, but honestly speaking, this is simply a different way of life, there is nothing immoral or unethical about it. As long as my sister/daughter/Mom are protected from STD, don't have children that they can't raise, are upfront about being in open relationships each of their partners, they can have as many relationships as they want, and in fact they might live better lives because there is just as much to learn from open relationships as from exclusive relationships.  You gave the example of paying my girl 50 bucks to talk to her ""cheapens"" her, I share the same sentiment but is this sentiment of ours healthy? Should we hide something that's good to ourselves and not share it with others when sharing it does not diminish it? Does her having sex with you necessarily diminish her sex with me? Is she incapable of loving multiple people, are people incapable of loving multiple children? Time and resource are definitely limited but it's not like you have to be around someone 24hrs of the day. Why do I have to be the only person that go to Mars, why can't everyone go to Mars and I just be happy about that. At the end of the day, I think it's a matter of whatever attitude that was programmed into us when we were young. As long as there is no STD and no unplanned babies, there is nothing objectively more moral, more right or wrong between the two ways of life.",7년 전,0,

@MrSatoriSan_0,"@icebalm As you suggest, I too don't believe it's the root cause of the decay. As some others have pointed out, the issues may be inherently within us. However I am making claim that the frequency in which one is presented with the opportunity to make such moral/ethical choices has increased due to the advent of the cyber-age. The convenience as offered by technological advances has made such transactions of service more available and frequent.   A similar analogy would be with regard to guns in America. If they were banned, would there still be so many gun crimes? For our discussion topic, it would equate to 'would there be such rapid decay of morals/ethics if technology didn't present and facilitate such opportunities for people to choose?' And with exceptions, most people choose the easier way out of any difficult situation.",7년 전,0,

The old rich men gave her the money willingly as they try to buy her heart, thus why not accept it as a bonus in your job? She also did mentioned that she don't ask for additional money other than the fee as stated in their contracts. In my opinion, if i was her parents, i would be very proud of her as she knows how to take care of herself and be cautious of her surroundings.

@agentice77, @razisgintingan7215  wanna hear that respond too,7년 전,0,
@feeltoofree," @razisgintingan7215  To speak frankly, I would say with just the simple words and sentences she use at the beginning of the video, you'll need less than one year even from self study. But when she starts talking a lot towards the end, that I would say 2 years of studies. Obviously when I say 2 years I don't mean spending all your time on mandarin. Personally, by the end of this year, it would make exactly 3 years I've been in China and studied language for 2 years. (2 cuz I was lazy and our school was pretty lax 9am -12pm daily with enough holidays) And with those 2 years I got HSK 4 which many get in 1 academic year or less. So to generalize, i would say you need one year of intensive studies at most to understand what she says clearly, but the environment is a key factor too cause even if you don't have chinese friends around or in your school, you still listen the language daily from random people, TV or music. Hope I could be of help.",7년 전,1,

@feeltoofree," @razisgintingan7215  wish you all the best. If your time is limited, I suggest you decide if you'd like to improve ""listening/speaking"" first or ""reading/writing"" first.

@fwcolb,"This guy looks like a lot of young Chinese guys. The girl was very stiff at first and then relaxed. She is very natural like most younger generation Chinese.  Some of the answers show she is very straight-laced, like most Chinese in both China and overseas, even some from families who settled abroad generations ago. Chinese culture tends to be puritanical.  Most foreigners do not realize the deep differences between Chinese and Japanese cultures. The psyches are as different from each other as between East and West.   Chinese tend to be more individualistic than Japanese. For this reason, Chinese can adapt more easily than Japanese to life and customs worldwide.   What confounds the foreigner are the superficial similarities, like foods and the use of Chinese characters in writing. Plus some similarities in appearance between some Chinese and some Japanese. But an overseas Chinese person can usually distinguish on sight between Chinese and Japanese.  These are generalizations that cannot be applied to individual persons, like probabilities in throwing dice, you don't know what the next person you meet will be like.  I have lived in mainly Overseas-Chinese cities for 20 years, but would love to spend one year in Japan, maybe teaching business English, maybe learning to speak some Japanese. I met a guy who has an English father and Japanese mother. He was born in the UK and when he was teaching at a Japanese university as a post-doc, he recovered some of the language he had learned from his mother. I really envied him for that experience.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@foreveragainOK,"China has many beautiful girls.  Especially in the cities, since they migrate there.  People in general and cute girls are also usually very friendly.  For example, sales girls.  I went to a music store with a friend who spoke the dialect.  Four cute girls surrounded us.... in the next store the cute salesgirl gave us her mobile phone number.I went to a beautiful mountain town with no cars.  Surrounded by scenic hills, the streets are all level, so the transportation is by big tricycles.  Anyway, I went to a wedding store where a friend was getting marriage photos with his girl.  So I was speaking with three cute store girls, in broken Chinese.   At the end of the hour, as we walked out to the street, one of the really pretty ones came out to wave at me.  Stupidly, I didn't get her number.    But for guys with some money, the KTV  (kareoke TV) clubs are the place.  These are huge lit up, like Vegas.  But much more fun, since you're surrounded by cute girls, instead of slot machines.   There, you can 'rent a girl' and she will be your companion in the private room where your four friends etc. also have their own girl.  And they are not jaded girls, either.  You sink karaoke, play dice, drink.  One time was like a scene from a movie, with a dozen people in the room.  We were sitting on low couches with an equally low table.  The sexy assistant manager walked up to the table to me sitting in the middle.  She must have thought I was the Big Boss, and presented her card, laying it on the table.  Very cinematic, and my friends were jealous.  Btw, usually, you can also the girl home ... and not at the ridiculous prices of the video with only a handshake.",7년 전,2,

@RazeDee,"This has got to be one of the most interesting video I've ever watched ever. The most interesting part of the video to me is the girl's perspective. How she develops relationships learning about her clients but never have any type of emotional attachment with them. Like she's emotionless inside but outside she's laughing and smiling and that she looks like she's genuinely enjoying the moment. I feel like that emotionless inside is replaced by her objective mindset and straight-forwardness. And her emotions are just outside and never taken in which prevents her from being emotionally attached. I guess one of the things I've learned from this video is that to keep the mentality inside and the emotions outside and not the other way around because I feel like internalizing emotions can lead to attachment and having the mentality outside...well it can lead to a lot of things but mostly, since our brain is like an info processor, it likes to understand or solve things by itself and when it tries to understand things from the outside point of view and not from the internal, it will get lost which leads to I guess losing your own individuality.

@KVDC2008,"Whether you agree with her choice of profession or not, it's not illegal and there is a demand for her services in China.  Her approach to this work is very clinical, procedural and professional.  In a country of over a billion people, getting ahead (i.e., not working in a factory job) is not an easy task.  Clearly, there will be an inclination for good looking women to leverage their looks to gain an advantage, but that's true in many countries and societies where good career opportunities are limited.  It is interesting to see that she is doing this work long enough where she is completely devoid of romantic affection or even faking sincerity.  She's just very nonchalant or matter of fact about the whole encounter; even when being filmed.  If you are pretending to be someone's girlfriend, you got to at least pretend to be somewhat affectionate (i.e., flirting, superficial touching or caressing) with the client.  But I guess once you go down that road, the client has the wrong impression and then she gets put in a situation where money is offered in exchange for sexual acts.  Nonetheless, this is a very interesting video about modern Chinese life.",7년 전,0,

For those who don't know, which is most, escorting isn't prostitution, since they don't get paid for sex, but for the girlfriend experience. If they sell the sex to you outside of personal sexual or romantic interest, then they are prostituting. If you go to a place like Craigslist or Backpage and they say they are escorting, but selling you sex, they aren't escorting.

@mal237,"It's a sad reality but this woman is better off than the majority of North Americans. People do this line of work for a reason and she repeated it constantly: money. Whether it bothers you or not, it doesn't change that fact. And I am certain it is not only women who do this, by the way.  It's easy to judge her because we're uncomfortable with what she does, but if a man, or woman, came up to you, told you he would give you $50k to spend a day with him, would you? That amount of money can be more or less but it's the idea of basically free money that captures people. Some work endlessly for others whom they hate just to make $500 a week. Also a sad reality, if not sadder. What she does is just disturbing because it's easy and seemingly unfair to people who can't do the same.   But as cliche as it sounds, life's unfair. Not all of you here deserve what you're getting paid, whether it's too little or too much, or you're broken and jobless because of this world. What she's doing and your knowledge of it becomes irrelevant eventually because she won't stop. She'll just continue with what she's doing and move on. And you should, too.",7년 전,0,

Besides, this business is just not really that popular in China. Generally, 90 percent of these kinds of applications are used to rent a girl to play the video games with their clients. The point for this business is more like to rent a girl to keep you accompany rather than pretending your girlfriend in a relationship. I believe there are differences between the two concepts.

The trade is always, to earn real deal, you've gotta give real deal.  Girls, especially Asian girls are known to be very shy and will never share a SINGLE thing about what they had done.

In a fast developing country like China and Japan, lots of single men don’t have time to have a girlfriend. And maybe they are just not good at with connecting to girls. I know some of my friends are rich time free and they still don’t have girlfriend. It’s very complicated to explain here. So, this girl is nothing doing wrong, and she is make a good money tho.

For those that don't understand why men pay for this: ""Face"" takes a huge part. Taking a beautiful girlfriend to a business dinner or similar occasions gives you face, i.e. respect. Also, work life balance is quite off in China. People that make a lot of money often don't have the time to find a significant other. And also men don't only need sex, but get lonely.",7년 전,0,

@wassabiii600,There is a huge difference in male to female ratio in Chinas population. This is because of the one child policy thats only been lifted recently. So for decades you would only have one child. And because abortion is legal even after checking the sex of the child there has been many abortion if the childs sex if to be found as female. This is because of the cultural value that china put on males. However the social consequence of that is now rising thus many men are without female partners because of the low population of them. Thus services like this would be in high demand due to older men not being able to find a partner.,7년 전,0,

@TheVoiceICreate,"I don't think it's weird at all. I mean she's not a gold digger, she's just getting extra money, very professionally, and people know what they signed up for. As for the rich men who gave extremely large tips, it doesn't mean that they're stupid or wasting money, they're just donating a large sum of money to another person to spend or live off of. They probably won't ever go bankrupt, and likely weren't drunk since she doesn't go out to drink. It's just socializing with new people for a couple hours.",7년 전,308,
@tealuxe,"Okay, no real reason but I just want to ramble what I think. First, that rented date sucked, I would honestly just leave even if a REAL date goes that bad. I dated a Chinese girl once (app date), at the beginning it was kinda awkward, but after two hours or so (thanks to me) I was able to break the ice with her(date didn't feel force or tense after that point). We dated for a month, apparently she liked me, and she was cute too, but I didn't like somethings she told me such as she broke with her ex-boyfriend cuz... he was too much into her? like seriously? how can u even trust someone after that.  Another experience was my ex Mongolian girlfriend, first serious relationship of my life, introduced her to my family. Result? hide to me pretty dang important things, getting dumped after birthday, told me everything I did for her was ""expected"" and was ""nothing special"", and a very cold attitude towards me after we agreed to be ""friends"". Asian girls are my curse, I love them, I don't find other women as pretty as them, but man I'm scare of them. They are very cold, just like that Chinese girl. I guess it's cultural. They don't even cry, like wtf man, I felt like the woman of the relationship (feelings wise).  Another thought, I don't believe that girl, for the right amount of money you get more than just a hand shake, she's already in love with easy money, that's the biggest red flag you could ever get.",7년 전,0,

@wassabiii600,There is a huge difference in male to female ratio in Chinas population. This is because of the one child policy thats only been lifted recently. So for decades you would only have one child. And because abortion is legal even after checking the sex of the child there has been many abortion if the childs sex if to be found as female. This is because of the cultural value that china put on males. However the social consequence of that is now rising thus many men are without female partners because of the low population of them.,7년 전,9,
@benlu5362,WASSABiii it sounds you know everything but you actually know nothing. Female population born in 80s and 90s is almost equal to it of male.

@wassabiii600,"@Ben Lu: No Im not claiming I know everything and never did. I am also stating facts from articles Ive read as much as you have. But I would have to dissagree with you about ""almost equal to male"" because research claims other wise. You also have to put the ""underreporting of females"" as a huge factor to that low number. Another thing you brought up is prostitution. It isnt a viable application for this argument. Prostitution is one of the oldest form of business services existed to mankind. And china takes a huge part in it as much as any other countries in the world. Even in America tho illegal has a high case of prostitution rings and sex trafficking.  Prostitution and dating app has one huge difference. Prositution doesnt sell a relationship it sells sex. This dating service sells relationship and not sex. Thus chinese men want this because of the lack of access to real relationship because there isnt any.   Heres a popular article about chinas being one of the top countries in the world for having a large imbalanced sex ratio:   ""It is argued that sex-selective abortion continues to be one of the key factors in the notably imbalanced sex-ratio in China, as the imbalance cannot be explained solely by the underreporting of female births or by excess female infant mortality.[10] In 2001, 117 boys were born to every 100 girls.[10] These trends are explained by the persistence of a preference for sons in Chinese families.[11]""",7년 전(수정됨),2,

@SPMNDK89,"It's not the awkwardness of the interview that bothers me, it's what she said. Her sole focus in life is making money, that's it. Everything she does is essentially a transaction. I've been lucky enough to meet a wide range of successful people and some are pretty darn wealthy. But they started off with a goal in mind, not dollars and cents, they are passionate people. They didn't care how much money they made, they cared about how fulfilling their career was. They loved what they did and they stuck with it despite some failures because of that love. When you remove that factor, a lot of things in life slowly start to lose meaning. Who cares how much money you have at that point? Like she said, she'll never reject any sum of money because it's the only thing that keeps her going. When she runs out of money, living is essentially more painful than dying. And what she's doing imo is worse than prostitution. Prostitution is selling sex, but what she's doing is essentially selling desperate men, fake feelings which undermines how we build relationships. It is so unhealthy from a psychological standpoint I don't know how to start explaining it. Can you imagine this woman as a mother? What'll happen to the children? Sure not everything is certain, maybe this woman will mature and see past her unhealthy views of money and actually develop some empathy but unless life-changing events happen to her, her existence is actually pretty sad...It's ironic when she said she doesn't feel bad for the ""pathetic or pitiful"" men, because it's kind of an accurate description of her situation as well.",7년 전,4,

Asian Boss normally interviews a range of people but this was one girl, so we don't get to see different sides or different personalities of other girls.   One stark difference between this and host clubs is that with the host clubs, there's a sophisticated business model, but here, each girl sets her own rules and times of work. There's no one managing a girl or setting business objectives.  Essentially, each girl is a entrepreneur. The goal of relationship-building and ensuring your clients have a good time doesn't seem to have a place here...not with this girl anyways. This might explain her lack of ""caring"" for her client. I can imagine that girls who make more of an effort to offer better companionship obtain more dates.   It's troublesome for the mindset though for women to be in this business. She's already painted all men as ""wanting the same thing""...the longer she's in this, the more she's going to end up hating all men and thinking the worst of them.",7년 전,0,

@YCPYT,"I think if it's still in regulation and not illegal it's a good thing to have. We expect everyone can have a sister, girl friend or even just friends to accompany us when we feel alone and need someone there. Not everyone have someone . In my opinion this service have it's own positive things, in the end something bad or not depends on the people involved in it. If they have good motivations and intentions to do this, then why not?  As being no attachment etc. Again it depends on the people involved, this is a business yes but it involve real people with real feelings. We can't assume all of the ""rent"" girlfriend or boyfriend have no sincere feelings when accompanying the one who pay them and vice versa. For example when watching movies we can even sympathize with the actors even when we know it isn't real, but for that moment when we watch and reminisce about it. There's a real feeling involved and we believe for a moment it's real.  Again ofc like everything else in this world, this will have it's pro and cons. But it can have more pro than cons imo.",7년 전,0,

A woman would rarely care about how her husband feels unless he talks about it first, or its essential to ask if their relationship is in jeopardy (meaning she's going to lose security and provisions). You have no clue what you're talking about. Go date a guy and see how it's one sided 80% of the way. It comes to a point where we don't expect ANYTHING But sex after a bazillion of things we've done to win your affection.

There are more men than women in China in part due to the one-child policy (which is no longer strictly enforced) 3. For western viewers, cultures across Asia (wide range from China to India) are traditionally conservative especially in public. This includes cultures in the middle east as well 4. Loneliness and depression is considered an epidemic in the U.S. (figures are close to 44% - 50%, there are some studies out there and articles that cover this with a quick search) and most recently among young adults (previously known to be just older men); not sure if there is a study on specifically loneliness and depression in China, but it is commonly known that many men of marrying age are lonely due to the ratio inequality 5. The lady in this video is not unique in her mindset as it is common with any job to separate personal from professional 6. lol Sad Kei :'( feelsbadman",7년 전(수정됨),0,

So, it's far more difficult to get and the practice is in secrecy as it's considered a crime. Also, many Asian culture in general are far more conservative.

As a woman, I don't think this is degrading at all, period.  As for Kei, I highly doubt he has trouble getting dates with those good looks, nice smile and most importantly, the respectful way he treats women. ;)  I did want to comment on one thing, where she replied that, ""she doesn't care"" about how the men feel after the date is over... say you were admitted to a hospital for a week or more after a bad accident. You get attached to the kind nurses whom attend to you during your care.  After you're discharged, you more than likely will not see those nurses again, probably for life.  Does that mean that those nurses wouldn't care to know that you are doing well for the ""one-time"" service they performed for you?  Back to this example, I'm sure it's not that Zhuang Zhou is ""utterly inhuman and uncaring"" as some people have indirectly implied in the other comments.  It's that she, like the nurses in my example, performed a one-time service.  Just because the service highly involves the human emotion of kindness, does not negate the fact that it is STILL a one-time service.  Not to mention in Zhuang Zhou's, that the men paying for her services were told IN ADVANCE to not expect ""further feelings to develop"" from her for said services.  Basically, when you RENT a girlfriend/boyfriend, don't ask for more services than what's in the Terms of Service.  Besides all of that and based on watching her nonverbal communication, I believe that Zhuang Zhou is a VERY caring lady.  She just knows how to properly separate business from pleasure.  As for asking her if there's ever enough money, I hope that she's properly investing her money to make it grow even more!  She'll have a very easy, well-prepared retirement in her future!  I wish we could have services like this in the USA.  Unfortunately, we have too many selfish people whom would twist the system into something unsavoury and ruin it for everyone else...",7년 전,317,

Normally, both sides will talk about some service details first before the service started, for example whether they can hold hands in public... People who got high level or are well liked by their customers in this business are all very smart, vise and knows how to pleased different people to let them all feel mentally refreshed, therefore customers are willing to throw a lot of money on this even they know the person will not having physical intimacy with them. I also read that in some company in Japan or South Korea you can rent mid age or old males/females... sometimes to pretend to be the customer’s girlfriend/boyfriend(for elder customers), sometimes to pretend to be a grandparent to prevent a kid who doesn’t have grandparent from being bullied by other kids, or some times have a chat with youngsters to hear them complain about their problems and maybe give them some life advices...",7년 전(수정됨),22,

In order to stay in this business which gets good pay, she cannot let herself feel for the customers because she will get attach and it will be hard for her to continue the job even if its pity. As she said it’s to earn money to pay for her debts or whatever and no money is enough because it provides her security and ways of survival. It’s hard to earn good amount of money nowadays because once a country gets more developed and educated, higher expectations are required in people to get a job. So I think she’s just making it easier for herself even though her job is seen as heartless and cruel but at least she’s honest and those people are willing to pay her for it. As humans of course we feel emotions, I’m sure she feels, she just doesn’t want to say it to trick herself into believing she doesn’t to stay in the business. Eventually she got used to this and became professional about it. It’s now just business. We don’t know her background so we only judge what she said here but if we get to see her whole life, we might understand her better.",7년 전,3,
@maeva5489,She's not a psychologist,7년 전,0,
@miloradowicz," @happyless1135  She didn't sound particularly bitter to me, so I doubt it's some tragic drama in her past that drove her towards being less emotional. Neither did she try to justify her point. Her attempt at joking at 5:41 comes off like an attempt to make the connection with her audience and score some points, and not so much as a geniune explanation of her path of thought. I would say she's not bereft of the emotional aspect of human interaction (as was showed by her very much human reaction at 5:41), much more she deems it 'cool' to be seen as practical and ruthless. I personally doubt it was a set of unlucky circumstances and hardships that formed her into the character she is, rather a self-made mutilation of self to conform the image of success, the Zeitgeist. We Russians have seen this phenomenon in 1800's with the surfacing of nihilists, obsessed with Napoleon and their idea that being a sociopath that wrecks everything in his path like a train means success in life. She didn't said she needed money either, only that she wanted more of them, so my personal impression is that she grew up as a provincial to middle class girl without any emotional attachment to her parents, that was convinced she deserves more in life than she gets. Probably not being particularly slighted by peers, but not in the high league either. She looks much more emotionally shallow than calloused or heartless. But then again opposites often looks quite the same so it may be she had so much to overcome in life and leave behind that it became routine to her. But going by statistics, I doubt it.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

I just said this encounter is awkward and I don't understand why people think she should be excited under these circumstances.

Not to mention some of their questions were quite condescending, almost as if what she is doing is wrong or something.

I know that each one is responsible for his own money, but in the face of the service I have seen, I think this creates more illusion than satisfaction.

You can search in youtube about male escort in japan and they can earn more than this girl, as for her client that give her a lot of tips it's because they are willing to give it to her...not because she asked for it.

Imagine what the wise Chinese philosophers of the past would think and say, about how much modern China has sold its originality and heart for materialism?

@CoffLeSky," @skipperdon83  Racism is scarce. There is a difference between racism and discrimination. Propensities within a group of people to act   in particular ways that are noticeable train the mind to make correlations between appearance and actions/behaviors. This, coupled with the fact that people of external appearance and culture tend to associate and gather together also spreads and enforces the manifestation of particular behaviors and dispositions. Most people do not understand the definition and significance of racism, and instead, use it as a blanket term with loaded sentiments to invoke negative feelings towards someone who is speaking poorly of a group of people, especially of they are a minority. Racism is the belief in the inherent determinism of particular traits as to distinguish people as inferior or superior on a genetic basis. Do you really think every single person who speaks out against certain groups of people are racist? The principle is usually not any different than speaking out against Antifa, SJWs, Liberals, etc. The collective group is merely a population within a designated subset where certain qualities, ideas, or traits are being attributed to them as being greater in propensity, or characteristic of them. Similarly, when using a race as a group, it does not necessarily mean that every single member of the race is being attributed as being inherently disposed to certain stereotypes or beliefs, but rather, due to the aforementioned affects of culture amongst people of similar appearance and proximity, certain races tend to act in noticeably different ways in a generally different proportion compared to other groups, not on the basis of genetics, but other social elements. This means the basis is not ""because"" they are chinese, or black, but that they ""happen"" to be so. This is a serious distinction majority of people do not understand or realize. The dynamics of generalities actually extend much further, but ill leave the rest for you to contemplate. Here in the US, most cases of supposed racism are not only false, but cases of blacks being shot is usually due to three reasons. 1. Nearly all cases of blacks being shot by cops happens in areas where there is exponentially more crime caused by blacks, which also means cops subconsciously or consciously are much more cautious around blacks, as they have encountered plenty of cases in the past where they lie and use that to their advantage to attack cops or try to flee. 2. The ones being shot, nearly always were committing a crime right before being shot, and/or escalated the matter through aggressive language, body behavior, disobedience, and general lack of sense in rational conduct and manner. 3.Its part of human nature to be less disposed  to take risks, especially when the consequences can be deadly. Cops know about how often there is murder and hate against cops, so they are significantly more careful and even afraid of potential escalation into a dangerous situation. You cant operate on faith alone. Expectation of a possible negative circumstance, and subsequent cases where its come true is more than enough for them to be very wary afterwards. Or would you take your hot girlfriend down a dark alley in a gang infested corner of chicago because you trust that its not likely that they will do anything to you? In summary, its all about the intention and dynamics of consideration when using generalities. Discriminating against people on the basis of behavior,character, certain practices, etc is perfectly valid and sensible, even where some racial group is used as the population group, as it doesnt mean the attributed characteristics are limited to them, or that every single one of them do it, but that there is a significantly higher chance within the group to do so.",7년 전(수정됨),0,
