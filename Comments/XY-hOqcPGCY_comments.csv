@RubyTwilite,"The best way to eat a Ferrero Rocher- hear me out- is to cut it in half and put each half on a Kame Original Rice Cracker. The cracker is super crunchy and salty, and that salt totally ramps up the chocolate. Maybe its just me, but I think its amazing. Fyi I don't like smores because they are too sweet, BUT!

Also not to be dim or anything, but wouldn't it have been better to have brought two, put only half amount in each place some toothpicks the height of the thickness you wanted and them place the second on top, which would have spread the mixture evenly between each of the layers and the toothpicks would have stopped the mould from meeting completely creating a gap.  Cook for short time in oven until it sets up slightly then remove top layer and allow to cook as normal.  Doing it that way would have meant you could use the exact same amount in each so they would spread equally in each mould.  Also I think if you had painted the final layer of chocolate it wouldn't have looked like there were so many nuts, as you can see some of the nuts are inside the chocolate layer, they must double dip the chocolate.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@garrettcleland5902,"Hi Claire, and BonAppetit as a whole, I have no idea how ""submissions"" are even considered, but I have three that I think are perfect considerations, especially for the coming Summer HEAT: 1. Chipwich - What I love and miss about this once widely accessible American treat was the soft cookies that the ice cream sat between, particularly because it was something between a baked chocolate chip cookie and a disk of chocolate chip cookie dough. Cooked, but with that perfect, creamy texture. Not sure how that is even possible. The vanilla ice cream was basic and could be improved upon, but the true icing on the cake were the dark chocolate mini chocolate chips that coated the outer edge of the ice cream. A true camptime favorite! 2. ChocoTaco - This is another camp favorite and the biggest challenge choices. The dark chocolate dipped waffel cone taco--amazing! The layers of chocolate leaves between ice cream on the interior for that extra crunch--genius! The chopped nut sprinkle--complete! 3. Sour Candy - This is more an overarching category that includes many options, and it is something you still haven''t done! As someone who has to import American sour favorites, I have tried to make my own sour candies without the help of highly processed syrups (attempting all natural/organic, vegan, and low sugar options, and it is so nuanced that I think it would be a great challenge! Finding the proper balances between fruit, citrus and various food acid types is a brilliant and vibrant journey! Particular inspirations would be Sour Patch Kids, Sour Patch Watermelons, Warheads (the hard candy version with a sour burst also in the middle), Sour Cherries, original Sour Skittles, Sour Punch straws and strips, and two European favorites of mine (the only things sour enough for me in Europe): the German version of Sour Happy Cola gummies by Haribo, and a new candy in the Netherlands called Zure Matjes by a brand called Katja.",6년 전,0,

@SongsOfDragons,"Not at the bit in the video yet, but it's going to be very interesting to watch Claire make her version of Nutella. I made something Nutella-y last Christmas - I basically made hazelnut butter in my blender then kept adding cocoa powder, salt and icing sugar until I got the colour and flavour I wanted. Nowhere near the texture of the actual stuff - it was bitty and much more like rough peanut butter - and it was too dark cocoa-wise for my housemate, but it tasted amazing and is definitely something I would be making with my kid when she's old enough; Nutella is, yeah, pretty much just chocolate icing, despite it being yummy, and I found making a chocolatey hazelnut butter essentially was much nicer. Though I'm thinking of adding powdered milk next time I make it to lessen the dark richness of the cocoa the first time.  Edit: Watched it now!! Yup a nut butter!

Why dont you just place the dough into that ball plastic mold, then flip it upside down, bake it and see what happen?

@Nunar95,"One would have to test it, but im pretty sure the batter would just run down from the top of the domes to the bottom of the mold, so you would not get a uniform wafer but one that is very thin in the middle and thick at the edge. And that would not only change the eating experience, but it would probably be verry difficuld to bake all the way, without burning.   If you manage to make the batter so thick that its rollable, you could roll it out and just lay the batter between the moulds. But i don't think its possible to make the batter that thick without changing the texture.",6년 전,6,

@earlgreytempest,I love that Claire incorporated the failed nutella spread into a brownie recipe. I know this is a small thing but it shows so much appreciation for her ingredients and a refusal to just waste them because it didn't turn out right. So often I feel like fancy professional kitchens are entitled to waste ingredients (extracting a single cut of meat from a fish and throwing away the rest) and this turns into a sign of status. Other people repeat their behavior in order to also seem high class or prestigious. Gourmet food doesn't have to be wasteful. Thanks Claire!,6년 전(수정됨),0,

Because you do it.  You face it and deal with it.  And that is so hard for me sometimes and you just deal.  I know it's your job, but portraying that reality on video is helpful to me.  So often people do a montage of supposed struggle that make is all seem easy and fast.  But your series emphasizes the struggle.  How it is ISN'T easy to figure out the solution.  And that the only way out is through.  Thank you.  It helps me.",6년 전,0,

@bennettfriesen33,"Video was too long. Halfway through it, I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix my self a sandwich. But then I found out that I'm out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I'm really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I'm a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she'll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she's the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can't sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can't take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she's sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what's up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video.

I meant as a sparky if I said to my boss I want to dual trade to cablejointer or liney it's harder as the boss is likely to deny it as you already have a sparky ticket and it allows you to do a lot of things they won't waste money on dual trading you. If you are a jointer/liney and ask to be dual trade to sparky then in my experience they usually allow you to do it. They can use you for more tasks, switching work etc. I guess that all comes down to the employer as well. Where I was, it was pretty much a given that an EFM would get ther linesman ticket. It was generally part of their progression planning. Well not so much for the subs guys I guess but for the rapid response guys or EFMs in overhead.  @bones1026 ",6년 전,0,

@stevethea5250,"MADOGA writes...  what would motivate an employer to give someone a job with way out of date experience and an old degree ?  What would motivate ANYBODY to give ANYBODY a job by your reasoning? It is always tough starting out in a profession or re-entering the workforce after some time off. While difficult, eventually somebody offers most of us a job, we gain experience and after 6 months this myth about us not being able to perform due to having no experience is dispelled. OP's wife WILL get a job eventually if she keeps trying, mark my word...  Also to be fair the skill of coding hasn't changed much since 2011. Neither have network protocols...etc.  My concern is that the SE Asian degree and overseas experience will mean zero so she's starting from square 1 (and clearly 'best uni in SE Asia' is at very best a contentious claim unless it's the National University of Singapore which is ranked higher than most GO8 unis...so don't make that claim if it's some random joint in the Philippines or whatever because it's a lie).  Call me rude/cynical but when I worked in job services EVERYBODY from SE Asia was like 'oh yeah I'm an engineer/doctor/accountant/teacher...etc in my home country... best uni, very high class... but your country doesn't recognise this!!!' I'd then break down their skills and EVERY TIME I would be like 'you little liar!!! We call that skill book keeping not accounting...etc no I can't help you get a $100k a year job with an accounting firm...'  What I'd put to here is... does she legitimately have the skills required? What can she build? Give her a computer... can she make an iPhone app or something, for example? If so, why can't she setup a business and build a portfolio?  Story: my father in law is an 'architect' in SE Asia. Conversation... 'oh yeah, what kinda houses do you design?' will get the answer 'hahaha I work for the government boy... highly respected architect!!' Pretty quickly you realise that he's got some kinda TAFE qual (at best) and he's an admin clerk for the government's town planning authority, who takes bribes to approve stuff... hence why an otherwise dull job is a plumb gig in SE Asia. He makes enough money to be treated like a king over there and I have no reason to challenge him as he's family. However, his definition of 'architect' and mine are vastly different. Lesson: SE Asia is the wild west and everybody exaggerates their importance/education so such things should be taken with a grain of salt.  @kenzaghodbane5890 ",6년 전,0,

@stevethea5250," @eoinkenny3188  I currently work within an IT Business Analyst capacity, but I am considering redirecting my career into a technical specialisation (I've always been more hands on throughout my life/ studies and analysing business needs all day isn't satisfying my own).  Based on what I've seen in the industry thus far, the specialist area would ideally constitute of the following:  1. The technology surrounding the specialisation would be relatively 'static' (not subject to huge amounts of change over short periods of time) – working with applications I've seen a revolving door of programming languages/ frameworks. Ideally I want a specialisation where its possible to 'learn it all', or where continuous learning is required but not to an overwhelming extent  2. The jobs associated with the specialisation aren't predominately application/ technology specific – using developers for example, I can see majority of the roles on seek are for specific frameworks/ applications – I just don't want to get pigeon holed.  3. The job outlook for the specialisation is strong in Australia, with little chance of my role getting off-shored within the immediate future.  4. Essentially the specialisation could be considered life long and will require certifications/ licences to operate in that capacity – something like the IT equivalent of an Electrician  I am open to all suggestions, including those on the infrastructure that may require additional Uni/ Tafe. I am currently leaning towards Networking. Any ideas would be very much appreciated!",6년 전,0,

They enhance the color, flavor, and preserve the texture as the chips sit a long time in the packaging. So while not healthy they are actual tortilla chips.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@lasoob,I feel like you needed a sphere made of silicone or something that was smaller than the molds by the right amount to get the perfect thickness to the wafer. It would need to have a lip around it too to prevent it falling to the bottom of the mold completely. Then the batter could have been cooked with the sphere pressing it into the right shape and uniform thickness. I know nothing about wafers or baking difficult things though so maybe silicone wouldn't have worked or it would break the wafer apart after cooking 😏,6년 전,0,

@iamindigobaby,"But she's making a ""hollow"" spheres shell, how's egg puff waffle iron or ebelskiniver iron help?  For one thing the iron has to be preheated, and if Claire drops the batter onto the iron then flip for excess, she still has to do it one by one (not to mention it might be messier) because within 10 seconds, the batter will be cooked in the heated iron. Also, with this way, she won't be able to control the thickness.",6년 전(수정됨),5,
@TheWitchvortex," @iamindigobaby   Oh no, it's not a puff waffle and not the æbleskiver.  This iron closes the same way, as the one in the video, but the bottom side is hollow and the top side is the opposite.  It's like a press mold, and it creates half semisperes, not round balls. They look like half egg shells, when they are ready.",6년 전,0,

@Livin-Da-Vida-Loca,Jay Who said anything about a title? I was referring to the fact that a supposedly professional pastry chef doesn’t know how to make nut butter and had to google it. I went to culinary school and I didn’t even major in pastry and it’s basic stuff.  Second of all you sound like a person thumbing through the dictionary. Nobody is pointing out any differences in the title or attempting to discern the meaning of it. Perhaps learn what words mean before you spout them off and look like a fool.,6년 전,0,

@brianoleary25,"BROTHERS AND SISTERS ACROSS THE EARTH!!! I AM  A RETIRED POLICE LIEUTENANT!!! TRYING TO GET CHRISTIANITY BACK INTO THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF USA !!! YOU TUBE IS NOT GIVING MY CHANNEL ANY CREDIT FOR ALL THE PEOPLE COMING TO SEE MY TWO VIDEOS!!!! PLEASE PROTEST AGAINST THEM !!!! I WILL NOTIFY ALL MY FRIENDS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT NOT TO UTILIZE YOU TUBE NO MORE ALSO!!!!! GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES IN JESUS MIGHTY NAME!!!  AND I HOPE TO SEE YOU ALL IN THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN!!! ATTENTION ALL CHURCHES !!! Please let me share to my brothers and sisters my testimony !!! At your church!!!  There is much knowledge to obtain from it !!!  It has caused many to have stronger FAITH in our Lord and savior Jesus Christ of Nazareth !!! And God the Father and the Holy Spirit !!!!!  Please let me be an instrument for them!!!  To bring more souls into the Kingdom of Heaven!!!  ALL I HAVE DONE AND ALL I WANT TO DO FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE IS TO BRING SOULS INTO THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN!!! I DONT WANT NOTHING IN RETURN !!! HERE IS MY TESTOMONY !!!  I am a retired police Lieutenant and have been Following the Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth for approximately 30 years !!!  I have been through many trials and tribulations and never gave up on the Father , son and Holy Spirit !!! In return I have received the Holy Spirit from Jesus after God the Father approved it !!! to be given to me. AMEN FOR JESUS !!! My level of Holy Spirit is extremely high !!! Due to the long term severity of my trials that I passed and never faltered with my faith !!! I have many Gifts of the Holy Spirit !!! Amen !!! In this life I have received many gifts to, for fighting against sinning and spreading the gospel which is a reflection of Jesus.   I been spreading the gospel to all four corners of the earth, by way of the internet chat rooms and now Facebook for many years and on foot giving out free bibles and food to all God brings into my path!!! And I never ask for anything in return !!! Jesus gave freely !!! Therefore so do I !!! I also give to ministries to help spread the truth in the world !!! Which is Jesus.  John 14:6 Jesus answered, ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. (Friends, Fight against sinning!!!) The world, satan=Lies and deception. Bible, Jesus = truth and Justice.  READ YOUR BIBLES FRIENDS !!!    AMEN FOR JESUS !!!! God bless you and your families in Jesus MIGHTY name !!!! THE MOST POWERFUL NAME ON EARTH !!! Jesus was manifested to destroy the works of the devil and his kingdom !!!   Grab hold of Jesus and fight against SINNING !!! We are warriors for Jesus !!! FIGHT !!! FIGHT !!! FIGHT !!! DESTROY SATAN AND HIS DEMONS AND KINGDOM !!! Follow Jesus ways FRIENDS !!! He is our example how to live. When you do this you graduate training camp and are ready for battle!!! AMEN !!! FOUR (4) KEY POINTS TO GETTING THE HOLY SPIRIT AND FINDING FAVOR WITH GOD THE FATHER AND JESUS AND THE HOLY SPIRIT !!!!   NUMBER ONE (1): FAITH BUILD YOUR FAITH BY READING YOUR BIBLES CONSTENTLY!!! ESPECIALLY ABOUT JESUS !!! SINCE HE IS OUR EXAMPLE HOW LIVE AND GET INTO THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN!!! Hebrews 11:6 And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him. NUMBER TWO (2) Fight against sinning !!! Luke 9:23 And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me. (Friends fight against sinning!!) Learn all the Ten commandments and sins/things that send you to hell written in the Bible!!!  Make a list !!! there are many !!! AND FIGHT AGAINST THEM !!! Discipline your flesh !!! When God the father sees you do this!!! He finds you worthy to let Jesus send you the Holt Spirit!!! When this happens, the Holy Spirit will stop you from committing any sins you been having trouble with and then you can actually live a sin free life!!! REMEMBER: Jesus always said after he helped someone:   GO AND SIN (NO MORE!!!) With God the father and Jesus and the Holy Spirit!!! ALL THINGS ARE POSSIABLE FRIENDS!!!!!!! AMEN!!! THIRD (3rd): You must spread the gospel !!! James 2:26 ""As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. If you are embarrassed of Jesus. He will be embarrassed of you !!! when he Judges you before his father in Heaven !!! Do not be a coward!!! the bible says cowards go to hell and fear is from satan, which is a sin!!!  2 Timothy 1:7 “For God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.” (For Christians!!!) Friends don’t waste any time doing these two things prior mentioned!!! FOURTH  (4th): Take care of your body !!! 1 Corinthians 3:16-17 16Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in your midst? 17If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy that person; for God's temple is sacred, and you together are that temple.

I want to make the best vibes possible so if anyone else in a dark situation could hopefully escape with my music.

There is no such disclaimer, but apparently there is a loophole where you can simply mention or display the product without directly promoting it which allows people to forego disclosure. The timing which these videos come out and how the product is always lavishly laid out is just too suspicious. There's been a sudden uptick in Ferrero Rocher videos, and it's right around valentines so all the boxes tick. In that case I'd like to see Nestle sponsor an Aero chocolate video, so that I can learn to make that at home lol",6년 전,2,

@Dispeckful,It's topical because of Valentine's day. FR is highly protective of their process. Doubtful that they'd pay someone to try and recreate something they guard so fiercely. Same with most other items.   Not sure what loophole would allow them not to disclose. Those rules are pretty rigid and clear.  Some bloggers even get in trouble if they only include a blanket statement on their blog instead of the actual post.,6년 전,2,
@masha7377,"Nah you don't have to disclose gifted items in the US when there's no contract or extra payment. They can contact Ferrero and hope for a package. But that's about it. Ferrero doesn't need this channel for promotion. Besides, the cost of the snacks isn't very high for a big company like Condé Nast. They pay One World Trade Center rent, the space that those snacks take up is probably more valuable than they themselves. Oh, and as a business, they don't have to go to regular stores like we do but can probably get them at a wholesale supplier for ~20-40% (that's an estimate of the price difference of different goods in Germany) less.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@fordhouse8b,"@@Home Love The appropriateness of giving a host something has very little to do with it being cheap or not. Ferrero Rocher is a finished product, delicious, attractively packaged, and as far as gifts go, pretty cheap. I love them, and would much appreciate them as a gift. Nutella itself would be an odd gift, unless it came as part of a gift basket, then it would be lovely. Most ingredients in candy and desserts are cheap, starting with sugar. And no, I would not expect a Michelin star restaurant to serve McDonald's french fries. Possibly their own french fries, which are made with, surprise, the fact same ingredients as McDonald's fries. Nor would I compare an an appropriate everyday hostess gift with a Michelin star restaurant. If, as a guest, my ambition was to be 'classy' on a Michelin star level, I absolutely do not think a box of Ferrero Rocher would suffice. Something like Godiva would be more appropriate for such an occasion.",6년 전(수정됨),0,
@fordhouse8b,"@ @greengaby9  I don't know what supermarket you go to, but the vast majority of them will not have champagne at the checkout lines. I very purposefully wrote supermarket CHECKOUT LINES in the post you are replying to. Sorry about the all caps, not intending to yell, just emphasizing that I was specifically referring to that location within the store. Also, there is nothing inherently un-classy or inappropriate about Fererro Rocher, I like them a lot. The fellow I was responding to basically put them in the same class as a Michelin star restaurant dish, while placing Nutella in on the level of fast food french fries (chips to you?) In that sense, they are comparatively not 'classy' (fancy) at all.",6년 전,0,

@InMyGlamEra,"This video was too long. Halfway through it, I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix my self a sandwich. But then I found out that I'm out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I'm really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I'm a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she'll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she's the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can't sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can't take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she's sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what's up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video. She said, you know what, I've been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer. So we opened that drawer, and lo and behold, there's my phone and this video still has two minutes of play time on it.",6년 전,37,

It also seems like when they market items in a country other than the products’ original market, like USA/Poptarts, the product isn’t as good in the new market. If that makes sense? Like I’ve had kinder chocolate here in the US, which was meh, but I had the same type of kinder in Germany and it was 👍🏻 Maybe it’s a freshness thing if the products are all made in one place and shipped... why am I thinking so hard about this omg 🤣",6년 전,2,

@doraima29,"Wowee!, my suggestion came true. These are delightful. Everytime I watch Brad in the show. His suggestion always works when to have a thicker wafer. I will try that. It is also clever that Ferrero thought of a chocolate snack featuring their flagship product Nutella in the 1990s. Second, 3 years ago which is only available in Europe -they introduced a Spring limited time edition collection featuring fruits and white chocolate coating. It tasted horrible. But anway, I can make it better making a better ganache for the fruit flavors and putting tiny bits of fruit in it. Then covered in a wafer. Then coated with white chocolate.  The Rafaello is just a coconut version of it too! I even LOL about Brad naming New Rochelle balls. I think Ferrero Rocher sounds more sophisticated. Rochelle balls sounds too Americanized.

@Slayer420TV,This might sound ridiculous but I am so glad that this was the first video that appeared on my homepage when I opened YouTube this evening. I don't usually leave comments on videos nor have I ever been this open on a public forum but I felt I had to. I had been really struggling with my depression the last few weeks. In fact right before this I was searching for something to cut myself with but since I couldn't find anything I thought it better to just find a distraction to keep my mind off how bad I felt. Claire's videos on BA are my favourite thing and I've scoured the Internet to make sure I've seen every single one because she is just my absolute fave. There is something I find weirdly calming about her videos and this one in particular saved me from doing something stupid like relapsing back into self harm after having been clean for a year after suffering for almost 10 years.  So this is just a silly comment to say thank you so much for continuing to make videos with BA and BA for just being an overall fun and amazing channel. You guys really helped me out tonight even if you were just doing your jobs.,6년 전,147,

@d4n4nable,"It's always Nutella, but Nutella is not the same thing all over the world. This changes over time, and today Nutella is more uniform than in the past, afaik, but it's still the case.   For instance, German Nutella is much thicker than French Nutella. One reason for that is probably that German (half-)rye bread is a lot sturdier than French white bread. The latter would tear up with the German version as a spread, while the rye bread holds form. Things like that are true all over the place. Eastern European Nutella is (or at least used to be) made with more palm oil and fewer hazelnuts and less chocolate than the German version. This might be for cost/price reasons, or for similar preference reasons. So it's very much possible that the Australian version has thicker filling than the US version, since its Nutella might be different.",6년 전,31,

@rabooey,"Is this ""normal Claire"" or am I seeing ""phone-it-in Claire""?  Whatever made her think that the blender was the better choice over the food processor?  And she decided to use flexible silicon molds over sturdy plastic molds even though she already knew she'd be pressing the wafer dough into molds?  And  the filling was already thick and never needed freezing or even chilling, all she needed to do was fill each half-shell with the filling, press a hazelnut into one half and then press the other half on top of it.  Any overflow could have simply been scraped off since they're being over-coated with chocolate/crushed hazelnuts anyway.  Omg and what's with the double dipping technique?  With proper portioning she could have just made a mix of the chocolate and crushed hazelnuts, dipped only once, and achieved a much closer result(as was witnessed by Brad).  I'm happy for her success in creating a great reproduction of the finished product but I saw zero thought put into this endeavor.  She made this so much harder than it needed to be, was this just a really bad episode or is this normal for her?  An ""A"" for the result, a ""D"" for the process.",6년 전,0,

I’m just pointing out that the ingredients listing at the beginning is all about making you feel like the store bought are somehow filled with unnecessary stuff, when in many cases she ultimately ends up using most of the same stuff or at least as many ingredients.",6년 전,0,

You're Bon Appetit I trust you as my wikipedia of food!!! You cannot find out in this challenge that Ferrero makes both Nutella and Rocher.... what's going to happen when we get into Kinder territory and it blows out that's that's ferrero too? (Don't know if you have kinder bueno in the US but that's basically nutella too, less chocolate, more hazelnut).

@jessicas253,"Sometimes I feel like Claire is doing things way too complicated. Like the wafer: There are actually irons that you can buy to bake perfect hemispheres. In Russia they always make these nut shaped wafer things for Easter and fill it, too. It's a pain in the neck to cut and shape these things by hand! Also I think the coating is milk chocolate with chopped hazelnuts already mixed in it. So you simply coat it with that mixture. That way the nut chocolate ratio would've been like the original.   It's always funny to me as a European that Americans just don't know about these traditional sweets from other countries and how they're made. Getting that hemisphere wafer iron was my first thought. 🤷🏼‍♀️",6년 전,5,

@Zeis,"This was a really fun episode. Love Claire and this series in general. However, I feel like lately the series has gone from ""Let's make a better, gourmet version of this common treat"" to ""Let's try to recreate this common treat as close as possible"". Especially with the episode before this one, it seemed to be all about recreating the thing as closely as possible instead of making an actual gourmet version.  Here, for example, I would've loved to see a better cream on the inside. Why not a dark chocolate-coffee mousse? And a more interesting nut than hazelnut, let's say macadamia. Or maybe make a pistachio version. Why not different versions, see what's the best? There could've been so much improvement on the chocolate itself, too, and the wafers. Something akin to stroopwafels maybe? To me, a gourmet version of a Rocher would be something that looks like a Rocher, has the same basic building blocks (nut inside, covered in filling, enveloped by a spherical wafer, covered in more nut brittle, covered in chocolate) but uses far better ingredients and variations of the original.  I'm not hating on Claire or the show, just trying to offer some constructive criticism. Like I said, I do love the show and I do enjoy it a whole lot.

@The_CKY,"When she had the oil of her ""nutella"" attempt separated from the solids I really understood her struggle.  Short story time: When I was a baker in france, we used to do lots of marzipan for the holidays, which is basically almond powder with syrup and then kneaded. If you were not careful enough and the dough got too warm by an excess of kneading, the almond oil will separate 10 out of 10 times, and when the oil starts to come out, YOU'RE SCREWED, there's no way to put that mofo back in again. So you're basically stuck having a pool of oil and some chunks of sweet, sticky almond paste.  Claire, I feel you sis. I really do.",6년 전,236,

@whyRedshoes,"If only Claire had a food scientist to consult with on these projects.  I know that people like to bash on ""dirty ingredient lines"" but there is a specific reason for each and every ingredient in packaged products like ferrero rochers.  The filling kept breaking because of the interaction of oils and water in the ingredients. Lecithin is an emulsifier used to prevent that.  And palm oil is used for its specific melting point and overall fatty acid profile which is what gives nutella the texture it has.  When you make fundamental changes to the chemistry of the product, it greatly changes the flavor delivery, texture, stability, everything.",6년 전,1,

He’d frequently get a tank of liquid nitrogen and we’d spend a day playing with it. If you fill a bowl with liquid nitrogen then drop chocolate milk in it freezes into little spheres fish it out with. Mesh strainer let it warm up a little so it’s not dangerously cold and eat.   If you eat it straight out of the liquid nitrogen your tongue will freeze to your lips and possibly give you frost bite. I learned that the hard way.,6년 전,0,

@stevethea5250,"JohnMJ writes...  lineman is what I really want to do  Hey mate I'm a qualified electrical fitter mechanic (electrician) that did my apprenticeship at and still work for a supply authority. I think you'll find it is competitive to be a linesman but not as competitive as say an electrician position is. My biggest regret when completing my application was for not selecting linesman as my preferred trade. My company hires linesman, communication technicians, electricians and cablejointers. However during my intake they were only looking for electricians or linesman. Being young and dumb I didn't know what a linesman was so chose electrician.  I had to do two maths tests, general aptitude, mechanical aptitude, literacy and a personality test. Then a panel interview and a fit for work appointment and drug test.  I was fortunate in my company as unlike lots of supply authorities the electricians aren't confined to zone substation work. In my time I did lots of linesman work such as stringing overhead services, running bundled conductors and streetlights. Also did a lots of cablejointer work such as terminating HV cables into switchgear, HV cable pulls down streets and HV cablejoints. Even HV cable terminations on top of powerpoles. As an electrician I was also allowed to do lots of LV switching work, LV cable joins, transformer work, no power complaints and was lucky in that aspect because lots of callouts and overtime.  Overall the electrician is a better trade but from my work experience at the company I'm more comfortable doing cablejointing and linesman work then say control wiring or house wiring. I've also seen lots of cablejointers and linesman dual trade to electricians but its a lot harder for an electrician to dual trade the other way. Also lots of work for linesman and cablejointers out there and usually good money working for supply authorities.  money_killer writes...  Don't waste your time become an electrician pleanty more opportunities  Yes there is more demand for electricians but its such a big field and mostly its for domestic sparkys. I did my apprenticeship at a power authority and I kick myself constantly for not being a linesman. I'm a lot more comfortable doing HV cable joins or stringing conductors/pole work then I am wiring houses.  I could get a job wiring houses but I have almost zilch experience in it. Plus a lot easier to get an electrical apprenticeship then a linesman as they don't come up often. I've seen many linesman become leccys but not the other way around. @Boop Doop",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@sylviecharlois1165," B Vegan  I am still waiting to see anywhere a vegan zealot explain to me what will happen to the myriads of animals that are today used for their meat/milk/eggs/by products if the world decides to go vegan... Because if we no longer use them for meat and other by products, what will be their use ? Who will feed the countless animals, care for them until their natural death, dispose of the corpses ? By the way have you ever seen a sheep that has never been shorn ? It is crippled by its own wool ! Become vegan and sentence all the animals we use for food not to death, but to extinction ! Because once they become useless, there will be only so many people willing and able to care for a glorified lawnmower... And also, explain to me how you will deal with the millions of workers whose jobs will have disappeared ? How will you tell people whose whole culture is based on raising cattle that they are monsters who should renounce their cultural heritage (the Masai come to mind)? Will you go to every remote corner of the planet and tell the last ""primitive"" cultures, in the forest of Amazonia and remote islands, that they must not eat meat ? You would also probably have to deforest huge amounts of land in order to create new fields, because when you stop eating meat, you have to replace animal protein by vegetable protein, and so grow it. The simple amount of water necessary is staggering. And since you need the bees to take care of the pollen issue but you can't exploit bees, because you are vegan and don't exploit animals, good luck with fruit-bearing trees.... Veganism is a beautiful and impractical utopia. And the sole preoccupation of privileged western-type societies who don't lack for food. For myself, I simply hate the zealot who tries to ram down my throat its convictions, however valid they may be. And vegans are sometimes the worst, because the instant you dare say you like meat, they call you a monster, murderer, torturer, you name it. I don't eat much meat, because I don't like it that much, but these zealots almost make me want to go and have a big steak ! And to close this chapter, you could have nicely commented ""I'm a vegan, can you offer an alternative way of doing this ?"" instead of launching on a preachy, holier-than -thou tirade about veganism. By the way, I have been drinking milk every day for 56 years, I eat eggs several times a week, I use butter, I enjoy my occasional slice of foie gras (what can I say, I am french, from the SouthWest, and proud of my culinary heritage) and I have zero cholesterol, a heart in mint condition, perfectly functioning bowels, very healthy bones, as my latest medical tests showed, and I look about 10 years younger than my actual age, with nearly flawless, almost wrinkle-free skin !",6년 전,5,

She certainly had a more humane death than most humans I know-- she was hearded into a room slightly confused, followed by a bolt being driven through her skull. She felt no pain, was definitely NOT tortured, and was dead within 3/10ths of a second. Most people I know die from murder, illness, fires and car accidents.

@MMA_Mattie,"Excuse me BV but having lived in SW France and had to put up with the attitude of many like this on a daily basis, I would like to answer this if I may :D 'I am still waiting to see anywhere a vegan zealot explain to me'  Have you ever considered it may be your lazy entitled attitude that has prevented your education?   1) 'what will happen to the myriads of animals that are today used for their meat/milk/eggs/by products' The world will not go vegan overnight so the scenario is a falsehood which highlights the lack of thought you have put into this. These are not naturally occurring births, the animals are forced to become pregnant to create more. The number of animal slaves kept for food at any moment reflects the demand for related animal products. As the demand decreases so will the number of animals in slavery. If we stopped breeding cows today almost all human created cows would be dead within 5 or 6 years. All horribly killed then decapitated, their hands and feet cut off, their skin ripped off and their bodies cut up. Have you seen any slaughterhouse footage of cows being 'processed'?   2) 'By the way have you ever seen a sheep that has never been shorn' Sheep have been selectively bred to grow far more hair than they would normally and they now need human intervention, whereas in nature they would not. All sheep are killed once their hair yield drops below a certain point, mostly around 4 years old. They could live to be 12. Have you seen any slaughterhouse footage of sheep getting their throats cut?   3) 'Become vegan and sentence all the animals we use for food not to death, but to extinction' So you want to keep a cycle of slavery, forced pregnancy and killing of 70 Billion land animals every year going just so that animals who are no longer like their natural counterparts do not become extinct? Chickens grown for their bodies grow so fast that at just 6 weeks old they are killed before their legs break and they die where they fall. What do you want to do with them? Put them in a zoo so that imbeciles can point at them and laugh? You don't care about animals, all you care about are your taste buds.  4) 'And also, explain to me how you will deal with the millions of workers whose jobs will have disappeared' The number of humans who need feeding will not decrease, the population is increasing. Most of us have to retrain at some point. If you genuinely care about the people working in these industries why aren't you trying to help them? Many slaughterhouse workers rely on alcohol and drugs to get through the horrors of their day and take it out on the animals then go home and take it out on their spouses and children. Many end up with PTSD. Families end in divorce. Children lose parents. Why do you want them kept in their nightmare? So you can have a moments taste pleasure?   5) 'You would also probably have to deforest huge amounts of land' You have literally done no research before spewing out this rubbish. The rainforests are being cut down at the rate of 2 acres every second to graze animals and to grow crops to fatten animals for human consumption. We already grow enough crops to feed 12 Billion people yet there are less than 8 Billion of us on the planet.  6) 'you have to replace animal protein by vegetable protein, and so grow it. The simple amount of water necessary is staggering' What is staggering is that once again, you have no idea, yet it is so easy to educate yourself. It takes around 1,000 litres of water to create 1 litre of cow's milk and 2,500 gallons of water to grow 1lb of 'beef'. A 1/4lb burger takes 600 gallons of water to create which is the equivalent of 2 months of showering for one human. 900 gallons of water are needed for 1lb of cheese and 500 for 1lb of eggs. There is simply no comparison. Consuming a vegan diet saves more than 1,000 gallons of water every day.  7) 'For myself, I simply hate the zealot who tries to ram down my throat its convictions, however valid they may be' Yes I can feel your hate towards someone attempting to decrease the violence on Earth and to help stop us all from destroying the planet we live on. He has done nothing to deserve your hate, you must be so nice to live with. Nobody was trying to ram anything down your throat, you just turned up here all on your own, desperate to promote yourself and to justify the horror that you put defenceless animals through. Do you realise that the fist ramming the knife into the animal's throat was paid to do so by you?  8) 'And vegans are sometimes the worst, because the instant you dare say you like meat, they call you a monster, murderer, torturer' Two of those are true. The 'monster' part depends on whether or not a person decides to continue once they are aware of the violence they are putting the animals through. But how today's vegans see you is the least of your worries. You are wilfully on the wrong side of history and there will come a time when your actions will be judged by all, including your own grandchildren for helping destroy their planet and for the selfish and horrific way you did it.  9) 'I enjoy my occasional slice of foie gras' Ramming pipes into the throats of ducks and geese to force feed them 3 times a day until their livers swell to 10 times their normal size then killing them for a moment's taste pleasure, you must be so proud of special entitled you. Do you really wonder why people might consider your behaviour monstrous? Everyone else already knows.  10) 'I look about 10 years younger than my actual age, with nearly flawless, almost wrinkle-free skin' I see that you are so in love with how you look that the only photo you post is from more than 10 years ago. Being overweight can help make people look younger as the impacted fat forces the wrinkles out, however you don't appear very healthy to me, physically or mentally.",6년 전,1,
