Let no one seek his own, but each one the other’s well-being. Eat whatever is sold in the meat market, asking no questions for conscience’ sake; for “the earth is the Lord ’s, and all its fullness.” If any of those who do not believe invites you to  dinner, and you desire to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no question for conscience’ sake. But if anyone says to you, “This was offered to idols,” do not eat it for the sake of the one who told you, and for conscience’ sake; for “the earth is the Lord ’s, and all its fullness.” “Conscience,” I say, not your own, but that of the other. For why is my liberty judged by another man’s conscience? But if I partake with thanks, why am I evil spoken of for the  food  over which I give thanks? Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. Give no offense, either to the Jews or to the Greeks or to the church of God, just as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.

@r-key1656,"Mohammed Alghamdi  Here is another quote from The Word of God:  There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews...  Jesus answered, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.  That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.  Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’  The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.” Nicodemus answered and said to Him, “How can these things be?” Jesus answered and said to him, “Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not know these things?  Most assuredly, I say to you, We speak what We know and testify what We have seen, and you do not receive Our witness.  If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?  No one has ascended to heaven but He who came down from heaven, that is, the Son of Man who is in heaven.  And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,  For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.   For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.  “He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.    And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.  But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God.” John 3:1‭, ‬5‭-‬14‭, ‬16‭-‬21 NKJV http://bible.com/114/jhn.3.1-21.NKJV",8년 전(수정됨),2,

Denmark — Muslim 2% Germany — Muslim 3.7% Spain — Muslim 4%  At 5% they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their   percentage of the population. They will push for the introduction of halal (clean by Islamic   standards) food, thereby securing food preparation jobs for   Muslims. They will increase pressure on supermarket chains to   feature it on their shelves — along with threats for failure to   comply. France — Muslim 8% United Kingdom — Muslim 5% Sweden — Muslim 5% Netherlands — Muslim 5.5% Trinidad &Tobago — Muslim 5.8%  When Muslims reach 10% of the population, they increase   lawlessness as a means of expressing their grievances. Any action   perceived as un-Islamic results in uprisings and threats. Guyana — Muslim 10% India — Muslim 13.4% Israel — Muslim 16% Kenya — Muslim 10% Philippines 10%  After reaching 20% they engage in rioting, jihad militia   formations, sporadic killings and church and synagogue burnings: Ethiopia — Muslim 32.8%  At 40% you find widespread massacres, terror attacks and militia   warfare: Bosnia — Muslim 40% Chad — Muslim 53.1% Lebanon — Muslim 59.7% Nigeria—50.4%  From 60% you may expect unfettered persecution of non-believers   and other religions, sporadic ethnic cleansing (genocide), use of   Sharia Law as a weapon and Jizya, the tax placed on infidels: Albania — Muslim 70% Malaysia — Muslim 60.4% Qatar — Muslim 77.5% Sudan — Muslim 70%  After 80% expect ethnic cleansing and genocide: Egypt — Muslim 90% Indonesia — Muslim 86.1% Iran — Muslim 98% Iraq — Muslim 97% Pakistan — Muslim 96% Syria — Muslim 90%  100% will usher in the peace of ‘Dar-es-Salaam’ — the Islamic   House of Peace — there’s (supposed) to be peace because everybody   is a Muslim:  Of course, that’s not the case. Muslims then start killing each   other for a variety of reasons... Afghanistan — Muslim 100% Somalia — Muslim 100% Yemen — Muslim 100%",8년 전,1,

@ingvild2789,"+ev0se7en +ev0se7en first of all, if you're killing to survive, then at least you have a good reason for it. Meat-eaters generally can't come up with any other reason than enjoying the taste. (I'd love to hear your relevant and serious arguments for eating meat). Poorer nations typically eat less animal products anyway because veganism is cheaper. And if you really care about the people struggling to feed themselves then cut back on the meat, because there's enough plants on this planet to feed every single mouth. But obviously most people are too egocentric, lazy and misinformed to realize that we can literally end world hunger just by not filtering out nutrients through someone else's body",9년 전,0,

At least in foreign countries, their agricultural laws are a lot more reasonable, clean, more strict and less corporate...unlike the US.  In the US, the animals suffer from the first day their born: they feed them by-products of GMO corn to fatten them up and give them all kinds of diseases, it's pretty much a life of agony when you're fed something that only makes you fat and does not give the animal the necessary quintessential nutrients it needs to live a normal life.  They get rid of all these diseases by spraying an ass ton of chemicals all over the meat as a means to disinfect.  Most of all these chemicals have proven to give people cancer.  At least in most foreign countries, that pig will live a decent life, being fed the normal food that it's meant to eat on a day-to-day basis and than at the end it suffers a couple minutes of knowing it will be slaughtered.

Meanwhile, I am going to finish my degree in May, 2016. I have a lot of questions to being a vegan happily! My questions to you are! How and Why do you become a vegan? Why do you want to become a vegan? How could you survive without eating animals products? How much money do you need to be a healthy vegan? What is your diets? Do you have friends who eat always meat? Do you have many vegan friends? Do you have vegan boyfriend Or girlfriend? The last question, I want to be a vegan forever what should I do?

@brandtmccall5184,"+William Beattie Hi William.  A plant based is far more resource efficient, including of land and water then a meat centered diet.     The United Nations now actively encourages people to eat a largely plant based diet to conserve land, water and other resources.     Eating a plant based diet is not only healthier and kinder to animals but it is socially responsible, meaning eating meat has a very high social cost that the rest of society via taxes ect.. has to make up for.   ie. it takes about 450 gallons of water to produce one pound of beef, but only about 200 to grow a pound of very healthy lentils, livestock production is very water intensive.   If everyone in California at a plant based diet, California would not have the water shortages they have.      As well about 60% of the deforestation in the Brazilian rain forest is for cattle ranching, the US has similar numbers.   There is also a tremendous amount of animals poop that seeps from these operations which cause prolific algae blooms in water supplies.    This is a poop has nutrients in it that cause algae to flourish, when there is to much algae they use up all the oxygen that is needed for other organisms thus die offs happen.   Thus the lifestock industry creates immense amounts of water pollution.    My undergrad is economics and environmental studies.     A concept we learnt was how inefficient animal agriculture is with a huge environmental footprint far more so than growing plants ie. beans, nuts, fruit/veg ect....",9년 전,7,

I don't get how hard that concept is:  If the world stops consuming animal products -> we could kill them off instantly -> a few billions die, we go back to plants which are the actual food source (the animal is always a middle-man)  If we continue what we do -> a few billions die every 2 months after living a life full of pain and misery",9년 전,0,

It simply creates lower values throughout the whole supply chain; low animal welfare in favour of quantity (not quality), low margins for farmers who have to produce in this way to be profitable, low wages for processing/logistics staff meaning the only people who will do the job are migrant workers exporting revenue away from the economy. I prefer eating beef and lamb because it is raised outside in a more natural way. I don't eat pork because I believe it is a low quality product. Any animals raised like this will produce meat of poor taste and low nutritional content. Unfortunately, in Holland and Germany, this seems to be the ""only"" way to keep pigs. The answer is...just eat less meat! If meat was produced in a more traditional natural way with a higher retail price, animal welfare would improved, the economy would grow, and average wages would increase in line with food/living costs.  ",10년 전,3,

It completely lacks cognitive capacity.   Animals on the other hand do have cognitive capacity Now humans obviously are smarter, and can do probably feels things that almost no other animal does.

But to completely dismiss that there might be some moral aspects to eating animals, is i bit immature.

More expensive meat means less consumption which in turns means 1) better meat quality/taste; 2) less farmed animals therefore less pollution/waste of resources; 3) ethical farms where the farmers can put passion into raising the animals because they are not stressed by the consumers' crazy demand and make enough money to really put passion into it; 4) animals have a longer/better life;  5) better health for people.  I personally buy my meat from local farmers which means that due to the cost of the meat and the discomfort of going to the farm every time I would probably eat meat 4-5 times a month. But that means that I'm more healthy and I eat great tasting meat every single time.

@larppa666,"It is necessary for animals to be stress and injury free during operations prior to slaughter, so as not to unnecessarily deplete muscle glycogen reserves. It is also important for animals to be well rested during the 24-hour period before slaughter. This is in order to allow for muscle glycogen to be replaced by the body as much as possible (the exception being pigs, which should travel and be slaughtered as stress free as possible but not rested for a prolonged period prior to slaughter). It is important that the glycogen levels in the muscles of the slaughtered carcass are as high as possible, to develop the maximum level of lactic acid in the meat. This acid gives meat an ideal pH level, measured after 24 hours after slaughter, of 6.2 or lower. The 24h (or ultimate) pH higher than 6.2 indicates that the animal was stressed, injured or diseased prior to slaughter.  Lactic acid in the muscle has the effect of retarding the growth of bacteria that have contaminated the carcass during slaughter and dressing. These bacteria cause spoilage of the meat during storage, particularly in warmer environments, and the meat develops off-smells, colour changes, rancidity and slime. This is spoilage, and these processes decrease the shelf life of meat, thus causing wastage of valuable food. If the contaminating bacteria are those of the food poisoning type, the consumers of the meat become sick, resulting in costly treatment and loss of manpower hours to the national economies. Thus, meat from animals, which have suffered from stress or injuries during handling, transport and slaughter, is likely to have a shorter shelf life due to spoilage. This is perhaps the biggest cause for meat wastage during the production processes. I found this",11년 전,32,
