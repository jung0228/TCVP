@tubestick00,"Its human nature.  In our culture women are free to wear what they want. With almost no exceptions other than complete nudity.  It reveals that when left to their own devices women will dress 8n a very revealing and provocative outfit, while they are at home they are deciding what to wear and they decide with instincts even they themselves are unaware of.  This instinct makes them want to dress that way.  But as soon as they leave the house they feel exposed and uncomfortable due to hiw revealing what they are wearing is.  The animal in them wants to attract men.  But their frontal lobe intelligence feels uncomfortable and hyper aware of people looking at their body.  From an evolutionary standpoint this behaviour is beneficial as while it does attract all men, and 99% of these men are unwanted, the 1% of men they are after will also be attracted.  In our society women choose.  So while she may feel uncomfortable dressed revealing her body, she will ultimately attracts the man she wants this way, rather than having some bloke chosen for her by her bothers or father for their own gain as happens in your culture.",4년 전,0,
@razakza," @tubestick00   Thank you for your response. The part where you answer my question, and where you speak from your cultural perspective, I appreciate. i don't understand why and how you feel brothers and fathers choose blokes for women in my culture. Is it perhaps through media perpetuation that you feel you can make that claim? In my culture, women have the final say on who their spouses will be. Fathers, brothers and others can make recommendations and introductions if they wish, but only the woman can say ""yes"" or ""no"". In fact, being coerced into a marriage is grounds for such a ""marriage"" to be declared null and void. Probably the most important condition for marriage in my culture, is that the woman has to be willing and approving.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@shintaromidorima493,"안녕하세요.   기존 금일 11/7 (토) 업로드 예정이었던 BLACKPINK - '24/365 with BLACKPINK' Last Episode 영상 유보하기로 결정되었습니다.  에버랜드 판다 관련 블랙핑크의 사육사 체험은 전문 수의사와 사육사들 참여 아래 철저한 방역 관리 및 위생 수칙을 지키며 진행되었습니다.  특히 블랙핑크는 아기 판다를 만났을 때 멤버 모두 위생장갑, 마스크와 보호복을 착용하였으며, 모든 장면 전환시마다 손, 신발 소독이 진행되었다는 점을 다시 한 번 말씀 드립니다.  그럼에도 '비전문가가 아기 판다와 밀접 접촉하는 행동은 또 다른 차원에서 오해를 불러일으킬 수 있다'는 판다 보전 전문가 분들의 권고와 국제 협력 관례를 존중하여 관련 영상의 상영은 유보하기로 하였습니다.  염려해주신 많은 분들께 감사드리며, 이번 촬영에 참여한 블랙핑크 및 판다에 대해 변함없는 관심과 애정을 부탁드립니다.",5년 전,0,

@DutchFurnace,"I once got a modelling gig for a big ad campaign of the Dutch Chamber of Commerce.  It was my first and only time, and didn't actually realize I was going to be modelling till I showed up. And although I'm not ugly, I'm not a model and certainly wasn't pursuing a modelling career so I was really surprised why I was there all day, having hundreds of pictures taken of me in all kinds of different outfits, while there were actual model people, and even a few semi ""famous"" commercial actors, coming and going for only a few quick pictures. I figured they were there for different jobs, or maybe just people having ""headshots"" taken to add to their picture portfolio. Like I said, I had no idea I was supposed to be modelling but after the day was over I let everyone know that I was going to be in a national ad campaign, although I knew nothing about the campaign itself.  A few months later I'm walking towards the university and I notice these huge billboards and recognize it as the pictures I took part in. And it turned out the gimmick of the ad was that simple children's puzzle game, where there's a head, a body, and feet of a profession, and they have to puzzle together for example the boots/pants of the fireman, with the coat of the fireman, with the helmet of the fireman. And the same for the construction worker, and the doctor, and the policeman, etc, etc. But then in the campaign they had jumbled up the professions to show for example the clogs/pants of the farmer, with the body of the policeman, with the head of the doctor, as a way to show solidarity or something like that. And only at this moment it dawned on me, that at the day of the shoot, I was never wearing any headgear to go with my outfit, and they the reverse. Anyway, if you haven't guessed it by now; they cut off my head, and just used me wearing all kinds of different coats and legs/boots to go with all the actual model and ""famous"" people heads. I never bothered to mention to anyone I was 66% of all those pictures.",5년 전,0,

Because time is endless and its likely that the events that are going to happen according to the guidestones have happened before maybe multiple times.

And these so called elites are very methodical with the way they do things to keep their hands clean, in fact they barely have to lift a finger so they arent 'responsible for the actual deaths. They use lies, half truths and manipulation to achieve their goals and have everybody kill eachother and themselves for them by any means necessary. People kill themselves every day, every minute for these people. By volunteering for political wars that they don't understand, being a victim of the orchestrated drug trafficking or gang warfare, alcoholism, rap and other music induced violence, Anyone who takes specific pharmaceuticals and vaccines which create illnessess, artificially produced diseases. They have the technology to wipe everyone off the face of the planet whenever they wish even solely through nuclear warfare, you know they have state of the art bunkers underground with enough resources to last centuries.

It was a (mainly) straight to DVD movie with him, Jessica Biel, Ray Liotta, Forest Whitaker, the great country singer songwriter Kris Kristofferson, Lisa Kudrow (from Friends) and Patrick Swayze in his last film role.  And Jennifer Lawrence is well...(drooling)...so down to earth in her interviews, a terrificly talented actress and freaking beautiful. I saw Winter's Bone shortly after it came out and have followed her career since. I don't know who played her father in that, but it was a great performance.  Graham Norton's show always came on BBC America right after Orphan Black so I'd always catch at least the beginning of it.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@tedcarruthers2677,"Both these guests are Jews....or more accurately crypto Jews.Crypto Jews conceal the fact they are Jews and are usually non religious.The Douglas family descended from Kirk Douglas are religious Jews and don't go out of their way to hide the fact they are Jews....Although Douglas was not Kirk Douglas real name.   Almost ALL top movie stars are Jews....MOST of whom hide the fact they are Jews.Hollywood is a very racist business with Jewish Hollywood producers refusing to hire European actors for roles....but this anti European discrimination is very well hidden....and since Jews control the media it will stay hidden.Minorities are given roles as a token gesture.....BUT very often they are usually at least half Jewish.   Drake the multimillionaire Black hip hop star is ACTUALLY a Jew and has had a barmitzvah.   Eddie Redmayne is a preposterous little worm who does not in the slightest deserve his fame....so logic would suggest he has serious connections within Jewry to get jobs.He may also have bizarre sexual leanings....this often helps in the cesspit known as Hollywood.   The actor who plays James Bond AND his wife are both Jews with influence...thus they are always playing roles in Jewish propaganda movies...like Inglorious Basterds....his wife appeared in a movie about an historian David Irving and some court case involving a Jewish academic Deborah Lipstadt.This movie like Schindlers List was about shoring up a failing jewish propaganda fable...the holocau$t....In many ""democracies""it is illegal to question this historical event.....primarily because the story is so full of inconsistencies and therefore open to debate.....well it would be if Jewish bankers didn't exercise indirect control over western govts.  May,Macron,Trump and Merkel are all crypto Jews like Eddie Redmayne.",6년 전,0,

We all act out or play a part  to an extent so it's human nature really. But I most certainly wouldn't call her very natural and 'real' over most  other hollywood types. I would see most in the same vain. However, In saying that, I would see Jennifer Connelly as far more 'real' but that's my opinion. Either way, the people who really impress me and who I really see as 'real' are doctors and nurses who volunteer fro Medicines san Frontires  or everyday women who become nurses or social care workers.

If she didn't deserve it, then she will be robbed sometime later in her career,it happens all the time. No one wins more than 2 or 3 usually, despite many deserving performances.",9년 전,2,
@nothingsuitsmelikeasuit4401,"BenDover It doesn't need to be explained really, it depends on what connects with each person. She probably just does nothing for you as a viewer which is more than fine. I personally feel her performance in Silver Linings was the best among the line up in that year (2012). The range of emotions displayed in it was just amazing to watch, it's a performance that you have to pay attention to its details to truly admire more imo,  and this is coming from someone who thought Chastain was deserving of a win at first, only after I saw Lawrence's film finally later on that I realized what a great talent and versatile actress she is and  (especially when I realized that she's the girl from winter's bone in which she played a totally different character). She's a truly unique talent, and for her age, she still has so much in store when it comes to improving and playing different roles.",9년 전,2,
@thomas9451,"BenDover I strongly disagree and thought she gave one of the best performances in recent memory, her role in SLP elevates the whole movie and it stayed with me the most. Another role I think she should have an Oscar for is Winter's Bone. Great actress and she is only 25.",9년 전,2,
