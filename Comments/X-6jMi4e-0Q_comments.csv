The frame is rigged, you have 2 of the same drawing one on a rolling sheet, and the other behind on a path leading to a shredder.

@tikkelbikkel,"JB's tattoo is shit man. Like for someone with his success, surely he could put both the time and money in to get quality tattoos. The arm is left crooked, the other arm is blended into the body, the shading is bad and unnecessary to begin with since it's mostly solid black, the face and hair is unrecognizable, also the dress is rounded off where it's supposed to be more pointy. I'm not surprised that Banksy wasn't impressed by it. There's a significant lack of detail, which is remarkable when you're getting a copy of something. It's been some time since he's gotten that though, so I genuinely hope he has already realized this and covered it up with something good.",5년 전,0,

@nunyabiznez6381,"Art isn't purchased because it is art so much as because it is a rare collectible.   The desirability comes from the artist's fame more than from it's visual achievement.   99.999999% of the population, rich or poor, educated or not educated hasn't a clue what art is or isn't.  They don't know good art from bad.   But they want to be seen as sophisticated so they buy art.  To make sure they buy good art that will impress their equally ignorant friends, relatives and neighbors, they buy something from someone famous.  If they are exceedingly wealthy they pay an exorbitant price for it and make sure their friends, relatives and neighbored know how much they paid.  ""I paid a million dollars for this Jackson Pollock sounds impressive to someone who has no clue who Jackson Pollock is but then googles them and find's the Wikipedia article about him and then they are impressed knowing that some Jackson Pollocks can be had for considerably less so they think their friend/relative/neighbor obtained a particularly wonderful Jackson Pollock since they paid more than the others are worth.   So they are impressed and impressing your friends, neighbors and relatives is the point to most wealthy people.  Because if you merely wanted that pretty image on your wall you can go on line and buy a high quality reproduction for a few dollars and have it framed in a pretty frame for $300 or so and make your wall just as nice but it's not about making your wall nice it's about impressing your friends neighbors and relatives.",6년 전,0,

If he didn't like his work being touted in the way it is and it was just for everyone , he would have ensured  the shredder worked or he would try again. AS far as I can see, his work , no matter what the intention, brings out the worst in people . When his work appears on a wall or door etc, people try to remove the wall or steal the door etc to get it for themselves and sell it.  I'm not familiar with where he has put his work but If he's wants the general  public to it,  then why doesn't he paint something on a Police station , (there's a real challenge.) Or on a Town Hall. Then everyone gets to enjoy it. Although councils being what they are, they would either paint it over immediately because they didn't realise what it was , or sell it to make up the year's budget deficit. it seems as if Banksy's original intentions have been thwarted.",6년 전,0,

,"Back passage Turn around time is based on the amount of time that help take to grow wealthy enough on wages, and indispensable enough to be offered associate positions.   Or baring that (where contracts of employment are even less equitable), then things comes down to amount of time it takes for help to pilfer and smuggle enough silverware out from contracted estates, to furnish own homes and attend to own dreams (versus fulfilling other peoples).  Especially when conditions become increasingly sparse, even as disgruntlement only builds and builds (compounded by late pay checks and other peeves)  When signs point to this inevitable shifting of tides (sometimes taking centuries. Imagine the number of gobs of spit secretly laid into meals in that time!)  One counter strategy is to accelerate this natural decline of conditions by encouraging chaos and ruin, so that when transfers, buy outs or takeovers do occur  Especially by the time equities and mergers are already in the horizon or have been entered into,   So that buy the time former subordinates reach key points in organizations, all they have waiting for them is a giant sink hole that only sucks up resources.  This is why spite, grudge, malice, envy should never fuel any ventures or undertakings. Although some people may insist, this is what Europeans should have been told a long time ago.  So a little too late for that now, as what goes around comes around? Surely even if this may have been the case, centuries ago,   The long trek into modernity (at the expense of West establishing itself as center of the World, in which all things flowed into) would have helped most of us come around by now no?  Maybe not, if another Western terrible infant is being unleashed into the world, just as Asia has finally righted itself up, with an increasingly vibrant art market  While the larger issue of lowering skill sets, as creative energies are diverted into social commentary or even politics, also does arise.  When certain parts of the world may not have the right infrastructure in place, to benefit (positively metabolize such stimulation/agitation)   Art as political agit propaganda and market destabilization force, is a path Western art has been taking for the past 120 years at least anyway  And Banksy apparently does meet the requisite of amusing, entertaining, provoking, while making works that are accessible and easily palatable  As disposable as cash money some would say. Something that the Western art market has known for at least 100 years also yes?  Time is no longer worth or rather is no longer valued (distributed and balanced ) in the same way as it used to be surely.  But are artists as pawns in a game of political maneuvering and financial marketing any better off  then they ever were today?  (as muses and inspiration, guinea pigs and lab rats, compass needles and saile to technological innovation, market activity, and social formation  (back in the days when Michelangelo  was being ridden by popes to forward religious agendas  Or back in more recent time when penniless and distraught Dutch artists were killing themselves,   to add to mythos that could then be cashed in on, only a hundred years later? At the point where he originally drew inspiration from no less  - The East  So I for one say, ""Let Banksy Be""?

The girl (people) is (are) reaching (hope/hoping) out for the balloon (love (and heart)) as the wind (change) pushes it away. So, people are hoping, reaching-out for love as the change around them seems to push it ever-farther from grasp. The reaching can, of course, be both physical and non-physical in nature. One can reach-out physically to those near them and one can reach-out via the heart with yearning for, in this case, love. Also, then, people are yearning for love. The heart(s) of the people are yearning for something which seems, in present times, to be just out of reach. I see it as another expression, even a reminder, that as the world grows smaller around us each day, as we have, and are, becoming more separated. With extreme self-indulgence (in ""modern"" societies) ever apparent today, the modalities used, and the types of interactions had, are inarguably less-connected than the more traditional forms. Of course, any major change has its period of chaos until a majority foothold is once more established, as smaller changes bring about a more comfortable resting place - until the next major social change occurs. I can also see it as, because of the aforementioned 'disconnected-ness', the people are yearning and reaching-out for love and, as change continues to occur, presently seems just out-of-reach, as we move closer together once more, tired of living so close, yet so far from one another. As well, I see simple piece of art which adequately defines a large part of the manifested human experience. Whether it seems to you the balloon is almost within grasp, or just out of, the underlying message is clear: we decide. We decide where change takes us, because we are not limited only to instinct. We decide how we respond to what we see in the world and how we inspire others to see it as well. The world needs free-thinking people that are not subject to social norms to be the change that we want to see. So, yes, the balloon can be both far and near. This is not to speak to the ""optimism"" and ""pessimism"" mindsets of categorical understanding which seems to not leave room for the marriage of the two. There exists an understanding that the physical manifestation of this plane of our [physical] existence harbors both light and dark - and that each aspect is resident within us all. What does our expression show the world? How do we respond to the change? How can we influence the change for the better? We decide  Of course, it could also be as simple as a little girl who loved her balloon eventually lost her dear inanimate friend to the wind.",6년 전,0,

@lesterdarke,"Just wanted to clarify something that was slightly misleading. Artworks sold in the EU including the UK within which this auction took place are subject to Artist's Resale Right, whereby when any artwork is resold the artists is entitled to royalties. So that artists who sold work for pennies when they had no name as such can benefit from the success of their work when it later becomes inflated in resales. This isn't the case in the US, but it is worth noting that Artists aren't completely alienated from resales. Furthermore, artists with such an established name as Banksy as you have briefly mentioned can offer authentication of their artworks or even sell them with contracts stipulating image rights and reselling stipulations. So whilst Banksy certainly does have a fraught relationship with the art market he is in many ways more privileged than most artists engaging with the market.",6년 전,0,

How does an attached blade suddenly turn 90 degrees to make the cuts?  It doesn't.   What would make more sense is that he had 2 of them in the frame.   One is pre shredded.  The remote activated a roller mechanism that fed the real picture back into the case and of the other fed out the pre shredded copy.    If you look at :26 and freeze it you see the blades.

@idiotsloveboxes,"Banksy is very talented. Period. The way he chooses to use his talents I think is limiting him. Banksy’s general cynicism is really holding him back. I’ve been following Banksy’s works for years. You notice the repeated motifs & messages & variations on a theme. That’s fine & normal to a point, but after a while his pieces blend together so much that whatever point he wants to make gets muddled. So instead of audiences pondering some institutional criticism about society, it’s “Oh look a Banksy piece. That’s my screensaver.” After a while all his messages just read “You suck you suck you suck” no matter what country or context they’re in. I very much loved the documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop, but the last five minutes stand out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of the film. He takes us on this 90 minute journey to get to know this guy Mr Brainwash. MBW has a gallery show in the end where visitors say they love the pieces & I like what I’m seeing on screen. We’re all happy. Then Banksy feels the need to speak directly to the camera about how terrible this is & the most extremely vague & confusing criticism of Mr Brainwash for reasons I still don’t understand. And then credits roll. That left a bad aftertaste to an otherwise superb & informative film. Why did he feel the need to do that? I think Banksy just needs to remember why he chose this life to begin with. Find new ways to communicate a message. Not all of the world’s problems can be solved with a middle finger.",6년 전,0,

The other problem is that even if I could ask him, Banksy would stick to his story of what happened, even if it was staged.

@starchington,"I am so tired of this stuff on this channel.   Art to this channel is mostly post-modern philosophical pseudo-art more than actual objects or craftwork.  (Yes art is not alway tangible things but it also is.)  It is in fact easy to imagine this kind of kitschy, popular, vaguely thought provoking stuff as work, which makes it not at all challenging.  Why not instead focus on actually challenging work? Instead of work that ironically put everyday objects on display, why not examine genuinely everyday objects?  Sarcophagi, metals, materials, furniture, clothes, manuscripts, allegory, myth, rhythm, tropes, techineque--all things we could be talking about instead of jokes that are funny for one day like this and Hirst's and Koons.  Who cares? You go on and on about how the culturati of these auction houses control the art world and how thats unjust.  Well you, Art Assignment, have a huge platform to promote lesser known artists, movements, or historical moments so do that!  Show me the objects or stories that individuals love, why they love them, and how these works effect work.  Point to the hidden gems, the details, the trends through history not just ""Anything can be art.""  We know anything can so give me something I haven't seen before not something everyone has thought of before it's even happened.  Be the Criterion Collection of art not the freshman dorm room poster of art.     ""I don't think there's ever been such a rush towards insignificance in the name of the historical future as we've seen in the last fifteen years.  The famous radicalism of 60s and 70s art turns out to have been kind of dumb show, a charade of toughness, a way of avoiding feeling.  And I don't think we are ever again obliged to look at a plywood box or a row of bricks on the floor or a videotape of some twit from the University of Central Paranoia sticking pins in himself and think, 'This is the real thing. This is the necessary art of our time.  This needs respect.'  Because it isn't and it doesn't and nobody cares.  The fact of the matter is anybody except a child could make such things because children have the kind of direct, sensuous, and complex relationship with the world around them, that modernism in its declining years, was trying to deny.  That relationship is the lost paradise art wants to give back to us, not as children but as adults...  The basic project of art is always to make the world whole and comprehensible,  to restore it to us in all its glory and occasional nastiness not through argument but through feeling and then to close the gap between you and everything that is not you and in this way to pass from feeling to meaning.  Its not something committees can do. It's not a task achieved by groups or by movements.  Its done by individuals, each person mediating between a sense of history and experience of the world.""    --Robert Hughes",6년 전,15,
@adnanilyas6368,"I really dislike the whole movement around Banksy. By stenciling, he completely streamlines the difficult process of forming tight shapes with spray cans. His works tend to be limited in color. While they feature political commentary, it is not particularly nuanced, sharp, or deep commentary. His works seem to say exactly one thing, with limited range of interpretation. The positions themselves are not pushing many envelopes — they tend to be the same leftish politics that are blandly supported by the educated professional classes or cultured elites, the sorts of hypothetically influential people who fail to take any kind of real effort to implement lasting change for fear of losing their own status in society. The people who apparently are his target audience (and his buyers.) He is not on the frontline for such causes. Banksy comes to them once they have already gotten a large degree of public support (the Syrian Girl with Balloon piece represents exactly that.) And all of it is tinged with this sort of witty irony, like the whole point is to say ""Yeah, I really got you there, didn't I?"". The sort of witty irony that edgy teenagers adulate, but eventually mostly grow out of. And then there's the whole media frenzy around it. I happen to like well crafted and clever graffiti. But the vast majority of such works don't go in museums (as they should not). And yet, you have Banksy scoring irony points for destroying a piece that sold for absurd amounts of money (while simultaneously crafting a piece that will make several times more thanks to the media hoopla), while those artists who got paid to spray paint the set of Homeland and snuck in a message calling the show racist have largely been forgotten.",6년 전,18,

Two, the painting was originally done on the material magicians make those handkerchiefs out of and sold with no frame. Once it’s been sold, the auctioneer, who’s in on it, holds the piece, lights it on fire as it disappears in seconds.

They don't depict the actual creation process and possibly not the actual frame. They are a deliberate joke. Whether he claims they were made in 2006? I don't remember. He claimed that the frame was prepared in 2006 to fire one day when the painting goes to auction, and the videos are suggested by association to show the process of its creation. Chances are, no public information released about the ordeal is exactly the truth. Was the frame made in 2018? We don't know, we never will. Doesn't actually matter all that much.

@MCAndyT,"Sigh. This is the big question... Debord tried to answer it, but like so many provocative ideas from the '60's it just kinda fizzled out. Capitalism is not just an economical model it is a fierce hegemonic culture. Buuut, I do believe that commodities predate Capital and that we need to be ok with the idea that commodities will continue well into ""the revolution"". Along those lines, I can't help but think about Mierle Laderman Ukeles's Maintenance Art Manifesto: ""...After the revolution, who's going to pick up the garbage?""",6년 전(수정됨),1,
@FelonyArson,"​ @MCAndyT   Yes. I think that some things we considere commodity will continue to exist, but the a lot of the negative implications and the fact that under capitalism a lot of things (and beings) are commodified will disappear. The important thing a revolution would have to achive is giving people control over the commodity instead of the commodity having control over people. I also once theorized that a post capitalist society will have ""trading clubs"" were people can live out the thrill of accumulating a currency without it having serious effects on lives (like the in-game currency of video games). In general I think a post capitlist society would elevate gaming to a new level of importance for that society, as the urge for competition has to go somewhere.  On Maintenance: I think the most important thing is to not have people alienated and bored! (Boredom is always counter-revolutionary -Guy Debord  :D )  - One way to make mundane tasks interesting is seeing the effect you have on your enviroment,  so the kind of mass production assembly line is not really suitable (for humans, thankfully we could automate a lot of tasks!) Recognition is another thing that would help against alienation! (in a egalitarian society there will be loads of recognition, promised ;D )  - Another measure would be reducing the time people do Maintenance work, this could be achieved trough splitting the task up (more hands make light work), automation, or designing things in a way that requires less maintenance (e.g. using less packaging in order to reduce trash)  - The last important part would be to make Maintenance interesting, we could incorporate a lot of game design tricks to make Maintenance  interesting!

@MissLilyputt,"AngelHQ I think it would be difficult for him to talk about the importance of intellectual property when he has defaced real property to make his “art”. There are dozens if not hundreds of people who graffiti all sorts of things in all sorts of places and rarely with explicit or implicit consent. If he actually wanted to have that conversation then he would use a medium that doesn’t deface property that he doesn’t have permission to use. If he insists on doing this he should expect someone to try to steal it. There are ways he can have his art be free but still his and it all starts with where he chooses to paint. what I believe, is that this painting shredding stunt was purposeful but not for some deeper meaning. His art has always been considered “edgy” and what is more edgy than destroying it after its sold but in such a way that it still has all its parts and seeing the shenanigans he was up to with his art in the past this is just more proof that he doesn’t consider his art to be all that precious or important.

@titanium2295,of*,6년 전,0,
@brodersami," @titanium2295  If there's one thing I dislike more than people who say that art has to be beautiful and that abstract/conceptual art isn't ""real"" art, it's when people say that ""realistic"" art is all surface level and carries no deeper meaning. Traditional painting à la the old masters is often imbued with a ton of symbolism and meaning, and as such invites deeper contemplation of the piece. That said, I don't believe that great art has to have some deep imbued message to be effective. A lot of art simply captures a fleeting moment, a personal experience, something emotional that doesn't ask the viewer to decipher it, only to experience and relate to it. Some of it just tries to convey an emotion through abstract shapes. The point is that I'm a human, and I mainly see art as an expression of the artist's (and/or subject's) humanity, which I can relate to on a deeper level. That's why I would consider Banksy's art more surface level, as it states its whole message outright and the message is the whole experience. A lot of what he's saying with his art has already been said, and with more nuance, in books like 1984 and Brave New World. His pieces can often be summed up with a sentence or two (but that's not necessarily a bad thing, as I will explain).  I don't think that Banksy's art isn't art, and I don't think it's ""bad"" per se, only that I wouldn't consider it ""fine"" art worthy of such ridiculous scrutiny, praise, and money, and I would think that Banksy himself would agree considering he has pieces stating things like ""I can't believe you morons actually buy this shit"". It's very effective graffiti art, and makes good use of straightforward symbolism. He's an incredibly talented ""propaganda"" artist, but as soon as you put his art in a gallery rather than on the street it loses all its magic.  There's been a lot of goal post moving in these comments, saying that Banksy is ""relevant"", saying that no other artist is as good at social commentary, asking me to provide examples of artists that I think are better in some specific aspect. My whole point is that these things aren't markers of great art. Art is not propaganda, and its quality should not be measured by how effective it is as such. This is why it feels like people who value this art so highly are neglecting a large part of what makes art ""art"".   To end, I will state what I thought didn't need to be stated (but apparently does), that this is my opinion. Also, I don't think people are dumb and can't read deeper into art (though I believe many can be quite dismissive of things that aren't immediately clear). All I'm saying is that I'm tired of this kind of simplistic art being lifted up as ""genius"" when it simply isn't. I will not be making another comment in this thread as this one has taken up quite enough time and I'm trying to cut down on the time I spend on the internet. I just felt compelled to make some sort of statement because of some of the ridiculous things being said in these comments (from both people defending and attacking Banksy).",6년 전,6,

Anything and everything can be art, no matter how crude or simplistic, as long as someone with money can back-fill ""meaning"" behind it. A half-shredded painting is more valuable than the same intact painting. People buy a painting which literally says ""I can't believe people buy this shit."" A pile of bricks on the ground is considered ""art"" because I don't even remember the contrived reason. It reeks of a decadent culture trying to ascribe value and meaning to novelty while all but completely disregarding merit as unimportant. It's a show of profound lack of self-awareness.  Honestly, I'm not pissed at Banksy for cashing in on it. Far as I'm concerned, getting rich off of other people's decadence with deliberately subversive work is the best kind of satire there is. Push the envelope, see how lazy and deliberately offensive you can be and still sell your work. Push the market into a bubble and wait for it to burst. If it does, great! Satire achieved.

(Here again, reaching a lot of people isn't in it self a bad trait, but to reach a broader audience [mainstream], you have to dumb down on every intellectual aspect to make it more easier to understand and get).   The same can be said about movies: Movies which are popular nowadays are not because of its ingenuity, but because its a mainstream spectacle. If we consider great old movies (Im personally a fan of Blade Runner, but you can insert any movie with a focus on something which isn't just spectacle), they were never loved by masses nor commercially successful.",6년 전(수정됨),0,
