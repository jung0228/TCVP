@ajdeboyar3754,"I wonder how can ppl be so dumb to think Westbrick is better than Steph. Let's be real guys,any team will take Steph over Russ to start an Franchise.  Accept,the fact that Westbrick makes teammates worse and Steph makes his teammates better. Since,KD joined the Warriors he has been playing the best Basketball we've ever seen him play. B4 He wasn't in the conversation of the best player. LeBron was way above him.  KD has also improved as an Defender and Passer, which would have never happened had he continued to play with Russ . Ibaka was an defensive player of the year and 2 times leading shot blocker when KD was the one leading the team back in early 2010's to 2014. KD's MVP year Russ was injured and Ibaka was the 2nd best player in OKC he was doing it on both ends. His defense was great as ever and he had improved a lot and was very good in offense. KD was feeding him good buckets.  Serge's mid-court shooting was also very good. It's a shame, to see my favourite team's players are now all separated and are playing for different teams. KD and iBlocka were my fav duo to watch back in the days. Only, bcos of Westbrick and the OKC organisation who decided to make Westbrick lead the team. Now ""Oklahoma City Thunder's""name should be ""Chokelahoma Shitty Blunder"".",6년 전,0,
@ajdeboyar3754,"Definitely,the greatest shooter ever but what makes him an treat to watch is his ball handling skills,making plays smooth passing and desire to be the best and sharing the limelight despite being an superstar and the only unanimous MVP ever. His abilities of driving to the basket despite his less strength and height compared to other PG 's. He's gonna be top 2 PG ever. He is definitely one of the best PG in today's game along with Kyrie and Harden based on their forms it's an 3 way race.Others don't even come close especially Westbrick who only knows how to statpad and makes his teammates worse it's good that KD left OKC and got rid of playing with Westbrick and Iam happy for Me7o too watch out guys this year Melo's game is gonna be thrice as good as it was last season playing with that low IQ ball hog Stat padder Mental Westbrick. Rockets shouldn't be taken for granted by Warriors. only if one of the team was in the East we would have been blessed to watch an epic Finals game it's a shame that Western Conference Finals will be the real Finals . No team from East is gonna win an 7 game series against either of both Houston or Golden State. Maybe Boston will give little bit competition but won't win more than 2 games because their two all stars(Kyrie and Gordon) haven't played toghether so they will need time to find that rhythm and chemistry to be deadly playing toghether.",6년 전,0,
