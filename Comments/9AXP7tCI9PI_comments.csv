@SwarmerBees,"Deep learning techniques can amplify blind spots, and does not engage in critical thinking.   For example, the engine was asked to summarize a blog post.  Summarization has different levels of quality.   Consider what would be expected to summarize 10 pages of code.  Any lead is going to expect one of his developers to quickly summarize what his code is doing.  Now consider a broad domain case to flesh out the complicated issues involved in a good summary.  Consider a cliff notes summary conveying what a political or philosophical work is about.  Firstly, the summarization narrative is tricky because different audiences will summarize what a work is about in very different ways.   It would be a bad summary if they did not relate what the main ideas are from various competing perspectives.  But Chat GPT doesn't really understand the article.   In the case of the blog post on Biden, ChatGPT merely compressed the article but did not perform even a rudimentary summary of what was going on in the article.  For example it does not note that the author consistently cites multiple examples which casts the subject of the article in a particular light consistent with a particular point of view.  This piece was politically conservative, but my point would be identical if the post were more liberal.  The summarization questions are the same.  Were the examples dubious or not?   Was there selective focus- Did the account heavily weight one particular set of examples over another?  How would that weighting be summarized?  Were the stated facts accurate?   For example, in the one used, the author proposed that it was uncommon for foreign dignitaries to utter the phrase God save the Queen when in fact it every foreign dignitary attending a diplomatic dinner in the UK has uttered it as a customary toast.  The article further proposes that gaffes (such as using queen instead of king) are unusual for Biden.   Now, the app could in principle provide guidance to the ChatGPT engine in order to make a structural analysis of the claims made in a body of text in order to better summarize it, but this would be tedious and the better approach is for the quality of the machine learning engine itself to be upgraded in some fundamental ways.    I have seen examples of ChatGPT writing C# code which can't compile because it writes lines that violate its own class declarations.   That's a pretty significant anomaly, so the ability to perform even far more rudimentary sanity checks requires further refinement.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@RunningBugs,"So after digging into the code, I found that Langchain is actually doing the following things: 1. for all your data, store then in vector storage using embeddings; 2. when you query something, it first did a similarity search in the embeddings database, and find out the files that's related to your question; 3. After finding the related files, it takes all the text of that file, together with a context message: ""Use the following pieces of context as the 1st system message to answer the user's question. \nIf you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.\n----------------\n {your text data}"".  This somehow tells us these points:  1. why it's sometimes not having outside world's information? If the question you asked is not in your document, or if it's not trained on the data for your question, it will return nothing valuable as instructed.   2. Is there a limit on the sizes of your data? Yes, you can't use it with super large files because it's doing a document filtering and it will send all text related to the API server, recently the gpt-3.5-turbo-16k might be the good model to use and it's best the total size of related docs is less than 16k tokens. Which means the best practice would be grouping your data into different topics and try to ensure any query, if responded with similarity search, the total size of returned document is not exceeding the token size limit of the model.  I think16k is roughly the size of a 13-15 pages paper.   3. By removing/changing the system message, you might get better results for common sense questions. I really don't like the system messaged by default, since in a playground, asking gpt-3.5-turbo-16k ""Who is George Washington?"" will give you better answers comparing to the langchain solution with an empty system message.  4. The langchain is using unstructured library (it reports errors when I didn't install it), which means you can not only use txt files, but also pdf files, word files, etc. Haven't tested it out but highly likely support query of multiple pdf files using similar code in the video. So you can put multiple pdfs in a folder, using a directory index creator and ask questions for your papers, I think (haven't tested it out)  5. The langchain not only supports ChatGPT models, but also other models in the chat_models package. Google PALM2 chat is also supported as of Jul 10, 2023, if someone has the key, you can use other models too. While I don't think PALM2 has the common sense knowledge as good as ChatGPT, but I think it is a better language generating model comparing to at least gpt-3.5-turbo-16k , so PALM2 may produce better results on your data and OpenAI's models are better in answering common sense questions after changing the default system message. OpenAI said general access to gpt-4 is starting, and people with history of successful payment using OpenAI API will get the access immediately a few days ago. The access to new developers will be rolled out until end of July.  Also I think it's quite cool to be able to use your own data, if you want to create something like an AI assistant, you can always use code to collect current time, user information and put those in a folder, so the assistant will be able to do much more than current ones. Another very cool thing is auto-gpt which works great using gpt-4, gpt-3.5 is not smart enough and behaves much worse than gpt-4. If you asked auto-gpt something, it will be able to google itself and replied with the real time information. Also the example of auto-gpt is cool telling you how it could create a recipe based on the next holiday. Hopefully the access to gpt-4 is coming sooner.",2년 전,102,

@DanielLoureiro82,"Unfortunately not. A problem with the LangChain approach, is that ChatGPT has a limit of 4k-32k tokens (depends on the model) for each conversation. This is about 5k-40k- pages, which is okay for small datasets, but it doesn't work well if you have to cramp huge datasets into the chat message. That's why it doesn't work well with entire codebases, for example.  There are two main technique to deal with the ChatGPT token limitation, both covered on OpenAI's cookbooks.   The first technique is the ""fine-tuning"". Here you use your own data to train your custom and private model. Using OpenAI's API, you provide a list of inputs and their expected outputs. Once it is finished, you can access the custom model as any other model via their API. The downside: it's expensive and it is not the best if you need to constantly input new data.  The second technique is called ""Question answering using embeddings-based search"". OpenAI has a tutorial on their GitHub with the same title. This is the technique used on LangChain. Here, you use OpenAI's API to convert a text into an embedding. An embedding is a vector distance: it is an array of floats that represents the semantical distance of something (like a word, a word fragment, a whole sentence, audio, etc), to another something. Here, you can think of an embedding as a hash: you input some content and it returns a sequence of numbers. The returned embedding is always the same for the same input and model. Back to the technique, after converting each document into an embedding, you store them in the local storage for later usage. Then, when you want to ask something to ChatGPT, you convert the question into an embedding (using OpenAI API) and use this value to get the closest documents to the question's embedding (""closest"" as in the mathematics' matrices). After all of this, you write your ChatGPT question: you fill the question string with all of your local documents sorted by proximity to the question until the token limit. Then, you prepend your actual question followed by the instructions (ex. ""{question} Use the following data to answer the question: {documents}""). You trim the excedent tokens at the end and send to chatgpt.  While this works well for your emails or small snippets of data, it won't work amazingly well for large datasets that have too much dependency on each other. That's why the Twitter example works well for simple questions about the code, but it doesn't perform good for anything that requires to know many parts of codebase at once.",2년 전,0,

@atanasdoychinov6491,The ChatGPT API has 2 ways how to add data. First is named embeddings using your own database where you have your privacy.

@gunreddy,"That's not exactly right.  First of all, finetuning a LLM like ChatGPT isn't the best way to adapt it to your own data. Finetuning is best if you want it to perform a specific task or series of tasks, like if you want to have a pipeline where ChatGPT performs text generation then some specific analysis, etc. Finetuning isn't the best approach if you want to just give ChatGPT extra knowledge through documents (OpenAI say the same thing btw). Finetuning is a costlier approach in terms of price and resources, and doing that just to have ChatGPT know your calendar is overkill.  If you're using embeddings, you're not exactly 'adding' data. You're still sending those vector embeddings along with the prompt.  Right now you can't finetune GPT-4.",2년 전,0,

This can be done inside or outside court. This can be done in language learning for example. Grammar is merely rules for conveying meaning. You just need to learn when it is appropriate to use what grammatical form in a given situation - to declare, ask, contradict, agree, predict etc. and when speaking to a given person - eg a superior, peer or subordinate. With this framework, you can then proceed to find the rules, practice them and then master the general area of knowledge. This is lawyering and no machine can do this yet. And even if they can - why be dependent on a machine? Isn’t it lame to use Google Translate when travelling to a foreign land or reading a foreign language book? Yes. Some things can be automated, but there is always satisfaction from learning to do it yourself.",2년 전,1,

@Brainbuster,"​ @MacroAnarchy  Yes, but the bright side is, all your rivals will be rendered obsolete.  We used to say jobs like law were among those which would never be automated. Now we begin to see that artists, designers, architects, radiologists (and soon doctors no doubt), bloggers (90% of their work), and even are being automated.  Even learning a computer language will be an exercise in futility, by the end of this year. That's what everyone said should be your escape hatch, in case of total automation.  My prediction:  This is good news, if you think about what must happen down the line.  Suppose, hypothetically, ALL jobs are automated.  Nobody pays lawyers. You don't earn money.  But YOU don't pay your doctor. You don't pay your Uber driver. Like lawyers, doctors and drivers are now automated — no humans needed (humans make too many errors).  And for anyone who says, ""I want a doctor with a bedside manner,"" I will take the doctor who has read a million medical books (if there are that many).  I'll take the doctor who is up to date with the latest studies, and has memorized every medical journal published up till yesterday.  Bedside manner is nice, but doctors don't charge extra for that. The highest paid ones are the most proficient. And soon, AI will outperform the most proficient doctors/surgeons/lawyers/drivers/bloggers/candlestick makers.  In the future, you don't pay for the clerk ringing you up / bagging your groceries. Robots do it better.  And sure, robots are expensive. But calculators used to be expensive. Now, calculators are so cheap we might toss them in the trash. So competent robots will get cheaper.  And those who program the robots will get cheaper. It's so much easier to code now, I've ""written"" code I needed (after many conversations with GPT about what I need), and I stopped paying for several monthly services which I had been paying for. I'm just a magician (I don't know computer code).  In the future, you don't ""earn"" an income. That would be silly. What could you possibly do better than a computer?  BUT...  You don't need money because everyone else's job is automated.  So nobody is charging you money for their services.  Therefore everything is as cheap as dirt.  Everything will be so cheap, nobody will sweat over law books with the goal to earn a good living.   A hundred years ago, my corresponding with you would've been VERY costly. I would've had to buy paper and pen, and ink. Written a letter (no backspace). Hired a horseman, and the horseman delivers my letter to you days or weeks later.  Now I can send you all these words virtually free. I can send you a book for free. I can probably find the 100 best law books, then send you copies by sundown.  A hundred years ago, people paid a small fortune for a set of encyclopedias. And now nobody would pay for encyclopedias (because now, everyone has a set of encyclopedias in our pocket, and a calculator, and a stop watch, etc.).  So, eventually, when doctoring and lawyering and truckdriving are abundant, money will be pretty much obsolete.  If my prediction is correct, then we will either have a UBI, or no money at all, or the human oligarchs will enslave all of us.  Even if you complete your law degree, it won't be a total waste. You'd still be a better conversationalist than most (just try not to argue too much).",2년 전(수정됨),0,

Artists: Jobs that involve creativity, emotion, and personal expression, such as painters, musicians, and writers. 2. Therapists and Counselors: Roles that require empathy, emotional understanding, and human connection in fields like therapy and counseling. 3. Teachers: Educators who provide personalized instruction, guidance, and mentorship to students. 4.

Creative Directors: Professionals who oversee and guide creative processes in industries like advertising, design, and marketing. 10.

@MinisterHenry-jc3vk,It's worse than that start looking into the chord of inherent jurisdiction a parallel legal system within Canada United States and most of the United Kingdom. The Bible is the top law in the country. People just don't know how to enter into a different jurisdiction and once you do you'll realize you don't need a lawyer at all. You fall into common law. All the hundreds of laws in enactments do not apply to a Christian man or woman. They only have jurisdiction over you because you're using a last name given to you by the state and it's not given to you by your family and that's the mistake. When you take on the name of the corporation you're actually consenting to fall under the rules and regulations of civil law. Now at least you'll understand why the real families do not use their last name and the queen and king of England are from the house of Windsor. You don't call them Charles Windsor you actually call him Charles from the house of Windsor that is a clear distinction between a man and a person persons are non-believers and Christ and fall under secular law.

@MinisterHenry-jc3vk," @MacroAnarchy  if you believe what you write then you must also look into maxims of law. They are based on previous cases and are the fundamental Foundation of today's law. One maximum paraphrased if there is a conflict between old law and new law the older law supersedes it. The Bible was there before there was civil law it is the foundation of civil law. Civil law only applies if you've accepted with your consent. Show me in your civil law where court has the jurisdiction to force you to commit blasphemy sending you to hell. The original such law because the powers of civil law are limited. When you learn that limitation you'll understand better. When you ask AI about specific passages of the Bible it has a programmed misconception and misunderstanding of the teachings oh God. I believe this to be deliberate so that you can never find your exit from civil and doctrination and slavery.  A real simple one where it says give to Caesar what is Caesar's. If God previously gave you the Dominion of the Earth. Then Caesar has nothing so give him nothing. Civil Society wants you to think you are obligated to give tax and God never said that as you can see here in this case. If the Bible is the foundation of the constitution in civil law It also says that man will not add or take away from God's laws. Apart from willfully accepting civil law as having authority over you. Clearly it is in opposition to gods foundational laws and has no standing. A lawyer cannot argue a case using the Bible because he's prohibited by the Law Society and as a member he has to work within civil law framework. AI is also working within civil law framework. Maybe start asking AI about the court of inherent jurisdiction and you will see that it knows almost nothing. Maybe before calling it gibberish why don't you ask AI this question "" what is the procedural difference between a civil court and a court of inherent jurisdiction?"" You have a tool right there in front of you that you promote is being so powerful and yet you could call what I say is gibberish without confirming it with your Authority being AI.

You will succeed in an area that you've never expected even if you can't be a lawyer. It's not an end it's a beginning. I'm in my mid 60s I've seen this over and over again.,1년 전(수정됨),0,
@MinisterHenry-jc3vk, @TheCinematicGamer  one more point Sorry to spam you. The fact that you're learning law and learning AI you'll be able to outperform any of those old fogies in their 50s and older and have the potential of being the better lawyer. Learn this stuff as much as you can suck it up all the technology you can and you'll always be okay. I'm in my mid 60s I was a professor in civil and mechanical engineering and I'm back in school learning more. I'm actually a student at MIT learning AI through correspondence.,1년 전(수정됨),0,
@MinisterHenry-jc3vk, @TheCinematicGamer  I'm sure if you ask for regulation they will regulate it so that you can't get ahead and the people who are connected to the party will be more than happy to take that spot a job working for them again. AI is your ticket to freedom. You're already a mouse in a trap. Have they ever told you that you don't have to pay income tax. You probably don't know this because you've been too hard working. Under the United Nations human rights the international Covenant of civil and political rights to which the United States Canada and hundreds of other countries are part of list taxes as voluntary and you have a right to not pay tax into not belong to any sector of society. Now you can use AI to look at your true rights that are enshrined not in the Constitution but in King James Bible 1611 which is the foundation document for the Constitution of the United States and you'll find that the constitution took rights away from you that you already had because you say that you're a citizen you're a person in actual fact you neither one of those those are fictions you're actually a man or a woman in accordance to God's law which is superior over all law maybe you can use AI to realize that even property tax is voluntary and they made you a part of a corporation as a officer and that's why they gave you the obligation to pay property tax for that right that you could have just simply turned down. It just simply not enough time to realize how we been screwed over because we're too busy working.,1년 전(수정됨),0,
@jamesfisherman7669,"No, the Lawyers will always be there bec robots cannot legally file a case, argue it before the court and appeal if it loses! And very basic - you need a human to pass the bar😀 The same is true for all professionals with license to practice. AI is an expanded Google search and it will be a great tool but cannot totally replace the workforce specially disciplines where license is needed to practice🤔",1년 전,0,
@MacroAnarchy," @jamesfisherman7669  partly agree, there will be bottlenecks where real lawyers will be necessary for a while. But let’s say you wanna sue your landlord or a car salesperson: you can either call a lawyer, wait two weeks, go there, pay $1500, wait two weeks and get the lawsuit. OR you could log into LegalGPT, pay $1,99 and have the lawsuit ready 1 min after you explained the case. The difference in cost and speed is so staggering, I don’t see it not taking over.   Someone on twitter had their quantum mechanics PHD thesis explained by a. AI and apparently it was better than any human he ever talked to about it.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

@MacroAnarchy," @saadshajy3849  yes, and these are just the first innings. Recently read china is moving quickly, they integrated their legal system into WeChat and are testing AI in that context. It’s pretty obvious to me that’s where it’s going. Most civil cases could be solved within a day using video chat & AI mediation, doesn’t even need to be binding, the AI could just give the most likely outcome and I’d say many would just agree to save cost and time.",1년 전,0,

But I don’t think they can win against this kind of progress, imagine having the choice to either pay a lawyer 5k or get a 9,99 monthly subscription for LegalAI that can process your whole case within 15 minutes. The difference is so massive, I don’t think there’s a way to prevent it.",1년 전,0,

@gibbeyii," @chrsl3  Don't agree, If you are connected to the internet it's better to believe it's not ""private"". Your computer can be hacked into from an outside location, the information can be intercepted while en route to a second location and this is not even getting into the discussion of what happens if GPT-6 or 7 or 8 gets to the point where it looks at your data and decides you are doing something wrong and notifies someone else? Who is ultimately controlling GPT? Is a government entity able to alter GPT so it would have GPT inform them if it saw information about a terrorist attack or a planned homicide or anything it wants?   Granted the possibilities of good are endless BUT the possibilities of abuse are endless also...   Even worse to me is the dumbing down of the general average population, I know guys that don't know their own mothers cell phone number because they have been hitting a speed dial number on their cell phone for so long that it is gone from their memory. If they lose their cell phone due to an accident they are lost.   A lot of people are loosing their brain power slowly but surely.   Have you ever watched the movie Wall-e?  ;)",2년 전(수정됨),8,
