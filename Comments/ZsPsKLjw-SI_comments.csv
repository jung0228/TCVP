I lit them up with a AIRJORDON slam dunk and a hook slam dunk with the lean. Come high school I was practicing and sinking center court shots. At the time the high school wanted me playing for the team but I refused them. When I was growing up from grade 8 on and even out of high school me and my friends played baseball, football and hockey every week. I’m out of shape now at 6’5” 280ish. I have weight lifted a bit not in gyms though and my heaviest squat lift peaked at a tiny bit north of 600lbs, I benched just over 390. Not sure what I can do now",8개월 전,0,

@makemoneyonline9384,"HOW PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE ADMINISTERED  1st choice: comfortable life (human contacts, fun, relationships, easy work)  2nd choice: remedy the one made by the first choice (all the opposite of the life of the first)   3rd choice, etc.: no personality suitable to survive, probable life as a tramp (in the middle of the street), absolutely no human contact, fun, future, precious things, relationships. With the personality they give you to do all these things it will be too complicated. Probable acts of violence or discrimination, no work or if there is very hard. High probability of suicide.   Procedure: there comes a time when suddenly Christ and Satan show up in front of the mirror and by deception force to choose one of the two. By choosing the first, the following things happen: Christ, the Virgin Mary and in case some saints show up and in case you are playing or having fun in any way they force you to work and toil helping someone always with their voice and their words inside your head. Their procedure consists of this: prevent you from having fun, drinking, masturbating, etc. and getting sledding like a mule.      Being as they say second choice, you should only work from morning to night and nothing else. Anything else is not good for them. At first Christ pretends to be God and shows you how he pretends to give you gifts by putting for a moment a kind of white glow at the height of the navel and telling you that they give a ""gift"" to everyone and no more than one but in reality, they are all lies that as you go on, they come out on their own. They try to frame you with vague promises, rewards and various scum once in what they call ""paradise"", but once they verify that the element in question doesn't take the bait (because he’s not a moron!) they begin to reveal their infamous procedures that they have implemented to try to ruin his life.   As a second choice you are given a very antisocial, extreme and stray personality so that you cannot have any kind of contact with other people (friendships, relationships) because you see everyone else as if they came from another planet and there is no kind of compatibility. In addition to this your physique is damaged with the following things and for the following reasons: first you will have few or no muscles at all as having been damaged at birth you will be sick and you will have a disposition to make revenge and war against everyone; per second you will have some knee problems that will prevent you from practicing any type of sport in a serious way and third you will have some kind of defect or imperfection in intimate parts such as various spots, in, strange shapes, etc. so as to prevent you from having any kind of relationship.      The second choice should according to their infamous system try to remedy the wrong things that someone who died 40 years ago or more has combined.  In paradise a kind of personal ""circle"" is created where there are the spirits of all the people who have had some kind of importance in your life: family members, sports idols, musicians, actors or characters compatible with your personality or with the life you have to make. All these characters are obliged to show up and say certain phrases with the purpose of deceiving and doing things that the person in question would not do in itself. They also take advantage of the relationship of admiration you had for them when they were alive to get you to have a conversation, but it's all a lie, the real purpose is to analyze your way of thinking and acting and your personality to see if you can overcome certain obstacles, cheating and lies that will try to get you on the road.     Of all the characters you see the Virgin Mary is the most annoying of all. She talks all the time saying a lot of lies to see if someone is so stupid to believe in it (like their altar boys) and she always and constantly repeats the same things until nausea (procedure). She cries all the time and says she's the most beautiful woman in the world.      Their way of speaking is to repeat in your head their phrases that irritate and provoke and annoy you to the point of nausea as the angriest you are, the more your nerves jump and the more vulnerable you are to them because you could lose control of your actions and do what they want. They never believe in threats to make them stop until they are put into practice.   At the beginning of the journey if you rebel against their infamous system, they can resort to making the devil appear. Not having chosen him appears much poorer than he appears to his followers. He can appear in many different forms but usually appears with red eyes and the stick it uses to subdue its followers. Among the things he does to you we find: images of spiders quite credible in the head, temptations of various kinds very treacherous. At first it makes you think he wants to take you into his group by always making you trawls to try to frame yourself (for example women you might have, things that might happen to you, etc.) and then tries to bother you at night by showing you his red eyes, goat legs, strange faces and telling you to come to his group. To try to submit use a kind of feeling of great warmth at the height of the navel that is transmitted throughout the body and that almost gives the feeling of fainting. It is overcome by always being in the company of someone, as it must be stealthy and cannot leave traces. During submission attempts, every thought, everything read and seen, and every memory will be used as a weapon against you.        On some occasions it may go so far as to tell you to give him your soul, that is, to perform the following ritual: to write explicitly your intention on a sheet of paper, to bring blood out of your body and sign with it. As a final act burn the sheet (which is absolutely to be avoided as then you do not go back).      Their followers to get any kind of role in hell must sacrifice everything they have in life and kill someone, better if someone they care about or some complete stranger and as a final gesture themselves.  Demons cannot bring anything out and it must be the adept who performs certain rituals to learn new things and improve level, but at each of these acts their lives are ruined more and more.

It’s isn’t cultural appropriation considering he’s good at ball now all of a sudden it’s culturally bound popular wise for inner city youth.

@RicardoOliveira-ji7yt,"And Martin Luther king is the king of what is a humanist. It is true that whites have been horrible egotistical and misinformed about what makes superiority in The far past.. sadly it is ingrained with what people fear or misunderstand and don’t relate to. I am myself white Portuguese a very homogenous culture historically but trying to do better. I am a good heart, so know system issues stratification and we live in a world sadly where online protesting has become the norm. The elite will allow micro victories for all minimalized/minorities sadly. The real protests for big change had been too slow too long and still disallowmfor real change to Hellen. Fear breeds money and power…for the elite and seriously ignorant how to change a big mess and work hand in hand.  But please ur outlook can better ur culture very true if u keep others informed but direct ur hate or battle let’s say in the right places. Your average American or whomever may have ingrained stereotypes but not per day racist and it’s the elite governments fault. Good people were corrupted as were First Nations to the point of inter generation poverty other things but that’s a systemic racism and economic combined issue and when white Americans in 1700s-1800s were what made up the masses along with Irish other cultures etc the crime rate was at Its highest so it’s sad that people fear a hardworking people inherently great and pure that were tainted by white america evil and still in comparison after all the hate even the worst black gangs are not as violent as American murders at their height caused by whites regardless of how deep this systemic racism goes is a testament, but most people today are intelligent and especially here in Canada (which faces its own racism with First Nations etc), are actually not your average racist citizen.   It is the white elitists that allow perpetuation of not healing in many ways..film music news depictions..painful reminders can be good but not to cause a psychological cycle of rumination it can be counterproductive as is the eye for an eye view. Forget American dream values with unequal privilege to obtain that dream and what is considered crime culturally bound to law marijuana at one point stealing to save a sick loved one in a skewered health care system. Unaffordable education for those not living  at home with mom and have rent and kids vs wages..wages vs cost of living.  Sometimes, healing means attacking the elite who’s really causing changes and steering the standards systemic privilege imbalance for political/financial/power gain and not the little folk 100s of years later who should have a full understanding taught with peace vs being  ignorant of history systemic issues at their core and normally day to day are kind and love all people and have no way or knowledge of helping fellow human out.",5개월 전,0,

@jakestewart5899,"I know this doesn't have anything to do with the video, but I would like to share these questions and this message with as many people as possible.   1. What do you think happens to someone after they die? 2. Do you think there is an afterlife?  3. If heaven exists, how do you get there?  4. Do you think you are good enough to get into heaven?   No one is good enough to get into heaven. Here are a few questions to test your goodness:    1. How many lies have you told in your whole life?  2. Have you ever stolen?  3. Have you ever used God's name in vain? 4. Jesus said that ""whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart"" (Matthew 5:28). Have you ever looked with lust?  5. If you have broken any of these commandments, would you be innocent or guilty on Judgment Day?  6. Would you go to Heaven or Hell?   The Bible says that ""all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone"" (Revelation 21:8) and ""Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people — none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God"" (1 Corinthians 6:9-10). So, if you are guilty of any of the ten commandments, then you are in trouble when Judgment Day comes! Do you know what God did for guilty sinners so that we wouldn't have to go to Hell?    2,000 years ago, God became a human being, Jesus of Nazareth, who suffered and died on the cross for our sins and rose from the dead on the third day, defeating death. The punishment that we deserve for breaking God's law, Jesus took in our place. He paid the fine that we could never pay so that God can legally set us free by forgiving our sins. He is just, by punishing evil through Jesus’ death on the cross, while being rich in mercy towards us.    What you have to do is repent, or turn toward God, and believe in Jesus Christ. Don't trust your own goodness, because, as Jesus said, “No one is good — except God alone” (Mark 10:18). Trust alone in the savior. The moment you do that, God will forgive every sin you have ever committed and grant you eternal life, and He will give you a new heart with new desires, so that you will love to do what is right. You will be born again. But you must repent and trust in Jesus.    When are you going to do that?

@aydenbradford8778," @razimove438  The reason why soccer is more popular than football isn’t because it’s “better”, it all has to do with the geographical location in which it started, and when it was invented. Soccer has been around for centuries, even before it’s official modern-day invention in 1863 in England. Football was made almost 80 years later in a completely different continent less accessible to the rest of the world. Not to mention that football is way more expensive to play and you need more than just a ball and some ground to run on. Basketball was also invented about 40-30 years later than soccer, in (again) a less favorable geographical location for sports. Again, it is also more complicated (and expensive) to set up than soccer, despite what you think. Please stop talking out of your ass, there is no “best sport”, moron.",4년 전,1,

It only becomes offensive if you give any meaning to it and only the people who are offended have such ideas about colours. Otherwise it's just another property like length or height.

@נמרודנמרוד-ת9י,"Why is love according to the method of the ""baal hasulam"" The wisdom of Kabbalah,  is the solution to all troubles for humanity? Because all nature is a force, a feature, a system, a formula of love.  Of connection and unity between opposites, between hot and cold, hard to soft, white and black, male and female, sweet and bitter, light and dark.  In every atom and particle, in every inanimate plant and life, the whole universe and beyond, the whole reality is the result of a connection between opposites.  For humanity and the individual, one power rules from the day of birth, hatred of others and self-love at its expense, egoism.  By combining the power of love with the equation, man maintains the connection between the opposites and thus stops resisting nature, and enters into harmony with it, which is the goal of nature, to do good to creatures.  Until then, man will suffer great and immense suffering in order to recognize and submit to the demand of nature, He must strive in his power and choice in loving others. Thus he will acquire intellect and wisdom to connect the two opposites and will complete the nature that was created with unintentional intent, but rather man must complete it, and manage it, and bring it to perfection.  And why did nature do that? (Nature and God are the same gematria 86)  In order for man to grow and develop in his free choice and thus conduct creation as the conductor of an orchestra,   And if man had been created in advance corrected and perfected?  So he was like a perfect animal, dog and cat. But their rank as a robot is controlled with no free choice but absolute instinct dominates them.   After all, a real benefit from a father to his son is nothing but that the son rises and grows according to the rank of his father and even above him. We were to conquer nature just like the one who created it. And not when judging and living a dog and a cat.  If so the solution Is not in increasing the hatred from which it is not lacking and will never be lacking because that is how it has been imprinted on us from the day of birth (Media you do a very bad job just a pity a lot of beatings along the way !!!!)  Nor in the abolition of hatred because it is power is in nature and should not be abolished.  But only in the addition of love and connection and oneness addition upon addition while being aware of the process.  The people of Israel will wake up !!! Followed by the whole world !!!!!  Nature (G-d) requires connection and oneness and if not, he has every means to educate man and humanity until his surrender.  He will not rest or sleep until the purpose of creation is completed. To do good to creatures. Come, O Bnei Yisrael, you are the first to realize this study !!!!!!!! And when you know, you will teach your brothers the peoples of the world.  This is called light to the Gentiles.  And this is a job we do not deserve at all in the meantime.  ""For my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples!""  Love friends only love. It is the solution for every individual and for everyone together.  how?  To do propaganda of connection and not of separation and hatred ..",5년 전,0,

I’m 5’8” and when I was a teenager I could do very basic dunks on a 10 ft rim. Like just one handed dunks. I did a few two handed off a bounce, but it wasn’t automatic. It was still pretty impressive for a short white guy to jump as high as I did. It took a lot of work. I don’t know how many people remember those jump programs that were out there. There was no internet so you had to just find them. They had all these workouts to do. Squats, calf raises, isometric exercise with a jump rope. I also had these shoes that had a platform under the toes so it made it where you were always working your calves. So I had some jumping ability, but I put in a ton of work. It’s horrible for your knees and not recommended, but I used to run and play with ankle weights on. They helped my vertical immensely.",5년 전,0,

@krishorst4734," @ROkorn49  Except when it comes to swimming. But its true what you say, black athletes have slightly longer limbs as well as a slightly different body structure which gives a higher center of gravity which is advantageous in certain sports that require strength and speed. The difference is tiny but enough to make a noticeable difference that's why for example black athletes have dominated  track athletics, since 1912 only 10 non-black athletes have held major titles out of 38.. I read a paper once that discussed that the genetics was aided by the slave trade! That rich countries imported the biggest, strongest most genetically superior slaves and their genes have been combining for 3 centuries now, that's why if you look at the major ex-slave countries and traders and colonies such as Jamaica, the US and the UK and some others, they all have superior athletes mostly originating from West Africa and they usually outshine the guys from those countries themselves because the strongest genes were taken back in the day.. Its really fucked up but in a sick way it makes sense. I mean no offence by this I am just saying what I read. I will tyr find that paper and leave a link if I can. However, its also been ""scientifically"" proven that the biggest, strongest races are the people from the South Pacific islands such as Tongans, Mauri's etc. I am a firm believer that on average we are all equal, sure some are bigger or stronger or taller but in the end we all average out. We are all different but we all bleed red, we all black when the lights go out and if you remove  or skins there is no difference what so ever.

@fencserx9423," @ROkorn49  You’re assumptions are statistically stupid. First and foremost, it’s been proven that the average Black Male has denser muscles than the average white male yes. The Lungs thing is incorrect (even so, bigger lungs does NOT = higher VO2 max. So it’s relevance is questionable at best.) and the Bone thing is conflicting. This simply means that in a population selecting for muscle density (such as sprinting or jumping) black men will have a better natural starting point. This is centimeters on the inch. Seconds on the mile. However, with training and other factors (muscle placement, and bone SHAPE- which plays a lot in running, and also CULTURE as it relates to sport popularity and the probability of selecting these genetically gifted individuals) the highest achievers in this sport will be black. Like sprinting. And basketball (although basketball specifically is far more cultural than genetic variance given that it’s a team sport). Now what you said “black people have genetically superior athletic ability” is incoherently false. SOME black people are naturally better at SOME sports. MOST black people are on par with MOST white people, it’s at the top .3% of people that you see the difference in any meaningful way... which only matters in sports where 1/100th of a second or .1% increased efficiency counts... like running. So no, white people do not need to train 3x harder (which is a physiologically incoherent sentence as well), white people (assuming this very stupid view of training) would need to train at most 1.5% harder.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@eggmeister6641," @ROkorn49  here's some actual data:  people of african descent had scarcer access to food, and thus evolved slower metabolisms to survive. this means that, when put in a calory surplus, they are more likely to gain weight (both fat and muscle) than those of european descent. HOWEVER, there's a certain gene mutation fairly common in europe that's quite rare in africa, called MSTN (myostatin defficiency, or commonly called the ""hercules"" gene). as a result, most sports are dominated by african-derived people, bar some. sports that require a great amount of stamine (strength + speed + endurance) tend to be dominated by europeans and asians, where the elite that live further west have greater strength and speed and the elite further east have greater strength and endurance.  this is why powerlifting / olympic weightlifting is dominated by asians and strongman competitions are dominated by caucasians, while most others are dominated by africans.  edit: left something out. after the ""event"" that happened with the neanderthals (we fucked them up), some humans remained in europe, while others went back to africa. due to harsher weather and more bountiful resources, the eurpoeans both had ability and incentive to develop their toolmaking skills. over the course of several of thousands of years a partial (but not complete. remember, evolution is less ""finely crafting"" and more ""duct tape and glue"") evolution, we ended up developing greater fine motor skills. not great enough to make a big difference, but great enough that it can be graphed. of course, this pales in comparison to easterners, who practically invented the textile and printing industry.  of course, all this will be negated within the next 200 years as people of different races ""crossbreed"" and thereby share their traits. no race is that much greater than any other race at any specific activity. it's just that, at the very highest level of sport, every small advantage adds up.\  i hope this was educational. tldr: africans are good at some stuff. europeans are good at some stuff. asians are good at some stuff. we're all good at some stuff. so why argue about it?",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@LuisFernando-yd3mx,"There is such a thing as hang time. Anybody can jump up and dunk the ball, but to jump up and into the basket and over other people or do spins requires hang time, aka, the ability to jump so well that you float into the area you want to go to.",4년 전,1,
@troliskimosko, @LuisFernando-yd3mx  hangtime is directly correlated to vertical jump. it's basic physics. body control can give the illusion off longer hangtime but it's vertical that decides the exact time you'll spend in the air,4년 전,0,
@LuisFernando-ot9yv," @troliskimosko  have you played basketball before or are a high jumper? Vertical is just one component. He needs to be able to jump well directionally to know which direction to go and control his transversal plane or else he wouldn't be able to float over, or around people or the basketball tim.",4년 전,0,
@troliskimosko,"Luis Fernando exactly, that’s where the body control comes in, but hangtime itself is somewhat of an illusion. people with lesser verticals can appear to stay in the air longer from how they bend they’re knees and use they’re hips to manuever and such but will generally have a measured hangtime of significantly less than higher jumpers who perhaps don’t feel as long up in the air hangtime-wise",4년 전,0,

These two eggs, or zygotes, form identical twins who share the same genetics and that’s why they look so much alike. In the case of fraternal twins they are dizygotic, meaning there are two separate eggs fertilized simultaneously. They do NOT share identical genetics. It’s the same as two siblings being born years apart. In fact, only 1/3 of all twins born are identical and 2/3 of them are not.

@Harmlessgamers2893,"@Bblurre i'm sorry bud but you got that wrong. Treating someone differently based on the colour of their skin = racism. If you have any respect whatsoever you just dont do it, no matter what colour you are. Saying blacks cant be racist shows that you only mind if black are targetted, which means you're no better than the rest. The world is bigger than the USA. Be the right example!  By the way, blacks aren't the only race that suffered. I looked up my family history years ago and found out that my ancestors before 1730 were ""owned by the state"". AKA slaves. I NEVER play the victim game, mostly because i realise that it wont be taken seriously in the first place because apparently blacks are the only victims, ever, but also because it's in the past. No one alive today had any influence on it so crying does NOTHING, all it does is show that some people are afraid to let go and move on. You cant constantly be scared of someone hurting you based on the color of your skin, that's no life bud  The sooner you shake that victim mentality, the stronger you'll be.",5년 전(수정됨),4,
@Harmlessgamers2893,"@Bblurre if you say that blacks cant be racist, that shows you have victim mentality. Simple as that. You are waving away racism against other ethnic groups as if it's nothing. Also you can stop acting as if you know anything at all about my family history. If a white suffers it's indentured, if a black suffers it's slavery? You're insane. Like i said. Victim mentality.   And btw i really cant imagine people feeling superior about their race except for maybe white supremacists and people that constantly point fingers at other races. Which is stupid as hell. I dont see why those people should be taken seriously to begin with. It's not as if every white is a white supremacist, give us a fucking break",5년 전(수정됨),4,
@katocs,"@Bblurre You literally said they ""arent racist they are prejudiced"" while the wikipedia definition says racism is also defined by prejudice and you say its supporting your point? Are you dellusional?   By the way I read this other guys comment and white people were actually vastly enslaved in the middle east and during the ottoman empires time. ACTUAL SLAVES, no servants. Who do you think built the pyramids? It was white jewish and non jewish people.   If you actually think theres a race who cant be racist youre more than stupid.   What you said about black people is and I quote ""If they dont like white people, it's because of experiences they've had.""    So if I say I dont want a black man in my house its not racist when something related happened to me in the past?

I was the tallest kid in my neighborhood, so I always played down low, which didn't serve me well when I got to high school.  My school had 2700 kids and there wasn't much of a call for centers or power forwards at my height, but was a bit of a force in intermurals.  And regardless, my statement stands; there's more to the game than the ability to jump high and grab a stationary ball, if he had skills, he would have been given a chance.  Also, my game was, and still is, baseball.  I haven't missed a summer on the diamond since 1967.",6년 전,0,

@arranpattison5809," @NickolasGaspar8bit  Well put bro! People like to throw out the 'racist' label when it doesn't usually apply. The terms 'white man can't jump' or 'black man can't swim' or 'asians can't drive' etc are based on stereo types because the odds maybe higher that this is the case. But its great and sometimes surprising when someone 'breaks' that stereotype isn't it? If we love humanity, then we should embrace this as this video demonstrated. NBA dudes couldn't believe it but they loved it!  Racism is about intent.  Stereotyping is about observation... I dunno about you, but I love it when people 'break' the stereo type good or bad, because it shows us that we're all part of the human family. Different but alike.  😊👍",5년 전,0,

@MissionaryInMexico," @goastlyarrowplays  Backboard is just about 9 feet. But why would I jump and put my knee straight out from my hip? Thanks what you're saying, with yoyr huge miscalculation about jumping heights. I had a 54"" vertical jump in middle school, and a little less after the injury... We were taught when i started basketball in the 4th grade to put KNEE TO CHEST while jumping. Sounds like you've never played a sport in your life if you didn't know that. My knee and shoulder hit it at the same time. So.. yeah. My jumping abilities began because I started in a hard style of Okinawan karate at 6 years old and grew up on a farm that i worked my ass off from 6 years old until my military years. In high school and in the military, there were a few of us who could jump up and kick the rim with our feet with no problem. I smashed my knee and it put me out of playing basketball but it didn't hurt me too bad that I couldn't do karate or other martial arts, and track and field and cross country.",6년 전(수정됨),1,
@ashleygaden1175,White men can't jump? Why have you rarely seen a black man win a high jump competition? The highest jumpers in the world as the strongest men are white. Then you have sprinting 99% of the top black sprinters in the past 40 years done for steroids. Before black steroid use took over the olmypics white and black men were evenly winning the sprint races.

We were all amazed. Because there was absolutely no regular Air Force job for them. This was free military training for track and field for Olympic hopefuls in Germany. Many of those German Air Force Track and Fielders ended up in the Olympics. Only a few of ours did, but not while active duty. I was only allowed to practice off duty. Yes I conducted my regular military job, which i did well and I am honorably discharged, and the base commander had to give all competitors leave papers to go on any of the meets we had.

Either way, white people hold world records in basically every jumping category...and the top dunkers right now are white guys...  So the whole white guys can't jump is not true at all. Yes a small percentage of blacks have an advantage of more fast twitch muscle fibers which leads to overall better sprinting skills. Fast twitch muscle fiber alone doesn't equate to better jumping skills, but it certainly doesn't hurt.   I find it funny that the majority of people in the world don't realize that white people have held basically every single record and won every single strength competition in history...yet people don't go around saying ""Black people can't lift weights.""  Honestly that stereotype would be more fitting given the dominance of whites in strength related sports.",8년 전,0,

Drink plenty of water and get at least 7 to 8 hours of rest at night so your muscles can recover and heal.  Do exercises 3 to 4 times a week and each week slightly progress with weights but not to fast, because you don't want to risk having an injury.

However, your quote, 'blacks can't be racist' is far from the truth. Black people make fun of black people for not being black enough, or for being 'midnight' black.

Now if Gary Payton would have taken that stereotype and said ""nah bro, you can't dunk here"" but then let the black guy who was in the line to dunk, dunk...then that would have been racist.

@brittanytripp6151,"+BodiedByBhead Bran Racism is the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races. A stereotype is a widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing. I agree that you are right, it is a commonly held stereotype. However, it does indeed fit the definition of racism as well. In fact, racism is a product of the interaction of a race-based worldview with prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination. Meaning discrimination is in and of itself a leg of racism when directed to a particular ethnicity.",9년 전,0,

During obamas speech when he has the comedian come into the dinner and tell the ""white people"" joke everyone laughed and that was it about it.

@brittanytripp6151,"+BodiedByBhead Bran The difference between racism and stereotyping is that stereotyping extends further than race issues. Discriminatory is making or showing an unfair or prejudicial distinction between different categories of people or things, especially on the grounds of race, age, or sex. Prejudice is a preconceived opinion that is not based on actual experience. From what we're to understand these people had never seen this white person dunk or play basketball before, meaning they had no idea how the guy would play.  So here I disagree with you, it is indeed discriminatory prejudice.  The only difference is I see between your two examples is that one is not inherently bad and one that is more likely to be seen as negative. If someone said black people can't cook anything but good fried chicken, would it make it more or less racist to you? What if there were two caterers, one black and one not black, available for an event and the group happens to want fried chicken to be made. Without having tried any of their dishes, would you find it racist if the black person was chosen over the nonblack person because ""ayy black people know how to cook good fried chicken."" From what I understand, racism does not have to be inherently perceived as negative or focus on the bad parts of a race. It does not. Racism can also be positive. By this I do not mean that racism is good. Rather, positive racism occurs when someone attributes good qualities to a person based solely on race.",9년 전,0,

Yes, I understand that North and South Africa have issues, but they're not too bad in comparison.  And arguing gene superiority is foolish and not that great an argument in the first place. But I don't think that's what you're trying to refer to.  Trying to gauge what the average African male would look like physically is hard, due to the extreme variations that exist between countries.  There are some places where malnutrition and starvation have led to people being in incredibly poor shape.  On the flip-side, there are people in Africa that are incredible physically.   The reasons behind why Ghurka soldiers are so incredible is very different than what I believe you to think them to be.  Ghurka soldiers are amazing because where they live naturally is the highlands of Peru and a few other countries in that region.  Because they live in the highlands they need more red blood cells to get enough oxygen.  When they come down those hills they now get lots of extra oxygen.  That extra oxygen means they have more stamina.  Also, the culture they live in and where they live means that their normal lifestyle are very strenuous, so they're physically fit before they enter the British army, have survival knowledge, etc. that comes with living more primitive lifestyles.
