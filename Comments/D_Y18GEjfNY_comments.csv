@xxiiinimai,"The spinning chip, a marvel of both engineering and artistry, captivates the imagination with its mesmerizing motion and intricate design. At first glance, it may seem like a simple object, but upon closer inspection, its beauty and functionality become apparent. The spinning chip's design is a testament to human creativity and ingenuity. Each chip is carefully crafted with precision and attention to detail, ensuring that it spins smoothly and gracefully. From the materials used to the shape and weight distribution, every aspect of the chip's design plays a role in its performance. One of the most fascinating aspects of the spinning chip is its ability to defy gravity and balance on a point. This seemingly impossible feat is achieved through a combination of physics and engineering. The chip's shape and weight distribution are carefully calculated to create a center of mass that allows it to spin on its axis without falling over. But the spinning chip is not just a technical marvel—it is also a work of art. The intricate patterns and designs etched onto the surface of the chip add a touch of elegance and beauty. Whether it's a simple geometric pattern or a more elaborate artistic design, each chip is a unique expression of creativity. Beyond its aesthetic appeal, the spinning chip also has practical applications. In industries such as gaming and entertainment, spinning chips are used in various games and activities to add an element of excitement and challenge. They are also used in physics demonstrations and educational settings to illustrate concepts such as angular momentum and balance. In conclusion, the spinning chip is a fascinating and multifaceted object that combines technical innovation, artistic expression, and practical utility. Its ability to spin gracefully while defying gravity is a testament to human creativity and ingenuity, making it a beloved object for enthusiasts and a valuable tool for engineers and educators alike.

@thatnoobnextdoor,"While I also like the idea of the hat's rim being the dipping container, I still think the design from The Simpsons is superior. The biggest problem with the Tortilla Sombrero is that once you start breaking pieces off of the rim, the guacamole is at risk of leaking out, we even see this in the movie. It's also less structurally sound. The Nacho Hat's rim can be broken with less risk of leaking dip on the wearer, and the dip is better supported on top of the person's head, instead of weighing down the rim. Finally, the top of the Sombrero is just wasted space, while the entirety of the Nacho Hat is utilized.",3년 전,1.4천,

We have to be extremely diligent about continuing to be as cautious as possible and doing our bests to continue to lie low even as trends improve for us Americans personally. But of course, I know people need to get back to their jobs and are doing what they can to cautiously pick up their previous lives, and I appreciate that!

As for the consequences, well... allow me to explain this in a suitable manner:  The Mafia know I exist. They don't know my name, they don't know where I live, they don't know what I look like, or what I've done. But they know I've done something unforgivable against Italy, because they and all other Italians probably felt what I've... wrought... just a few minutes ago.  It's a disturbing, writhing mass of shapeless... tendrils. That's what I can best describe it as visually, but to stare upon it for too long is to stare into the void, and invite madness. I know what I have done, and that there is but one course of action lest I leave it be and forever curse this world with my wrongdoings.  I shall cast this monstrosity into the briney, watery depths reminiscient of the place one might assume it would hail from. If I am not seen in future comment sections, assume that I have perished and that this abomination may well have consumed me more than I would have consumed it.

@cribb," Stannis Baratheon  The correct information is widely available on the internet, which you clearly have access to since you are on Youtube.  This pandemic has been ongoing for over a year now.  If you don't understand how masks and social distancing can help to decrease the spread of a deadly virus after over a year of this, then there's no amount of information or statistics that I can provide you with to change your mind.  Also, your assertion that people recognizing Covid for the threat that it is and taking basic precautions equates to fear is incorrect.  It's called empathy.  I'm not particularly scared of getting Covid myself, but if masking, social distancing, and getting vaccinated can help drastically reduce the chances that I contract Covid, that also drastically reduces the chances that I could potentially pass on a deadly virus to someone who may be more vulnerable than me or whose immune system is not as capable of fighting off the virus.  I think I'll take the advice of epidemiologists and immunologists who have spent their careers studying, researching, and working with transmittable diseases rather than some random guy on Youtube.",4년 전,4,

You know what they say, it's the doers' opinions that matters. The shapers and movers of the dough determine what it becomes. Also that shape came out fantastic. Bravo.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

In Minionese, some words are apparently borrowed from Asian languages (such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean).
