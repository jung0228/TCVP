@pjfromnyc,"David goggins canthurtme chapter 5  Chapter 5 of Can't Hurt Me: ""Armored Mind""  In Chapter 5, David Goggins introduces the concept of the ""Armored Mind"" and the 40% Rule—the idea that when you think you're done, you're really only at 40% of your true potential.  Key Lessons from Chapter 5:  1. The 40% Rule – Most people quit at 40% of their capability. The mind creates artificial limits, but you can push beyond them through discipline and mental toughness.   2. Callousing the Mind – Just like hands develop calluses from hard labor, the mind gets tougher by enduring pain, discomfort, and suffering.   3. Taking Control of Your Inner Dialogue – Instead of letting negative thoughts dictate your actions, you must override them with self-talk, visualization, and relentless effort.   4. Discomfort = Growth – Every time you push past pain, you build a stronger, more resilient mindset.    Challenge #7: Remove the Governor  This chapter sets up Challenge #7, where Goggins tells you to push beyond the point where your mind tells you to stop—whether in a workout, a race, or any area of life.  How You Can Apply This Chapter:  Next time you feel like stopping (whether in running, sobriety, or discipline), tell yourself you're only at 40% and push a little further.  Use previous wins (the Cookie Jar) as proof that you can endure.  Train yourself to get comfortable being uncomfortable—because that’s where real growth happens.   Does this chapter resonate with you? Have you ever felt like you were at your limit, only to realize you had more to give?  Give me a story example of how I can apply this tactic  Applying the 40% Rule: A Sobriety Story  Let’s say you’re on a difficult day in your sobriety journey. The cravings hit hard, and the urge to relapse feels overwhelming. It’s one of those days where your mind is telling you, ""Just one drink won’t hurt. You’ve been sober for a while now. You’ve earned it.""  This is when the 40% Rule comes in: your mind is trying to stop you at 40% of your true potential, and you need to push past that point to maintain your sobriety.  How to Apply the 40% Rule in This Moment:  1. Recognize the Mind’s Limits – Instead of succumbing to the urge, recognize that your mind is only showing you 40% of your potential to handle the situation. The craving is temporary, but your strength is much more enduring.   2. Challenge the Thought – When that voice tells you to give in, respond with, “I’ve been here before. I’ve fought these battles, and I’ve won. This is just my mind trying to stop me. I’ve got more in me than this.""   3. Get Active – Change your environment. Go for a run, talk to someone who supports your sobriety, or focus on a task that requires all your energy. The key is to do something that forces you to move beyond the craving—this is where the growth happens.   4. Use Your “Cookie Jar” – Remind yourself of past moments when you faced intense urges and overcame them. Think of your sober milestones, your strength, and the peace you’ve gained. These wins become your armor, and each one proves to you that you’re stronger than you think.   5. Push Through the Mental Block – With every moment you push past your craving, you’re removing that mental governor. The next time you face a similar challenge, it’ll feel easier because you’ve expanded your capacity.    By following this, you realize that the discomfort and urges are temporary. You are capable of far more than your mind leads you to believe in the moment.  This is a mindset that you can apply every day in your sobriety journey. Have you had moments where you felt the urge to quit, but pushed through anyway? This is exactly the kind of mental toughness Goggins talks about in Chapter 5.",7개월 전,1,

@johnnyamerica44,"Successful businessman invites advice and encouragement from Navy Seal who, while running the race, breaks ALL the small bones in BOTH FEET and incurs KIDNEY DAMAGE.

@MohammedSARRAJ-r1c,"1. Meeting SEAL: The speaker first encountered SEAL during a 100-mile run in San Diego. While the speaker was part of a team with extensive supplies, SEAL was running the entire race alone with minimal gear. Despite facing serious physical challenges during the race, including broken bones and kidney damage, SEAL finished the race.  2. Inviting SEAL to Live with Him: After learning more about SEAL's story, the speaker invited him to live with his family for a month. The speaker was at a point in his life where he was successful but stuck in a routine and wanted to push himself to grow further.  3. First Lesson in Resilience: On SEAL’s first day, he challenged the speaker to do pull-ups. After the speaker struggled to complete a set, SEAL insisted that they would not leave until the speaker did 100 more pull-ups, demonstrating that people have much more capacity than they believe.  4. The 40% Rule: SEAL taught the speaker about the ""40% rule,"" which states that when your mind tells you you're done, you're really only 40% done. This idea is central to pushing past mental limits and discovering hidden reserves of strength.  5. Embracing Discomfort: SEAL encouraged the speaker to embrace discomfort in everyday life to challenge personal limits. His motto, ""If it doesn’t suck, we don’t do it,"" was designed to constantly push the speaker out of his comfort zone.  6. The Power of Will: The speaker reflects on how, even in challenging situations like marathons, people find strength beyond their initial limits. It's about applying that willpower not just in one-off events, but in daily life.",8개월 전,0,

For most people, even a minor failure, set-back, or problem is enough for them to abandon whatever it is that they are doing.

@MichaelGerryYoutube,"Hello, I'd like to share a personal anecdote to help those who are watching or have watched this video.   I came across this story before I got serious about physical fitness. When I eventually decided to start doing high-rep body weight movements to get into better shape, I kept this sentiment about ""pushing through the pain"" and achieving the end goal ""at all costs"" in mind.   About a year into training, I developed a wrist injury. I trained through it, doing 600 push ups every other day for a month, because I thought that's what this Navy SEAL would've done. After all, he broke his feet and almost died running his race, and all seemed to turn out fine; what's a little wrist pain?  A few months later, with the wrist injury still hanging around, I was extremely sore on a day that I was supposed to do 50 chin ups. Instead of resting, I thought of this Navy SEAL, and I knew that ""he would've pushed through the pain""; so, I did too. The next day, I had rhabdomyolysis, and I was unable to train for over a week and lost significant strength and muscle mass in both arms.   Then, in easing back into training after the rhabdo, the amount of stress I was putting on the wrist injury finally hit a tipping point and I developed a serious injury, preventing me from being able to work out for months, and introducing pain into almost all of the routine tasks that were required for the cabinetry work and writing and video editing that I was doing at the time.   A couple of months later, honoring the same ""grit your teeth and persevere"" sentiment, I developed a knee injury and then pushed through it, working two 10 hour days doing labor-intensive, backroom work at a department store.   Today, over a year after both injuries, after more than $6000 of medical bills, and months of physical therapy for each body part, I still have two chronic injuries that significantly affect everything I do on a daily basis.  You're human, and your body knows when it needs rest. It knows when you need to stop. It knows when you're at risk of doing something really bad. If you ignore the signs your body is showing you, you're going to get seriously injured, and those injures may last the rest of your life.   I share this message because I desperately wish, in the place that I'm sitting now, that I would've read the ""counterpoint"" to this 40% rule when I first came across it. In certain circumstances, pushing yourself beyond your ""boundaries"" may make sense, and it may even be necessary. But, when it comes to your body, training, health, longevity, and your daily routine; put your health first if you're able to.",3년 전,0,

@spicymeatballs2thespicening," @fakebobbyhill296  damn that's horrific, what did you mean by never recovering though",3년 전,0,
@fakebobbyhill296," @spicymeatballs2thespicening  Well that was 8 and a half years ago, and I still can render myself almost completely immobile for days if I breathe wrong. It actually happened again just last week. If I accidentally over move my arm I feel like my shoulder is falling off. I can’t sit too long or my back starts to throb, and I can’t stand to long or it starts to throb, and I can’t be still to long or it starts to throb, and I can’t move much or it starts to throb. I basically have to dance around all day and night changing positions or I’m screwed. All the while, though my pain is not throbbing, rest assured in knowing it’s still fully there. I have protrusions of cartilage between I think 6 of my vertebrae, and nerve and musculoskeletal damage in my back, neck, and shoulder. No amount of exercise will ever fix it. I can’t do yoga because stretching = muscles tearing. Due to the traumatic nature of my injury and nerve damage, I also can’t get massage therapy. And physiotherapy is no longer covered by WSIB. My doctor never told me about surgery being an option, and it probably wouldn’t be covered either, and so as far as I know… It’s never getting any better. In fact being 35 y.o. at this point it’s only going to get worse with age, and the stuff I thought had improved is probably going to creep up on me again in a few years. Not to mention that I’m pretty sure one of my ribs and/or my back might have broken and they didn’t see it because they were looking for injuries in the wrong place on my xrays and they didn’t even know what I was talking about when I told the doctors and nurses that “I had been grabbed by a lathe” so they just put polysporin on, and wrapped my horribly bruised arm and told me to go back to work the next day.   Well within two weeks I was never able to work since, and am almost entirely untreated and uncared for. Oh and I’m coming up on ten years in the lawsuit. (Actually I’m at around 7.5 years in the lawsuit, but almost 10 sounds more gruelling lol) oh and the lawsuit… the WSIB is going to pay to have me totally retrained in something non physical so they can get me back to work instead of opening a life long claim, despite the fact that I am going to be suffering from all of this and be expected to be able to work, pay attention to my work, and not be a disturbance. With no compensation for my injury, or pain and suffering. And the kicker? As soon as training starts, I lose my disability coverage, and if and when it is determined again that I can’t work, I will no longer meet the contribution requirements to get disability coverage back. So after my lawyer is successful, I’m completely screwed. And if the WSIB pays me lost wages for the time between now and my accident, I have to pay back the gov for my disability because “I can’t come out ahead” That’s, I think, around 55% of that money. And I owe my lawyer 30-40% depending on if it goes to court. So at best I’m looking at 5-15% of ever being made whole after my accident, I burned through my savings for retirement before disability payments kicked in so I have no nest egg, I will no longer qualify for a pension, my pain will never go away, and I will eventually be forced back to work despite this, with no chance of ever retiring. So that’s what my life has in store for me.  Lesson: stay away from dangerous work, because you aren’t as looked after as they say, and literally nobody has your back if you get hurt. At least in Ontario that is.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

@akhilmohananYT," @jm.fantin here, let me help you understand a little thing , everyone is capable of doing what he is doing, there are many people who have sorted their life out from way worse shit than he went through and they were all normal people but you know what, out of the whole population of the world only 0.1% actually achieve this feat(and this is me being generous and the actual number is way lower) and goggins is definitely in the top 10 of that list, the rest of the world lacks the discipline and the mental callus that he has and most of them are gonna stay that way and settle for less while never achieving their true potential and this is a fact.   If everyone had the mentality that goggins has then there would be nothing special about him.   People can always improve and they should but most people in the world never maximise their true potential and that's just the way it is. Stop staying in a bubble where you think everyone can achieve what he has achieved.   ""i bet he is way more satisfied with his life now""?? Ofc he is, you did some real Einstein math there.

You can try as hard as you want but you'll never be good if you don't put effort into the ""getting better"" part which is where most of your effort should be directed. Not towards trying harder when your trying to execute your knowledge. Guitar and drums taught me that. I used to think that I was just a stupid retard who was not intelligent enough to be good at those things because I tried hard, very hard. And I still never got to where I wanted because my effort was being put to the wrong place.

@jessicalee333,"Absolute nonsense. A man ruined his bones and gave himself organ damage for a hobby. Anyone who thinks that's somebody to take life advice from doesn't deserve a 4-minute segment on an influential channel. Of course that ""40 percent rule"" applies if you NEED to do something to survive and it doesn't matter if you do permanent damage to your health along the way. You can always push yourself beyond when you're ""done"", but in day-to-day life, common sense dictates that you STOP when you're done, so you don't completely exhaust yourself or injure yourself, so you can keep doing stuff tomorrow. There is NO REASON to go beyond that point ever in life, except in dire circumstances.  It's good to KNOW you've got something ""left in the tank"", but it's no good if you're constantly draining your tank to empty just because you know you haven't completely destroyed yourself yet. How long did that dude have to recover after his hobby race where he mashed his feet to paste? How is that helpful, when most people have to do shit EVERY DAY in life? It's good to know where your limits are, but having comfortable limits that keep you going EVERY DAY is just basic sanity.

I think the broader and more helpful message is you may be able to go further than you think at times when you need to and the stakes are high, but that definitely comes with a caveat.

What I wonder is how long these extreme lifestyle people live, and if they could have lived longer had they lived a less extreme version of it. But hey, some people like it short and sweet.

@renookami4651,"We are capable of more than these 40% sure, but there is also a reason why the body is programmed this way.  To avoid unnecessarry injuries, and prevent constant exaustion to have lasting effects. It feels great to get past the limit, to see the results of training even pushing that limit further away, but it is as important to know the difference between ""the illusion"" and your actual limits.  I see a lot of comments taking sports as exemple but it goes well beyong that. Just look at how many people burn-out because ""pushing forward"" without a care for their mental or physical well being became their daily routine...  I used to be an artist, a crappy one but still willing to improve. I pushed forward learning multiple media, taking weird jobs, doing 10h livestreams daily to show people they can push forward...Till I got chronic pain and passed out of exaustion. My doc told me to take a break.  Which I didn't listen to (because of course I didn't) and now can't even use chopsticks on top of regularly dropping what I hold in that hand. My dexterity gone worse, meaning that I'm back at square one even tho I do have technical and theorical knowledge. Sure, I can tech, but my career as an artist is virtually over.  Always yearn to improve yourself, overcome ""the illusion past when the hype dies down"" but always be sure to know your limits! Wanna get past the norm? Aim for 60% if you dare but keep those last 40% to rest and recover . Don't go beyond that aside of special occurences.  Long story short: A marathon IS an event to test your limits and ""go 100% for a day"" but isn't ment to be a daily routine.",3년 전,0,

@WormholeJim,"After watching this, I'm not so sure that 40%rule is for ordinary people to heed. Engaged in the sort of covert military operation like the SEALS are, it puts them several notches above the opposition and enables the team to accomplish it in the face of impossible odds - and it absolutly makes sense to center the training and whole life-approach around that rule. But to most of us - it's not a sensible thing to tap into that reserve of hidden-away energy, not like that through a forced strain. It wears out the system immensily, and does not make you stronger in terms of any physical gains. Repeatedly forcing the body can eventually weaken the immunesystem and central nervoussystem to a point where actual sickness, both acutely and chronically can easily take hold to invalidating degree at a much earlier point in life than would otherwise be the case. If what you're doing requirer you to survive at all costs to accomplish, like a soldier, then it doesn't matter if you pay for this outburst of excessive energy in the moment with a couple of years in the senior-end of your life. But if you're an ordinary person like most are, there are other methods of mastering this hidden energy-reserve and which rewards as huge mental benefits as the 40% rule, as well as they reward actual physical betterment of the system in it's entirety. These methods, although different in different places and different traditions have all in common that they have been taught for thousands of years, are well established and greatly revered by those who practice them.",6년 전,0,

If you start looking at the statistics, you will see that it's not a guarantee but it is a guaranteed struggle.

And I was admitted at a physiotherapy center for urgent cases like accidents. So I know A LOT about pain and working through it. I ran my first 5km cross-country in high school with lymphoedemia on my right leg (no lymphatic system, you can google it, it's scary) and ended up WAY ahead of a friend of mine who was better trained that I was 3 months before. I took advantages that my right leg can't feel much of anything to reinforce it with Tae-kwon-do kicks. Could explode 2 ceramic plates of about 1cm each laid on top of another - and I mean exploding them, not breaking them. I had to stop because of mental illness I became too strong for my own good. I know A LOT about pain and working out with the worst possible ""normal"" body you can imagine. This is the WORST advice I have EVER heard in my entire life. This man is NOT in good shape.

People like him are always looking for ways to improve, to learn from others, and keep moving forward, recognizing the shapes in their lives that hold them back (""I was in a rut""). He's highly sensitive to the changes in his ""everyday"", and looks to improve the ways he does things. If you wonder why people succeed, it's not because they got lucky and met a person who gave them some hidden secret to life. No, these self-made people have the attitude of seeing what's holding them back, being capable of looking at their being from the outside, without bias. That's one of the reasons why some people just succeed, but getting that attitude and being capable of looking at yourself like that are the real challenge. Not finding a Navy Seal lol",6년 전,0,

(52 bones in both feet). This is because there are a LOT of small bones in the feet. NO ONE breaks ALL the small bones in their feet, under any circumstance, (short of jumping in a woodchipper), and certainly; no one is continuing to run marathons afterwards if they did manage to. It is possible to break a couple of these small bones and continue to run on sheer adrenaline for a while, but it would be extremely foolish to persist in worsening the already significant damage for stubborn pride.

@bigred8438,"This discussion, reminds me of the idea of having to reinvent yourself with the biggest hurdle being how we think about everything. For me this happened on ajungle trek that was overloaded with physical, emotional and psychological challenges. My friends back home who knew better, thought l had a death wish (interesting term, makes you wonder whether you have to almost meet death to live well). In the washup l had a nervous break down right there in the jungle. I was done, l was prepared to curl up and meet my death. Some how l pushed through and continued on against even more setbacks. When l looked back on that experience, once home, as l didn't know at the time what was happening or what would become of me, l was just experiencing it after all, l realised that l had unshakedled my brain of a whole range of negative - l can't  do this - type of thinking and had entered a different phase of life. In most ways now, l am a can do person, as it relates to me personally, but am not an optimist because my life involves others and many of them are children, who may never have a chance to be broken in spirit and in mind, then remade like l was, because they are molly-codalled.

I had to take muscle relaxers to calm them. Moral of the story....don’t go overkill and push too much past your limit. Listen to your body.

I didn't hit the count of 100 but I nailed 80 pull ups, 50 push ups and 50 tricep dips, all of this in about 50 min at the gym. I never saw myself meeting this goal any time in the next 6 months on my own.  I see so many people out here making fun of the Seal and his accomplishments. Our history is full of stories where people have accomplished the unthinkable against the greatest odds. It shouldn't be so hard to believe that the man completed the marathon under the said circumstances. Show some respect people. He has earned it.  Thank you Itzler, and thank you Seal David Goggins, for sharing this video and your stories.  If I get a chance, I surely would like to invite him over to my house to live with me.",7년 전,1,

In fact distance running has been proven to strengthen joints, bones, ligaments.  If you as an individual find running uncomfortable chances are YOUR body isn’t very well suited for distance running.   For MANY other people who are well suited for distance running they don’t typically develop health issues.   Distance runners generally have far healthier bodies (far stronger cardiovascular systems) than the general population and continue to have great health in very old age.  The people who develop issues later in life typically weren’t very well suited for distance running to begin with.   Again, if you find running a “chore” chances are you don’t have the ideal distance runners physique and would be better off doing something else for YOUR health.

If he broke every single bones in both of his feet and had kidney damage around 70 miles mark, he would need to crawl for 30 miles / his body also cant produce ATP properly from his fats / muscles and the lactic and waste build up in his body would render him inmobile  I think it is important if you going to make up a story / or embellish greatly, at least get the basics to obey the law of science and nature.",7년 전,0,

The first thing I noticed is that this guy never put in the work the seal team guy did he just told you what he noticed about that seal team guy and how it made him better.  That being said I noticed that I had to watch an advertisement before this video started. Then I noticed this guy has 6.1 million views on this video alone, and then I looked at his subscribers and saw that he had over 2.1 million subscribers. Now as an Army Iraq and Afghanistan veteran I want to be pissed at this guy because his challenge is running ultra marathons on a team that has personal masseuse!  But then I changed my point of view and realized that this guy is an expert in making money!  Did he run an ultra marathon on his own? No. Does he have any idea what it takes to run an ultra marathon on broken bones and kidney failure..No he doesn’t. Does the navy seal guy.....yup he does! But does the navy seal guy know how to market his efforts to make money everytime someone watches his video?....not as effectively as this guy or I would be hearing the Navy Seals guy version of the story.......which serves me as a reminder that we need to work smarter not harder!",7년 전,0,

But once it realized that it has only 1.2 miles left then it's said ""well, ok, we know you're going to be ok""  let me release the rest of the energy and let you finish the damn 1.2 miles.  There are many studies that proved this.  I'm sure you can google them if you're interested.

@jackmoody4024,"I had a similar experience. I saw a Seal swimming at the pool. He would disappear underwater for a good 10 minutes! He swam like a fish! My wife said that we should go talk to him. At first, he was standoffish, but finally, he started talking to my wife. She looked him up on facebook on the way home and he seemed very impressive.  Apparently, she decided to cold call him for me, because I came home from work and found him in my living room, the next week. This time, he was really talkative. I invited him to eat, and he laughed and said that he was starving! He ate nearly a whole bucket of KFC chicken, a container of mashed potatoes w/ gravy, and two pieces of Hershey pie.  We became instant friends and even my wife loved having him over. He was super loyal. I travel for work, and he would always tell me not to worry because he would take care of my wife while I was gone. Once, I came home early from a trip and found him sitting in a folding chair, with a bottle of water, eating a cherry toaster strudel and wearing a rob! I was terrified! I hate to say it, but I thought the worst. It turns out that my wife had a heard a noise the night before and he came over because she was scared. Lol  He was always positive and encouraging. He told us about the 40% rule and then said, if you want something, then take it! It really helped us. My wife started dressing better and taking care of herself. She would go to the gym 3 or 4 times a week for hours. It was great to see her so happy and looking good.  One night, I shared something very personal with the Seal. I admitted that we had been trying, unsuccessfully, to have a child for years. He told me that it was a mental block. He told me a few unusual things that I could try with my wife. To my surprise, she loved them. He said that I should always tell her, ""If it doesn't suck then I don't do it!"", so that she would give me oral pleasure. He said that I had to ""know"" that she would get pregnant. 40% wouldn't cut it! Then, he leaned over, looked at me with a 1,000 yard stare and said that he ""knew""  she would be pregnant soon. He walked away without another word.  When I came home the next day, he was at my house. He walked out and met me at the car and looked at me again with that crazy look and said the same thing before he left. He had stopped by, just to encourage me! Everyday, when I got home it was the same thing. He was always there just to tell me that he knew she would be pregnant. It was amazing.  Sure enough, he was right! When I found out, he was the first person that I called. He answered the phone in his normal way, ""Hoo Yah!"" and then sat silently. I told him the good news but he was silent. He just hung up. I guess he got shipped out, because we never saw him again.  My wife wanted to name our son after him, but we realized that we didn't know his name! We had always called him Seal! My son, now 15, is the strongest kid in his school and captain of the swim team. I honestly believe that he wouldn't be here today, if Seal hadn't came along to help us.

@jackmoody4024," @alinatahir6476  If you're a fan of ridiculously long comments, then here's another that I posted about the time I met Ted Nugent.  I met Ted several years ago. My wife became friends with his wife and they came over for dinner once. I had heard his music, but didn't know much about him. They arrived with a bottle of wine in hand. He was a really nice guy and we hit it off from the start. He had lots of great stories, a really warm demeanor and a funny laugh.    When we sat down for dinner, he started dishing meat on his plate. I said try some of my wife's brussels sprouts, but he said that he only ate meat. When he finished getting his food, there was almost no beef left. He had about 4 lbs of meat and he ate every bite. After dinner, my wife let our long haired Chihuahua out to visit. Ted picked up the tiny dog and held her gently, as he asked my wife the dogs name. She responded, ""That's miss ChaCha"". Ted laughed and stroked her fur as be baby talked her. It was funny to see him being so child like. We continued to drink and talk as Miss ChaCha went about her normal business, but she stayed close to Ted and eventually went to sleep next to his boot.  Then, Miss ChaCha woke up and got on the sofa next to Ted. He started petting her again as he talked to us. He kept saying that she was a beautiful little girl.    As they were leaving, Ted picked up Miss ChaCha and held her lovingly against his neck. I said, ""She really like you!"", as she softly licked his face. He smiled and held her close and said that she had a beautiful soul. She looked like she went into a trance as he held her. He gave her a gentle kiss on the head and carefully laid her on a pillow on the sofa. I reached over to pet her and Ted looked at me with a crazy but gentle smile and softly whispered, ""She's free now"". At first I thought he was joking and I started to laugh but then I realized that he had killed our dog with his hands!   He looked at me with a level of intensity that I have never seen, while still smiling, and said, ""Thank you"". My wife, in disbelief, picked up Miss ChaCha and started to cry. Ted gently put his hand on my wife's back and said, ""She's mine now"". All I could think was, oh shit! This crazy bastard just killed our Chihuahua and now he's going to take my wife. I tried to avoid eye contact as I said, ""Go easy Ted. I'm married to her"". For a second, he looked confused but then he smiled and started to laugh as he placed his hand firmly on my back.    He gently took Miss ChaCha's limp body from my wife's shaking hands. It was then that I realized that he had no intentions of taking my wife. I'll never forget the look of innocence and joy on his face as he said, ""Love transcends death"". Then he paused and sang the same words.  Neither my wife or I said a word. As he started out the door, still holding Miss ChaCha, he leaned over, kissed my wife's cheek and said, ""thank you for the beautiful trophy"".",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@michaelodonnell1900," @phallghuy  I'd tell him not to. It's water under the bridge, now. If it happened, it can't be undone. I was asked if I would like to have DNA done on my son to see if he should be considered qualified to receive benefits through the VA. I said, ""let me speak to him."" A few moments later he was on the phone and said, ""Yes daddy?"" I growled, ""WHAT DID YOU SAY?"" He answered with an innocent but tenative curiosity, ""I said, yes daddy."" I commanded him to give the phone back to those who'd availed me of the test option. He obeyed and, I was asked, ""well, do you want to have the test or not."" I asked, ""did you hear him?"" The reply was, ""yes."" I said, ""That's your proof that he's my son. Now, give my son the benefits!"" Why fuck-up the good that may have come from a bad situation?",6년 전,0,
@michaelodonnell1900," @Bryant201  Maybe, he's got no balls and, the SEAL provided them a child they'd have never, otherwise, had. This would be the reciprocal of the ancient times custom of a Servant bearing a child for a barren woman. The Bible says, ""he who commits adultery with another man's wife is an utter fool... I don't get the impression of SEALs being Jody's. I see labeling them as such to be as equating them to being utter fools. If it did happen, the SEAL's silence- when informed of the pregnancy- was, probably, due to it being the end of the arrangement. 15 years later and, they've one child, still! The wife's not a cheating hoe or they'd be more. She no-longer has a ""barren womb."" A ""barren womb (childless)"" is known to be a torment or curse. This doesn't fit the ""Jody"" character. There's, also, the Biblical mandate that if your brother dies without his wife bearing him a child you're to impregnate her with a son so that his name can be carried-on. There's an Oriental proverb that says, ""when something goes to the extreme, it takes-on the appearance of it's opposite."" There's at-least one alternate explanation for the SEAL's interaction with that couple. Another would be the power of faith. The Bible says, ""if you have the faith of a mustard seed you could say to the mountain be removed to the sea and, it would."" So, it could be the husband's child and that, he's never had another without the SEAL's prayer and faith to bring it to fruition. I do believe in the potential for miracles. The Bible speaks of Christian's doing even greater things than Jesus did when He was alive.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

You really have no clue what pushing yourself does & its sad because when pushing yourself you can learn a lot about who you are or what kind of person you are.

@warmonger9100," weejams  the Navy has only two required weigh-ins. Twice a year and it has nothing to do with performance but with health and the cost of obesity. Naval Special Warfare does not do anything more, then then Naval requirement for weight. Unless you are attending military free fall or conducting parachute operations, then you are not being weighted. Running long distance, has nothing to do with being fast. If you run a 8 min mile, you are only running forty yards every 10 to 15 seconds. That is not fast. If individuals need to be fast, then they have to generate power. To generate power, the individual must use speed and strength. This why, Naval Special Warfare, introduces SEAL and SWCC candidates to powerlifting during the NSW Prep course. Then NSW spend 3.2 million a year, funding the human performance at every command. They focus on developing power, through power lifting. No, they do not weight 300 pounds. They do on average carry more muscle, then anyother branch of service or other special operations team. It's not uncommon, to see a guy walking around at 225 to 260 pounds and hold 10 to 12 percent body fat. You have to fast, take punishment and  deliver punishment.

@warmonger9100," weejams  there's a lot more then just surf torture. Try running the mile from the barracks to the pool, then swimming for three hours. Then running a mile to the beach, then doing pullups and dips for an hour. Then run the five miles from the beach to the demo pits and back. Then run the o-course five times for time. Then you have surf passage, for the next hour or two. Then log PT for an hour or two. On Fridays you either run the 10 miles to the North Island gate or 15 miles to the elephant cages and back. In-between that, you eat and if there's down time, they punish you. The run to and from the galley is two miles. That's six miles, of running, just to eat your food. After the day ends, around 6 or 7, you have to get your room ready for inspection, get your uniforms ready for inspection, and get your gear ready for inspection. That usually takes to midnight, then you start the day over at 5am. The surf torture is the easy part, hence why people quit on it. Oh and don't forget the week, you do all that and sleep only two hours a night. Yes, there is a hell of a lot more then surf torture. I didn't even add PT or the scheduled 2 hour beat downs or when they punish you, by running the day turns into night evolutions  because the class upset the instructors. I",6년 전,0,

@Ironbuket,"I think a lot of people are aware they have a lot more in them when they give up. Most people would stop doing pull ups when their arms hurt so much they cant do anymore, because they realise that is your body telling you that if you continue you are likley to do damage. Can you continue through the pain barrier, yep sure. Should you, that is where your interlect should kick in and say hang on a second let me weigh up the pros and cons of this situation. Do I want to lose the use of my arms for the next few days just to prove to this guy im not a wimp. The more inteligent person would realise they dont have to prove anything to anyone. Im sure the guy that continued running with broken toes feels really tough. He probably eitehr gets a kick out of impressing others or just enjoys pushing his limits for its own sake. Personally Id rather not break all my toes in the first place, but if I did I wouldnt grind up the bits just to prove how tough i was. Combat situations are completely different as giving up = death. In civilian life there is no need to keep the same mindset. If you want to live your life as if everything is life and death, go join the army and do it for real.  The other factor gone unmentioned is AGE. When you are a young recruit in the army getting this training about ignoring your limits you can easily bounce back from going way past your limits. When you get older, going way past your limits can result in injury that can last weeks/months to recover from. If you are in your 50s or older you could end up killing yourself.

@Jaffa_MD,"I probably agree with the fact that our minds give up before our bodies are truly done, but I disagree with the reasoning behind hitting ""the wall"" and pushing through it.

This is a problem because that wall exists for a reason.  Beyond that wall, the body starts to break.  Breaking the body every once in a while is fine, but it was a problem for me because I was breaking my body every day.  I had to train myself to NOT push beyond that wall.  I had to train my body to tell my mind that it hit the wall, because my body wasn't sending the signal.  Point is I'm weird.

@jackbrown3958,"Your video inspired me to write the following comment…  Never stop pushing your body and mind to the limits of what other people are willing to watch you subject yourself to and you will be standing, running, lifting (etc.) more than most people. I'm overweight but yet I can push harder (endurance) than all of my friends/family/etc., why? Because I know that mentally I can push my physically weaker body harder/longer than a weaker-minded person can push their strong bodies.   There's at least four key aspects to true strength (IMHO):  • Mental Strength: To me this is someone’s capability to keep trying until they achieve their goal no matter what (""the master has failed many more times than the novice has ever tried""). For example, I had the mental will power to stop smoking cold turkey after many years of smoking 1-2 packs a day. I didn't plan it and I didn't think about it before I committed. I just made up my mind to do so, and I did (for my health).  • Mental tolerance: Most people will not subject them self to something they physically/mentally can’t stand/tolerate (“keep your friends close and you enemies closer”). Most people will start to feel physical pain and metal suffering if they try to but some people like the people who walk/run across hot coals can and do have exceptional mental tolerance for things others would say is not possible. For example, I intentionally subjected myself to things I could not normally tolerate (ice water swimming, running in -40c, long distance bike riding in 45c heat, pushing on with a broken bone, etc.) to build up my mental tolerance to the unbearable.  • Physical Strength: We all know this one so no explanation/interpretation is needed. For example, I recently had to do a stress test for my heart at the hospital and I was worried because the doctor told me not to stop until I couldn't physically go anymore. I pushed my body so hard that the doctor was forced to terminate the stress test once I hit a sustained 220 BPM. I simply never gave up mentally or physically because I never planned to. I could have kept on going until I passed out.   • Physical tolerance: Each person’s physical tolerance is different and I think of it like an immune system that can be improved with proper training/practice (like people who run marathons/triathlons or hold their breath for extended amount of time underwater). For example, I once knew a kick boxer who would break 2x4's and eventually cinder blocks with his shin to build up his physical tolerance for hard kicks to the shin. It's key to be able to tolerate any and all aches & pain in order to keep pushing on when others would stop. I would regularly push my body to the point where I’ll pass out or vomit and over time my body’s tolerance/endurance increased and eventually this limit was harder and harder to reach.  My trick is to put my mind in a state of mental Zen (a happy place if you will) combined with a physical tempo/beat/rhythm (heart rate, breathing rate, and movement rate need to have a synchronicity). Another thing that sets me apart from most is the fact that I only believe in myself. Call it selfish or egotistical but I truly believe that anything I put my mind to I can do if I try my hardest and never EVER give up within reason of course (I can’t win the lottery no matter how hard I try at it). The only time I make an exception is for loved ones out of respect and understanding that they have a sincere concern for my personal health/well-being. Many people at gym’s have warned me that my method is a very unhealthy practice so I’ve been on a permanent hiatus from gym (when someone gives you sound advice you take it). I’m far from perfect but I always gave/give my all.  Disclaimer: Please do not try what I’ve mentioned above as it could put your body/mind at serious risk of permanent harm or even death. For example, when I was young (16-18) I thought I could build my tolerance to the cold but once you get frostbite you’re more susceptible the having frostbite again and again. So it’s important to keep in mind that the body can’t build tolerance to everything. Also, proper techniques & training by a professional and medical advice from a doctor is always essential/necessary before trying to expand your “true strength”. Be safe not foolish!

These athletes who have been training for a very long time to specifically run in a marathon actually finish the marathon?! What if we grabbed a few thousand random people off the street one day, bussed every one to a marathon starting line, and fired the starter pistol? Who want's to talk percentages now?

@YeshuaAgapao,"Marathon or any other endurance event - you must operate within your aerobic capacity especially in the first 30 minutes (varies by training background and recent diet).  If you are burning anaerobically, you will bonk as the carbs flame-out (fat doesn't burn well anaerobically), which makes you feel awful and get the strong urge to quit. The general concept is staying within a range o percentage of VO2-max. Not well versed in anti-quit cheats for weight exercises (pull ups are a gravity weight exercise) though if you are already able to handle the weight very well, then the pace regulation techniques may still work.   I think if you splice the science and monitoring used in professional sports (soccer especially) with the mental toughness already in military training, you can maximize the gains without overdoing it   (breaking all the foot bones and frying the kidneys - likely from severe dehydration and electrolyte depletion - might have pre-existing damage from uncontrolled diabetes also).  All the monitoring they do in professional sports is to adjust the work levels of the players.  Some are under-efforting, but most are over-exerting, over-efforting and going over the ideal performance-growth VO2-max percentage range.  Soccer is not as straightforward as cycling or rowing though as soccer needs a lot of sprint burts.  Though i think it was nerfed, but I think the US water polo team did fairly well in mock seal training.  Their bodies are pre-conditioned for cold water though and water polo is a low-fame high-determination sport. I don't think the US national soccer team will do nearly as well.    High school sports going hard to weed out the quitters is not that dangerous barring drug use or severe diet/hydration problems.   Elite sports and military, going hard to weed out the quitters without vitals and other monitoring (all that magic computer stuff about every pro coach on the team uses nowadays) can be dangerous - seal candidates getting stress fractures that slowly grow into full-on fractures and keep on going...   (think after the halway point of hell week, almost all drop-outs are medical force-outs) Not sure if any died during training, but performance enhancing substance use is on the rise in the military.  Most sudden cardiac deaths are from abuse of such substances, or from prescription drugs (often legit), or the interaction or side-effect compounding of multiple drugs/supplements.",8년 전(수정됨),0,

@sportcowan1939,"""the wall"" in a marathon is actually  a real limit on how much time you can go for an extended period of time. It's the time when your muscles cannot do any more strenuous activity,  so you have to slow down to a pace that you can hold for significantly longer. You've  long passed the 40% have to push yourself threshold. For example, my dad did a marathon at 17 years old,  and he got roughly 3 hours and 3 minutes. However,  at 2 hours 15, he was on pace to run under 2 hours 50. He didn't get slower because he gave up,  he got slower because his cells couldn't carry out cellular respiration fast enough to hold the pace he was going any longer.  Elites don't hit the wall because their race ends before the wall happens.",8년 전,0,

However the world that this man lives in, ""once a year marathon""  the fact that he took a massage therapist (or multiple) with him on a run. Or that he can just fly across the country (or state)  on a whim and ask a complete stranger to live with him, presumably offering him some incentive. At the least room and board. This all shows that he lives in a world many of us can not relate to. My wife is an RN I'm a custom artist and together we make just shy of 100k a year. It would never occur to us to bring a masseur to a marathon. We've run a few marathons the past 3 years, tough mudder, color me rad, run for leukemia, so I'm not inexperienced with them and I understand people run for different reasons, but while his message is clear and inspiring I wonder how much he can convey, or how much he was able to grasp and then impart to us when he lives a life where he can sell a ""few""  businesses (I have just the one) and can't do more than 8 pull ups. Not that many people can. And by can I mean do 8 pull ups and also relate to his situation.

@-John-Doe-,"1. Watch David Goggins on Joe Rogan’s podcast. He’s the Seal in this story.   He talks about feeling like a failure in life, weighing 300 lbs, and using your pain as motivation.  2. This guy isn’t explaining the mindset well at all, in my opinion. The point is that you can train yourself to identify doubt, and condition your mind to push way beyond that point.  We tell ourselves what we can do. We allow ourselves to quit. We put these stories up in our mind that limit what we’re capable of. If you feel like quitting, throw more on top of it to kill those thoughts. You can learn to overcome.  ”Failure is not an option” is bullshit. Failure is always an option. It’s the only option in life.   You need to learn to identify when you’re quitting or looking for an out. You need to train yourself to identify that, and immediately react to it.  Use that mindset next time you go for a run. Doing a short run to get ready for a 5k? — Make it a 5k. Do 10k. When that doubt enters your mind, put that option out of reach.  If there’s anything you don’t want to do, You need to do that. Your mind is telling you exactly what you need.  Jordan Peterson sometimes touches on the same points in regards to having a ‘calling’ in life. That can be a curse, because if you don’t answer your inner judge, it can literally kill you. You have to overcome fear in life, constantly.  If you let your fears and anxieties hold you back, they will destroy you. Your life will be filled with depression and regret. You need to fight that. You need to fight through that.  There is some fucked up shit you’ve locked away in your mind. Shit that we don’t want to confront. You need to go in those dark places and slug it out with some demons. They’ll eat you alive if you don’t.  That’s not a fight we pick. Shit haunts us. Those demons pick us. You don’t have a choice but to go through them, and you can’t put it off. It’s terrifying and daunting but you don’t have a choice. Either you do it, or you let your doubt destroy you.  The problem is, the reluctant man is driven to action, only when the pain of inaction eclipses the pain of action.  This isn’t short term motivation. This is conditioning your mind over and over to get through things that suck.",7년 전(수정됨),1,

@gregorypdearth,"I learned something similar in the Army. Pain is weakness leaving the body. I entered basic as a weakling. My stats were laughable. I thought I made a big mistake. But I learned to embrace discomfort and pain and draw power from my will to work through it. When my body wanted me to stop I consciously fought that urge, often an overwhelming feeling of inevitable limits, and found I had a LOT more to give. Even when I reached what we call muscle failure, where I thought I physically just couldn't do more, I started realizing that this was a safety limit for my body that was too conservative. I never got stronger until I learned to dominate these instinctive urges to stop and push through them. Then I started getting better really quickly, meeting the standards in a few weeks and finally exceeding them by a bit. For a guy that couldn't do 7 push-ups going in, and certainly someone that hated athletics (still do), it was enlightening to realize my body could do what I wanted even when all the signals it is sending my brain would have previously discouraged me from even trying to break that wall.",8년 전,2,

@CallMeStrange1,"Essentially. Look at how animals in general evolved: eat, reproduce, survive. Anything that doesn't help with that is tosses aside and abandoned. Consider humans: we are mammals of the hominid genus, therefore we are great apes in the broader family of monkeys (to put EXTREMELY simply). Humans spend the majority of our time indoors, in cool temperatures, sitting down; minimal energy expenditures. At the end of the day we want to be wealthy both financially and nutritionally. This means that we want to do as little as possible to get the maximum of sustenance to facilitate survival, nutritional gain, and as many reproduction opportunities as possible( though some of use will deny that). Our minds are wired to get the maximum payout with as little energy as possible. In a marathon situation, that mindset is being put to the test. We are putting ourselves in such a huge energy deficit that our minds are telling us, from a GENETIC LEVEL, to just FUCKING STOP and rest or otherwise end energy expenditure. It is only when we tell our self no that we really see how our higher level mental processing helps us. We can tell our unconscious, animal-istic self to shut the hell up an let us get on with whatever we want to do. Lower order animals can't actively do that outside of life or death situations.  Many of us have this ability, but rarely do we use it. Even then, only those who actively put themselves in these situations, such as soldiers or athletes, can really claim mastery over it. People in war torn parts of our world can also claim that they master it, due to the extreme nature of where they live and the necessity to overcome what their unconscious mind is telling them to survive. However, people in industrialized and post-industrialized nations dont have many in their population that can claim they have what it takes to get through these types of situations and mean it.",8년 전,3,

@ashscott6068,"Frank  And you don't even find it Ironic that the real circle-jerk here is the people defending a quick fix soloution to the problem of hard work. They've probably put no real focused effort into anything in their lives, and now a video is selling them a ""secret"". Meanwhile, all the other people out there who can do ""incredible"" things are out there just DOING them and not finding them a huge mental barrier to overcome. They have a word for this""wall"". It's the same one we all use: ""Discomfort"". nothing more. How much money did you pay into this scam? Sounds like buyers remorse to me. I'm not saying people can't run 100 miles. People do it all the time, and there's nothing remarkable about a time of 19 hours. And guess what...the ones who train to do it, do it. And a guy off the street can't do it. There is literally nothing his brain can do to alter that fact. There is no ""secret"". It's a damn sorry state of affairs when a bit of hard work is such a mystery to so many people, that people can sell mystical mental bullshit. Training to run 100 miles is hard. Sitting cross legged and going ""Ommmm"" is easy. Sparring for long periods is hard. Trying to develop ""chi"" is easy (Physically easy anyway, since it doesn't exist)  If you're watching this video intending to improve yourself, then you're clearly just that type of person that keeps falling for this sort of stuff. There's no secret. Some shit is damn uncomfortable. Deal with it, or don't do that shit. There's the ""secret"" completely free of charge.

If you have water and food and mental motivation you can keep moving muscles until the nerve signals and chemical reactions don't move them anymore, wait until they recover, and do it again to that point over and over, but that's not showing we have more energy than we thought. It's like a solar device being charged not a deceptively large gas tank lol.

@Pendrym,"Quote: 'He had broken all the small bones in both of his feet and had kidney damage and he finished the race.' WHO THE FUCK CARES THAT HE FINISH THE RACE? if truly someone does something so stupid and you take him a as model, you are even more stupid! A real win is taking things in the long term, so doing the race and work on your health as well. More specifically, train in the right way takes time but brings you forward without paying a ultimate cost that will slow you done and stop you even before your time. Take another runner who maybe does not finish that race. He keeps on training, and slowly improves until over the years he can do this and other races without really feeling bad or having any health issues. The Seal would have already stopped running by then, and just be unable to do almost anything anymore.",8년 전,0,

@jean-claudefrancoisbaroudd730,"This works well for physical feats apparently, but does it actually work for your brain ? Because your brain isn't a muscle and you can't train it as such. (Despite what a lot of ""advice givers"" will tell you..) Because when my brain tells me I can't fuckin study anymore, I can push myself, but I won't learn anything, it's not efficient. And I don't need physical advice, I run Semi-Iron Mans and the only reason I don't run the full one is because I'm too slow on the marathon so I wouldn't finish before the 17h.. I could ""push myself"" but I won't make it under 17h. Fact. So I should train more, well yes maybe, but I don't have the time so no. And it's bullshit anyway, say your brain tells you ""I'm done"" on km 21, and you push to km 42: let's say you're a bit used to it and your brain quits at 50%; is it linear ? Because if it is you're done at 42km. But that means the 40% rule is false at that point ? 40% rule is stupid, it suggests it's like a Poisson distribution.. So your brain tells you you're done at 42km but it's actually 50% so you can run another 42km, then you get to 84km and your brain tells you this time I'm done, but it's actually 50% so you can run another 84km.

Why not just talk to him at the treck, make a phone call for gods sake, why waste so much time on a this guy when you could have just spoken to him when you met first? 3) you're claiming to know, in depth, the mindset and mental tools of navy seal training, from one guy.

I think that breaking  bones and getting irreversible kidney damage is just your own fault and responsibility for not listening to what the body is telling the mind. SEALs shut their emotions down so in theory they don't need motivation to get the job done, exactly what the army is looking for. However, a SEAL always has a goal or mission he has to complete. Injuring yourself (as a sacrifice) in order to complete the mission is therefor sometimes neccesary, and this is where a SEALs life and a normal 'civilian' life differ. I would never give myself a burnout, mental breakdown or any other mental or physical injury for the company I'm working for, to reach my goal.

@sbreheny,"Overall, I agree with Duckman1616 but to give the seal the benefit of the doubt - he may not have realized at the time that the pain in his feet was due to broken bones and also it is likely that the kidney damage was not permanent. It is fairly common for people who really push themselves running to have some degree of Rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown) after the run. If this is significant, then it will impair your kidney function for a few hours - less if you drink enough water. If you really, really overdid it you might have some residual permanent damage but the greater risk is the blood chemistry derangement which happens temporarily while your kidneys aren't working properly. It can sometimes bring on heart arrhythmias.",8년 전,2,

A broken bone is not at all related to a muscle growth, a broken bone is more like a broken muscle which I think is called a muscle tear.  Muscle can be very slightly ""damaged"" in order to grow bigger but not bones nor skin... If you break a bone or if have a huge cut on the skin it will NEVER be as hard as before, some very big cuts can re open many times and for no apparent reasons, sometimes even years after....Your bones that already broke will break more and more easily each time u break them.  So here is the important thing, muscle take some damage and become stronger, it CAN BE TRUE, it is not true, it just can be because of it highly depends on the damage you take, is it controled damage done by working out properly ? or is it a muscle tear ?

The only way I could see that KIND OF be a possibility is if someone lit a fire under his ass while he did it. The adrenaline rush alone would probably give him 1-2 more at MOST.,8년 전,14,
@SpencerAt6,"Just to clear this up, the pull up story isn't bullshit. He never said he was hanging from the bar firstly. Secondly, your ATP-PC (to put simply your fast, explosive energy) system does restore very quickly but won't provide long term energy. It won't let him repeatedly do sets of eight or 10, but one pull up then 30 seconds rest, then one more pull up? No problem. Try it yourself.",8년 전,8,
@MsMi321,"Thing is you will end up ripping your muscles apart, you may have the energy for it but structual fatigue takes its toll. Thing is once a month this isnt an issue. Do this weekly or daily and you are setting yourself up for permanent damage, tendinitis. etc. Its a way to train the will, just dont train your will beyond what is healthy for you. Slow and steady progression means peaking later, but that peak lasts longer and wont leave you with injuries ad you will fall less from your peak.",8년 전,4,
@KingNefiiria,"MsMi321 That's only if you try to do it all at once. You can do 100 pushups in an hour, or 100 all at once. Guess which one isn't going to tear your muscles up? Your body recovers very quickly when doing things over a long period of time.",8년 전,1,
@MsMi321,"Terra Estrahl thing is, 100 push ups and lets say you can only do 10. No matter how long you take to do those push ups it will destroy your musvles, less than doing them all at once. but still the damage is dealt.  This is what stractual fatigue is, that if I take say a thin metal straw and bend it enough times, NOTE the amount is important here not the intensity, then the straw will eventually break.   Our muscles are made of collagen fibers, and thin and thick fillaments namely myosin and actin. These bands exert tremendous amounts of force on each other when they contract aka the power stroke (Where myosin grabs the actin and pulls the Z lines towards each other ZZline being the ends of the sarcomere or for simplicities sake lets call it the mechanical unit).  Contracting them too many times over a period of time where there is relatively constant exertion wil lead to tears, breakage and is in general just classified as overusage. But as I said doing this once a month is fine, as your body has 29 more days to recover as well as develop from this. Our bodies do not really recover directly after excercise, we do most of our recovery during sleep, hence why many athletes must get enough sleep in order to function at any sort of competetive level. As melatonin is released and the body begins its essentially ritualistic repair cycle.   AKA: Medically speaking this advice of goign so far above your max that its going to ruin you for the day or even week is bad advice if done daily. One should be able to do at least half of their goal for this sort of exersion to at least be able to recover in time to get back to normal training without causing injury if they are going to apply this.   ALSO NOTE: there seems to be this utter musconception that training hard and suffering is a good thing when in fact the body needs to slowly adjust to whats happening. The slower the adjustment often times it seems the beter, as the body then is able to handle the load much more effectively as all necessary adaptations have occured as well as the fact that the person is used to the load being exertedon their mind, body and nervous system. (Yes this system is also at risk in overexertion)",8년 전,3,
@KingNefiiria,"MsMi321 I'm talking about an average person with an average build. Not someone who's so malnourished and anorexic that they need an intervention and assistance to get back to a normal life, or someone who's so overweight that they have a belly that flabs over their groin. An average person could easily do 100 push ups in an hour.  Let's stop adding in extremes on either side, now, and focus on the average population.  If someone did 5 push ups for 20 seconds, and then rested for a minute, they could pull off 100 in 40 minutes. That's a 20 minute buffer to rest, if trying to max out that 1 hour mark. People are not that week. My 6 year old brother could pull off 100 push ups in an hour.",8년 전,0,

One was doing paperwork at a police station when a random bad guy broke in seeking revenge on officers and killed them instead. The other was gunned down in friendly fire after a drug bust because other agents were too panicked. And although what others were saying weren't really plotting; more like random scenarios, even talking about crimes can land you in court. There was this weird case of an internet chatroom where a bunch of creeps would talk about infant child porn canabalism. I don't think there were any pictures or abuse or kidnappings or anything.

@djsubliminalreeve,i train like this all the time doing weights but fuck training like that with running especially with a little bit of water cause you will get rhabdomyolysis. i had it once from doing a jog for 2.5 hours i actually forgot my water bottle at home and then i pissed out blood and was so worried. this rule only applies without stupidity so remember to stay hydrated and not train through severe pain as you could end up having to get surgery to fix an injury.,8년 전,0,

Honestly, this 40% thing is the shittiest advice that you can get when it comes to training. Even if there is some truth behind it, yes you HAVE to push your self over your limit to get progress, that much is true, but you shouldn't do it with your body like that if you don't have to. Seals are NOT(!) good role models for the average joe! They do this kind of thing with a purpose, they are soldiers meant to function under extreme conditions, so their training and mental state is extreme. But ask your self this. Why are there no 60 year old dudes in SEAL? You can do a lot of things with your body, doesn't mean you should do it. You're not a SEAL, so there is no reason to think, breath, train and live like SEAL. Doesn't mean that you can't learn something from them.",8년 전,19,

@RandomVidz690,"So many things wrong with this video and and it's quite annoying that it's misleading and misinforming so many people on the level of mental/physical fortitude SEALs and the particular SEAL Jesse is talking about display. So let this be the comment that ends all stupid comments.   First of all, the man Jesse is referring to in the video as ""seal"" is Navy SEAL David Goggins. He is a civilian now and was a civilian at the time this video was released, so it really doesn't make much sense at to why he keeps referring to him as ""seal"". It's not only misleading but quite annoying.  Second, the race that Jesse and David ran in where he broke the bones in his feet/had kidney failure was a 100 mile race; a race that is intended to be broken up by multiple people. David ran the entire race by himself. This is why he experienced some adverse effects.  Third, to those of you saying David is ""stupid"" for not listening to his body when he had kidney failure and broke the bones in his feet, this is EXACTLY what's supposed to happen in these type of races (also known as ""ultramarathons""). Many of you have also stated that David will have ""permanent health problems"" following this and this makes him stupid, when this couldn't be farther from the truth. Kidney failure (despite what it sounds like) is something that heals relatively quickly (if treated correctly) and does not leave permanent effects.  Fourth, to those of you questioning David's credibility and saying that he's ""stupid"" and ""doesn't know what he's talking about"" since he split his kidney in a race, David has been running ultramarathons for 10+ years, was a Navy SEAL, runs 100+ miles a week, and has written multiple award-winning books on running, endurance, nutrition, etc. The fact that you think you know more than him (considering he is practically the father of ultra long distance running) is absolutely laughable.

Our body can't support that if you overdo that lifestyle and literally breaks at some point.

When you're running in a hot weather and your body is so under stress that you can hear your heart beat in your ears, take a break and cool down your body, you don't wanna die from heat stroke just because you want to endure a little longer for bragging rights. Under life or death situation, human body is capable of unimaginable things but that should not mean you should push to that limit in everyday activities. There is a limit for a reason, to preserve oneself. Every problem has a more rational and smart way to approach it. I do see the value of hardship and training soldiers put themselves through to prepare them for every situation; but for a common Joe, simple regular exercise everyday and focusing on the mental and skill development would be far more  better path.

@goldkencaddle5500,"You both have good points.   It is worth it to watch the video and make you own decisions, but overall I think that awareness of your own limits, not your habits, but actual limits beyond which you would cause damage, is discouraged in favor of taking more robotic options. It is not that robots will steal jobs, but rather, being robotic is now seen as superior to being a human, and being smart, and saying no to some things.   Preparing for a marathon and running it is a great hobby; but organizing a marathon and profiting financially from it is smarter. You could even do both.   Smarter, also, is using your time to work out how to afford a car, or bicycle.   Less impressive to those who worship sacrifice, but I think in order to really use our full potential, we have to use what we have to get what we want, rather than abuse ourselves to get what might impress some, might inspire some, but hurts ourselves in the process -- unnecessarily.   Addictions come in all forms, and addiction to goal achievement hides two related, but harder (mentally, emotionally) skills: goal-setting (choosing the right goals for you) and renegotiation (altering a plan when circumstances change), both parts of integrity.

They act just like us heterosexuals except with the opposite gender. One of my friends you would never guess he was gay, he behaved as a normal guy would.

I recently experienced a very close friend who I have known for years. He is an avid evangelical christian who said that he struggled with his attraction to men. He has never acted on it because of his Christian beliefs. Even if he had it would not change my friendship with him. My friend has spent many a night in my home and has always been a perfect gentleman towards my wife and son. I trust him implicitly with my son and family. I can't imagine what it would be like to be him, but I can say he is one of the most self disciplined persons I know and my hats off to him. PS he is perfectly fine with his rejection of his attraction to men and his embracement of Christianity and acting on his moral convictions.

I'm absolutely positive he shuns behavior like such as what the lives of those you stated ergo them living in damnation for eternity, Some think nothing will happen to them because after death theirs nothing,but I feel after death, things aren't going to be pretty for that individual. God will throw all kind of trails at that man or woman. Hell will not be fire and brimstone. But another go at life. A different sort of life. A new experience for the same dude. Same base consciousness yet different life, which would lead to a new set of choices. .. God will put him into a position of choice. Much like the one's giving on earth but for higher consequences. Which if your familiar with the basic ideals of our religions is unbelievable. Hell is the be all end all of bad places to be. God is all powerful, God can. and probably did, made something actually worse than hell. Made for those who do even worse in hell. Good gave man free will, yet made us in his own image.. Fucked up if your born with disease. More fucked up for those who will be more willing to do rotten things, not repent, and go to hell, all because god presented this boy/woman with that particular life. With those ideals, those parents. Those friends. Those enemies, those desires.. If god created everything he created bad people right? wrong!. Good created sin. Yet he didn't create sinful men. He created men, and gave them them the choice to be righteous or take the choice to embrace sin, which many do. If god is all loving and purposeful, why give all those shit people the option to do shitty things. its because in that moment in time was the consequences were higher for the shit head than it was for the victim, in hindsight..  The message to people was, do good and i'll hook you up(God speaking).. Don't and Imma see to it that you rest eternally in a play i made out of fairy dust to make you suffer for as long as you can perceive time. of course Imagine if you will, a man shoots a women i an attempt to rob her of her belongings., She's dead. Her husband finds out  when he has to identify the body(he stole her wallet). He throws up from the sadness but it get worse. at the same time finds out his unborn child he didn't know about, until now, will never breath air. At this moment This mans life has changed forever. He will not find life for years, he won't love until he is strong enough, and has found a woman he can feel a connection like he had to the one he lost, that or better. His life might be ruined if he doesn't make the right choices, but theres a reason why its called being strong. All this pain, all of this change, this reality was he lived in was destroyed. And now Its up to him to rebuild. He can rebuilt stronger. It just takes time, and courage .We humans were made to survive, God just put us into a position that when you rebuild will you be weaker or a better man..All that it  meant for the killer was a cellphone and a couple bills. Sounds so one sided in the grand scheme of things. One man loses everything and  is forced into a world without the one he loves most, all because the actions of someone who had so little to gain. Yet in truth its the opposite. If you believe in happy endings, I'n a hundred years give or take, the the two lovers will reunite in heaven. A man meets his son, and the family lives countless lives together, God will grant them stuff they wish for because god isa nice dude, he's cool like that, and they will be happy together, Forever. however for mister shooty bang bang. in a billion years, if he still hasn't caught on to not be a dick and redeemed his soul. he will still live in EVER GROWING torment.  If god was thought as a supercomputer, he would be a all seeing all MOVING cpu generating infinite sequences of AI; Humans. And sets up a life simulating rng machine.Stuff happens and sometimes you have to roll for results.the rng being who YOU are and how you reaction ACCORDINGLY.  Do good good things happen, do bad and the worst thing that can possibly enter your reality, will, and you will have to face it until you get the fucking clues. life happens. No one thinks their the bad guy in their mind. Only after having the most surreal palpable way of seeing your actions replay over and over and fuckin learning from your mistakes, will you find gods love. It was there all along, you just didn't see it.. Having the revelation of the one who you are, isn't acceptable, and should be change is hard for a few reasons./ having the ability to redeem one's self should be prominent. No one should make the same mistake.until their eyes bleed, After you revelate from the knowledge you were supposed to and COULD have felt. You live a peaceful life. Help a few people out. Do what you enjoy and what you were called for, and die a good death. Be proud in the waiting room and get ready for heaven. If he fails again he goes deeper into the rabbit hole and face an EVEN worse reality. Hence living in another ""earth"" with a different ""god"" and a even worse ""hell""  If god really loves us he wouldn't give us a personally e-mail to prove he exists. He  would make an entire universe, and in some small way, make it revolve around us. Its up to you to live in this era, and try and fight a world created by humans. When weak get power that take it from everyone, so they never have to feel weak again, and they fucking did it!!! Just be good and work hard.Hopefully If the world doesn't fix itself, god will send some one or give us a sign ""sarcastical  wink""",9년 전,0,

Unless he was operating heavy machinery or lifting heavy things there is no reason for a soldier to walk around at 260pounds unless that's his natural frame, which is abnormal/giant-tier. It requires too much food to maintain and causes too much damage to joints, muscle tendons and bones when running long distances and walking downhill etc. Pro-tip when making up stories to sell crap books of no value: make sure everything is plausible and don't make up random numbers about some ripped gay dude you sucked off at the marathon.

@BenKingEagles,"It's not your brain (as I assume you mean, ie. your physical computer) telling you that you can't do anymore, it's a collection of things, like fears, ego, self-image, and so on. This video has an interesting message, but here's an easier one:  When you think you can't run any longer, or can't do another push up or curl, etc. ... do 1-2 more and stop. If you are doing a bootcamp, or training and get to the end of your 8/10/12 reps... again do 1-2 more and stop. Tell yourself you can do it, make it happen and over time you will see how much more capable you are. It's a very simple and effective way to break one of our most omnipresent mental barriers.  The ""voice"" telling you that you cannot run any more is NOT a serious physical defense system, it's just your own bs getting in the way because you are doing something difficult and most of us have a fairly strong inclination to NOT stress ourselves, even when we specifically think we have set out to stress ourselves.  Special forces around the world use this basic technique to train their soldiers to find the extra energy and willpower they have, but do not know how to access. For most of us plebs, accessing another 60% is unrealistic and actually could be dangerous if we don't do it properly, but doing just a little more each time... that's relatively easy and it can have an incredible effect on how you live your life.",9년 전,2,

@Durzo1259,"Honestly I see this video doing more harm than good. Navy SEAL's are the last example you should be giving people for advice on discipline, motivation and accomplishment... not when it comes as a general catch-all philosophy for anybody and everybody. Most people don't understand how the spec-ops approach is way more likely to be a giant detriment than a help.  I've loved studying all special forces for years, learning about tapping into super-human endurance and discipline (because I've had to); got massive respect for them. But this kind of approach only works for the minority alpha-male types who have unusually-high testosterone, healing abilities and exceptional biological mechanisms to compensate for damage.   Lots of people, including and especially me, had our own ""40%"" philosophy of refusing to acknowledge limits while always pushing them farther to make them extend further. I did this when I was 16-18 so I could be the best at Judo and Army Cadets and learn strength and confidence for all life's challenges. Always figured ""If I really injure myself from pushing it too hard that'll suck, but I can handle the pain and that just means I'll be out of commission for weeks or months instead of days"".  That thinking rings true for guys who turn into Rangers and NFL stars. For the rest of us - the literally tens of millions per year who thought the same - we ended up with crippling, permanent chronic pain that literally destroyed the rest of our entire lives. It's during those days of foolish youth that you don't realize that some body parts - like spinal disks made of cartilage - literally can't heal or regrow.

@penitent2401,"that mental barrier is there to protect the body from damage, many professional athletes also describe hitting a pain barrier when they work and then continue to push past that and the pain fades away. For the average person this is dangerous to do as it basically shuts down the protective barriers our brain has set up and go into survival mode but under watch (like with a professional coach who can see when too much  damage is going to happen) it does allows them to train harder, longer and achieve more in shorter time. Many soldiers are trained to push past this barrier because in combat situation their lives can depend on it and the price they pay in damage to their bodies is acceptable compared to not able to function in middle of battle.  Just remember there is a huge price to pay for going above this barrier regularly, it's only meant to be crossed in fight or flight scenarios that happens a few times in a life time. many professional athletes have burnt themselves out in their 30s and getting told they can never play their sport again.",9년 전,0,

Severe burn-out syndrome, anxiety attacks, depression, took me a year to get back to lead at least a partially normal life and for my mind to recover. Your mind tells you that you had enough for a reason. Maybe you can get away with pushing yourself too hard 99 out of 100 times.

I'd look at every recess in the sand and try to talk myself into 'just putting down there and no one would know'. But what got me over the dune was the thought of small progress. Walk 20 feet and rest. Then another 20 and rest.

There is a reason why your body complains if it is not used to heavy duty labor or exercise.  I can do about 20 push-ups all at once in one go. However, if I spread them out over the course of an entire day, I could do 600 (60 sets of 10 ). However those 600 are worthless and damaging when compared to the 20 all at once. It's been almost a year and my elbows still haven't fully recovered from that experiment. The muscles were so worn out that the bones themselves were doing the work, and that's just stupid and self damaging. By forcing yourself, you are essentially ""cheating"" and turning off your safety mechanisms.  The proof of my point is the fact that your Seal guy broke many bones in his foot and had kidney issues. Cause and effect.  Some things can impress me, like how Jack LaLanne could do 1000 push-ups in one go (but he was thoroughly used to exercising heavily and knew what he was doing, he worked up to that and knew enough to take breaks and not go to extremes - he did, after all, live to his late 90s with high quality of life)  But a guy who exercises and harms himself doesn't really impress me. There is a difference between impressive feats and fool-hardy feats.  However, since he is a type of soldier, he is expected (by his superiors) to go above and beyond for his country. In this case such extreme mental fortitude and lack of care for his own body is required. I don't think a video should be made out of it though, as the regular citizen should not be doing things like this. Better to start slow and SLOWLY increase the load until you can handle things like that without injury.",9년 전,0,

@LeatherCladVegan,"I do (something roughly like) this at the gym, and I go through very distinct phases. (I'm talking HIIT running here)... So, the first stage is pain and discomfort, then I hit the wall and push past it, then I go a bit numb and start to get runner's high. It feels great. Then usually, when my head is spinning, I'll move onto weights, and always do 'more than I can'. I get so high sometimes I start to hallucinate. It's at this point that I can literally do anything. I can run another 40 miles if you ask me too, because I'm so high, my mind is essentially completely detached. I'm not feeling any pain... or rather, some part of me is feeling pain, but it is as though 'I' am only experiencing that pain by proxy. As though the physical pain is being communicated to me via morse code, rather than me actually feeling it.   Of course some days I just can't even get past the first pain barrier, like if I'm depressed or just unmotivated. But it was really amazing to learn that there are whole other levels of consciousness beyond that first barrier, where a lot of 'newbies' think they've had enough and give up (and I was guilty of that too, a few years back). You aren't even close, and the best thing to do if you feel you've 'had enough' at 15 minutes or something, is to crank up the difficulty. Increase the speed, the incline, the resistance, whatever - you'll reach the wall faster, and the faster you get to the wall, the faster you get past it, and what lies beyond is amazing.",9년 전,0,

@evilcam,"As an analogy to self-motivation, I think this is a fine idea.  You can go a little farther or push a little harder, and frequently you will be better for it.  Though that is just a very human approximation.  We don't know how to actually quantify what you're capable of, or where along the line you are at any given time.  It's not like the SeALs do a bunch of experiments and calculations to find out exactly how to make a number line and assign people spots on that line based on their full limits.  It is not scientific, it is a ""Seat of your pants"", spur of the moment type of idiom.  Going truly all out to 100% of what you're capable of could only mean death in the end, as you were no longer capable of doing something because you literally can't do anything anymore.  How do we determine we are 40% into an end result which logically should be death?  We can't.  There is no method of determining that sort of thing.  No ""capability"" quanta which we could divide up, assign proportional values to and turn into a number line.    So the important thing to remember from this is that you are capable of going beyond what you think you can do.  When you hit the limit, which is purely biological data as interpreted by your brain, which has been programmed through evolution to analyze your bodily systems and send signals telling you to stop or else you risk injury, you can go past that.  the 40% thing is banal woo.  It means nothing, it is just an arbitrary marker that once you hit it, you are capable of continuing.  40% is just a nice sounding round number implying you are capable of much much more.  The important thing there is that 40% is not 100%, as your brain and body might be telling you.  However, going to 100% is obviously a terrible idea, which is why we have that mental limit to begin with.  We're not gonna mate and pass on our genes if we don't have a self-governor and run or whatever til we die to stop that from happening.  So, listen to your body.  When you feel that arbitrary 40% parameter, you know you can go on.  Just know the soft limit is there for a reason, and decide for yourself if it is worth risking injury to continue.",9년 전,0,

Nobody taught me this rule; it's just something I came up with based on my own experience.  Last year I worked up to a long of 15 miles.  Using my 75% rule some of my long runs fucking sucked, but I never hurt myself.  No over-use or impact injuries.  I chalk that up to strength training though, but the point remains, you can go further than your brain tells you.  Overcoming the barrier is empowering; each time you overcome it you push on to find it again, only to overcome it again.  This winter I'm focusing on strength training.

@whynottalklikeapirat,"The 40% rule is not the key to anything. It's just the knowledge that most people can do more. But they usually don't. The key is in adressing that in a multiple set of scenarios with different people, and not in some rich kid telling about how he did more push ups because a seal was in the room. Usually that is not the scenario.  Besides not going to a 100% is tied in with evolved adaptational responses. It very often makes sense to conserve energy to do the real job when needed. You'll notice most tribes don't do pushups. They work at survival using scarce resources and available energy wisely. It's not to say that the seal insights are not motivating and thought provoking - but on the other hand theirs is not an average, normal human existence and the task requirements are very different from the main stream. This assumption that all people have a massive physical will at their disposal at all times if they'd only focus is fallacious. So many other factors affect human performance, and what is an advantage in one context may very well be a strong disadvantage in another.

@Recceman901,"Not sure who the SEAL was, but you should familiarize yourself with David Goggins.  Like most SEALs he also has an impressive life story.   He is a black man that he jokes can swim.  I didn't know black people normally couldn't, but the way he says it is funny.  He had a rough upbringing,  His biological father hung around Rick James (the singer)....so you can probably guess at some of the stories.   Another great man is Chad Flemming, a Captain from the 75th Ranger Regt.  the 2nd amputee to return to combat.  He actually had more deployments as an amputee than he did as a ""normal"" man.  He is extremely hilarious and a great man. Honestly, pretty much all of our Tier 1 guys are impressive....but they aren't boyscotts.

@Theomite,"There's 2 small problems with this approach that i can think of:  1. This technique doesn't rule out hazardous denial. Sure, you can probably push yourself beyond the limits you think you have...but at what cost? You mentioned that he damaged his kidneys and bones during the marathon, but he did it. There's a point where accomplishment exceeds the logic/need to do so. If he's planning on defusing a bomb at the end of the marathon and his livelihood is expendable for the lives of others, it might make sense...but sitting in a dialysis machine is a high price to pay for a ribbon/medal.  2. A big reason we don't push ourselves to do more is that we depend on other people being on the same page and at the same pace to assist us. You can burn through your paperwork in an hour at work with this technique...but it won't mean it'll be done because you still need other people to pick it up at their end. Taking this approach as a general rule in life means you look like and are perceived as a maniac who is potentially unstable because you push so hard when you don't need to AND it doesn't get everybody up to your speed. It also doesn't affect the turning of wheels that happen outside your control; you still need to wait for those things to get done before you can continue.",9년 전,0,

I believe only one guy died, a couple sun strokes, many passed out from dehydration, (anything over about 120 degrees you can't drink enough water to stay hydrated).   Before being deployed to Grenada a group of us were told to empty our ruck sacks into our duffel bags and form a line. We went into an area with our empty rucks with all type of ammo stockpiled and told to take as much as we wanted. Normally, everyone is given a basic load to carry into combat, just enough to get you started. We figured they were probably testing this basic load somehow. Fortunately, I knew the less you carry the better off you are - some guys loaded up. Unfortunately, my duffel bag that had spare cloths and essentials never made the trip. Within a week and a half our uniforms were rotted and ripping to shreds. Guys were borrowing tee shirts and bandannas to use as loin clothes. They flew in replacement uniforms toward the end, around the morning before they flew the press in for photo ops, (god bless the press).  Because of this the military made sweeping changes to the uniforms that is still in effect today.  Personally, one of my essentials that didn't make the trip was my ear plugs. I'm now have a 20% service connected disability. I know what my limit is, but don't really need to know and wish I didn't.  I look at people that push themselves to the limit for fun about the same as someone that uses razor blades to self mutilate.",9년 전,0,

When he met the SEAL he was obviously looking to IMPROVE his training to get to the level that he saw the SEAL display during the race.

Having trained to military standards for years, I can tell you that pushing pasts your limits will make you a stronger person, both mentally and physically.

That is at the brink of what the body can take, and that is very injuries and other very nasty stuff starts happening, so unless people are in real danger, like in a war or something, you should really never be above 60% in my opinion.

If this is beyond your mental effort barrier, please don't stress yourself, i'll reiterate it here:   The 40% rule is not meant to be used in all situations. It's meant to be applied when failure is not an option.   Of course it's not in physiology books, it's not a natural law it's a motivational saying promoting the idea that you are mentally tougher than you think.   I don't get why people are so damn resistent to this sentiment, it's like people don't ever want to push their boundaries. Everybody just wants to play in their safe, comfortable little sandbox and live blissfully apathetic of the fact that they never have and never will achieve anything significant because they aren't capable of pushing their limits. And hey, that's perfectly fine, different strokes for different folks, but it seriously irks me when these very same people try to hold others back from progressing! Pushing boundaries is not equivalent to running until your kidney is damaged, as for some reason you seem so fixated on. Pushing boundaries is a healthy thing that promotes progress and good health in moderation.",9년 전,2,

@OreoVII,"+Eric Miesbauer Your opinion makes a lot of sense in theory, but in practice it's not at all the case, ever. When my team hasn't gotten any turrets down, and the enemy is at our inhibitors just raping us over and over because the enemy doesn't want to end the game yet and my team is too stupid to understand the situation - it's a fuckin waste of time. I get what you are saying and I genuinely agree with it, but so many people don't know how to think critically about the severe disadvantage we are in when constantly clicking no to surrender even 45 minutes in.   If the enemy has twice as many everything as you do, then you really should surrender. Twice as many kills, twice as many dragons, twice as many barons, twice as many turrets, everyone on your team is negative kdr, everyone on the enemy team is positive kdr - there's really not a big chance you will come back from this and it really isn't a hard concept to grasp. A sports team, or any team for anything ever, barely EVER comes back and wins while being outscored 2+ to 1. Yet so many players have this retarded childlike impression of how they think heroes act, and just want to keep playing despite how awful the round is and vote no and win the vote because apparently 2 votes for no are more important than 3 votes for yes, so they get to keep wasting my fucking time.  I'm 28 and in the military. I have shit to do. I have responsibilities. I don't have a lot of time, and this game was clearly not made with people who actually have careers in mind.   If losing a game didn't result in such low IP gain, it wouldn't be so frustrating, but you spend nearly an hour just to lose and get next to nothing for it. There is really no benefit in losing, unlike many games where you still get a nice xp total depending on how you played individually. In LoL, it doesn't matter if you had a kdr  higher than the whole enemy team combined, if your team lost - you get nothing. That's what so frustrating about LoL, and I think that's what hooks people to it. The thrill of actually winning and getting something is like a gamblers rush, ya know?   /rant.",9년 전,0,

When I'm in running condition I have similar things happen.  I can hear and feel my heartbeat when I'm relaxing.  I'm no elite level runner, I assure you.  My long runs last year worked up to about 2.5 hours.  After the first 10 minutes or so my heart rate will work up to 140-180 depending on the intensity of the run.  As long as there are no irregularities, and you are not overreaching on your training, there is nothing dangerous about this as long as you are taking care of your body between training sessions.  I understand how that may not make sense to someone who doesn't train.",9년 전,0,

@Y0uKnoWh0,"+BunnaySango it's a balancing act. Initially we're so far into a comfort oriented life that following something like this can help push us up to our natural limits. But conversely we need to be wise enough to know when it's actually not worth it to push. It takes will power in both directions. Notice when the guy this video is about finished the initial race he had broken several bones in his foot and gotten kidney damage. Is that anyone's goal when it comes to running? Those things have lasting affects on people. Broken bones don't always heal properly, I have several I can personally attest to. Kidney damage can be lasting and can cause you to improperly filter your blood in the future and can lead to issues with urinary infections, vomiting, nausea and other life-long problems. I myself ruined several tendons in my foot doing the exact same shit. I couldn't walk for 4 months because I thought I was being a pussy when my brain was telling me to stop running. It was right. This motto is for getting you out of a comfort zone. But when your comfort zone switches to a place of discomfort a motto like this isn't always so helpful. Rehabbing my foot was horrible, and I can't really run more than 5 miles in one sitting now because the tendons are still weak, but I'm thankful for that 5 miles, things could be a lot worse. Doc says that maybe in a year they might be strong enough for me to finish a marathon but I'm not going to rush it. Physical fitness isn't always about crushing all of your goals. It's about patience as well, and sometimes we need to have patience and realize that simply improving upon yesterday's results is sometimes enough, even if we still haven't reached our goals. We all have long lives ahead of us barring freak incidents, we should train like we're going to be alive for a long time.

@gtamodman122,"Kavryel is making good points. All joking aside, this video is less ""important"" than one would actually think. Sure, there is the generic ""push yourself harder"" message, but it's not to be taken literally on all cases, especially in the field of exercise. Every trainer out there pushes the trainee to the levels that have been deemed as safe by the medical and the sports community. A newbie will be pushed just enough to start getting used to it, a mid-level athlete will be trained harder, and a professional will probably be pushing his limits every day. Trying to get a newbie to do what a pro-level athlete would do (=what guys who enter/graduate BUD/S are) is simply absurd, and unhealthy. SEALs aren't kickass monsters made of steel when they come out of their mothers. They spend their whole life being highly athletic and developing that mentality, taking it is slow. By the time they're in training, they have bodies and endurance many times better than that of the average man of their age. This is what allows them to push as hard as they do. But even they aren't invincible. I'm not sure how true this story is, but plenty other people from the SOF community can confirm that a lot of times, when you retire from a unit like this, your body is in a BAD state, because all the abuse it's taken over the years.SEALs don't push themselves like that simply through their minds-not that this doesn't play a big role as well. But fitness is the true key. In fact, I read about this guy a few months ago who was an olympic medalist in swimming and entered BUD/S. Gratuated top of his class or something.

We naturally put limits on ourselves mentally that aren't necessary. If you are not used to breaking through that first layer of ""I want to quit now"" you will never get better.

@goodndead8064,"I have read before (sorry I don't remember where so take this with a grain of salt) that the human body can heal from injuries while our muscular system is at full function. Animals experience nasty tears and muscle injuries in nature every day like us and there have been many documented cases of animals that had their legs ran over by car, fell a large distance and injured multiple muscle groups etc. and healed completely while continuously limping around every day all day. They don't sit down and use ice and wait around. Our bodies can heal from injuries much faster when we constantly supply the area with fresh blood. So injuries aren't as crippling as we make them to be.  There are of course compound fractures and other injuries that might spell doom for normal rehab but I am just referring to muscle, ligament, and tendon injuries. Remember I am not preaching this as a 100% truth or anything. I just remembered it after reading this thread and thought someone might know more about it or even debunk it.",9년 전,0,
@Kavriel,"Brittin Frielink Good on you for not preaching the ""TRUTH"". I kinda seem like i do that when i talk but don't worry i consider the possibility that i'm wrong whenever i say anything. I follow a vet channel named VetRanch, this channel takes medical care of injured, sick and contaminated animals.  Recovery and musle tear, fracture and open wounds is the norm. so i've seen a bit of that. So while it is true by my understanding that blood flow and inflammation is the first step of recovery, followed by duplication of the cells and reconstruction, the body is a mechanical construction; Each thing more or less has its place, and if it's displaced or diformed, trouble arise. Animals will heal from terrible wounds, but they become weaker, their bones not connecting, their legs, limping.  For proper reconstruction and healing, surgery is often necessary after important trauma. For small inflammations, superfical cuts, and the like, no need to baby yourself too much, desinfect the area, but don't take anti-inflammatory, they prevent the body's natural healing process. As an example of fracute and healing, i've broken my left pinky. Yeah i know poor me, however because i didn't know better, i wanted to continue lifting weights. After not enough time had passed.  Because of this my finger healed twisted somewhat and the joint isn't as smooth as it should be.  So what's the take away from that ? To grow strong you have to break and tear the muscle fibers, creating inflammation somewhat which triggers the improvement and thickening of the muscle cells. However ligament and tendon injuries (not inflammation mind you) are only fixed by surgery. Even tendonites, which is tendon inflammation can be extremely painful and debilitating.

@goodndead8064,"Bas Haren Not sure where I mentioned genetics but alright. I agree with you in my heart though because I seriously injured both of my shoulders as a kid doing hand stand pushups with bad form. I couldn't raise my arms over my head without gritting my teeth and my brain told me to stop moving. So as a dumb kid I did just that and just sat around until I was stiff as a board. Doctors I went to see three months later after no sign of hope were all treating me like a cripple and said that my body had healed badly and I was probably going to need surgery. I waited around and stopped exercising entirely for years until I met up with the ""best back doctor"" in Oregon. He even said that I am hopeless without surgery. What a waste of $400. I said fuck that and met up with personal trainers and martial artists in my area and they said I am going to be just fine. In fact, they were so unmoved by my story that I knew I was not very educated about how the body works.They took me in and showed me that my mind was weak at that time and that I had given up. Initially when I started my rehabilitation the pain was excruciating and I couldn't sleep but each day I realized that if it weren't for these guys pushing me harder I would still be whining on the couch. Years have passed and I am training harder now than I have ever trained before. I train smart and have never had any problems since. I think a huge part (not all) of my past problem and many others still today, stems from training with bad form, training like a weekend warrior,  and shying away from the thought of another injury.  The story about my uncle is just his personal story. He kept reinjuring himself and was forced to quit. That is his own fault for not pushing himself as I have.",9년 전,0,

Secondly : You actually think people should ""push past their limit"" for weight loss ? It's the most conterproductive thing you can do.

I mean they should work their fucking ass off if they want to have their goal body or lose 100lbs.

@chitaranjandev5306,There are  several things you can try Work out why you are shy - the first step to solving a problem is to understand why it is there. Be comfortable with yourself - this makes it less difficult when you are with other people. Challenge youself - you will gain confidence by taking action - especially by doing things which push your boundaries. (I read these and more ideas on Sartar Shy Method site ),8년 전,0,

@ronjohnson4566,"i have a brother who has spent his life as a athlete... including years of marathon, ultra marathon and biking.... plus many more... when we talk he talks about his guitar and running... he's lost on most all other subjects...i have another friend who has run a marathon in all 50 states and many other countries... his conversation is the next run. I've met a few seals and i must say they were fine specimens, but i never really heard any conversation that was stimulating... that being said.. i have had a wonderful interesting life, at least i think so, and as you can see, i can rant about most anything.... I would hope everyone finds many interests in their life. I would hope for them that they can see the relationships and beauty of all that they have looked into. It would be sad to hear that a marathoner or such wouldn't know the story behind why it's called a marathon. I met a well paid and well traveled executive who learned foreign languages thru  Rossetti Stone. It's a CD based or was, a way of learn foreign languages... he didn't know what the original Rossetti Stone was... he had no clue where the name came from.... there is a richness, a quality, a beauty in deeper understanding of your everyday life, that goes beyond (at least I think) pushing a rock up a hill. ",9년 전,3,

Neither of which are good enough reasons to risk your health.
