Bizarrely, Joan Rivers outed both Obama & ""Big Mike"" only weeks before she died mysteriously during a routine operation.  There's also a viral clip of Michelle dancing on the Ellen DeGeneres Show where you can plainly see Michelle's ""willy"" shaking around under her loose fitting slacks ( it's HUGE).

Wishing the Brazilians and the Argentinians success in Qatar 2022 World 🌎 Cup 🍵🍶  And i am wishing Messi and then Neymar resounding victories and perfect recovering from downturns.            The David. O. story of being really responsible for the activities leading to the drowning of his kid.                              By Samuel Osahon Aisien Patrick    Firstly it is well known to all, that according to the events unfolding in the public Media, "" Mr David O."", played a huge role in the events that in one way or the other, resulted to the drowning of his male Son.  Because, as far as it is the life of an infant that was at stake, at any given time, to me, no father or mother should by any means and imagination or by any Law and jurisdiction,, do whatever they deem fit, to their offspring..  Next,  i don't know whether any of you saw the video, where David o  was throwing the kid into the big swimming pool like a commodity. As a result of this, my thinking,  is that It is because the law don't work properly here, that is why people can act without care regarding the training of vulnerable little babies.   I remember being in that type of situation, when my mom took me once,  to little swimming inside deep waters. After which, a fellow kid also took me one time.   Everyone i believe, knows there is Spirit in swimming  training to swim in deep waters, and not just jacket technology that you only bought with the  too much Money of yours. Although my Mama introduced me, on one occasion to little swimming and its spirit, yet she and my Papa, made sure that i always feared to go into the deep waters.   And I was always told by her, that i was going to die inside water, but there is no evidence that show OBO training his kindred..    As a result of the amount of fear that my mother established in me, i still fear unnecessary risky and dangerous activities..  Subsequently, David o that I watched, in my view, was just callous in every imagination of it.  Next in my perspective, i don't know whether you people saw the video, in which Mr David O was seen throwing his child into the deep, with complete confidence and some kind of negligence in his display. At first, the video revealed, the kid seeming like he was scared.  Subsequently, it was like the papa, made him to believe, he was going to always get on perfectly in deep waters, with complete safeness.   And i also believe in him enshrining into the tiny boy,, the wrong notion of perfect safety with his money, and maybe an artificial technology, that the Man bought with this enormous wealth of his.   So, i am insinuating here the matter of fact that, responsible Parents,  is going to always create sense of fear of any danger, on their biological kids; in contrast to the rotten perspective, of super confidence and safeness..  Hence, giving that, some of us, who experienced similar devastating situations, had the benefits of being made to know or believe that, even the technology that we see work perfectly, will always fail us..  I am thus, of the opinion of the fact that Mr OBO David O., hold it as a moral duty to have inculcated that fear of dieing, which i feel is of great importance, into his little baby.   I am therefore, not in any way trying to suggest that the Law at any place in the World,  is supposed to hold david. o.., accountable or jail him for the death of his only non Yoruba, but igbo's baby Mama's son.   In contrary to that, what i am saying is that certainly in any sensible place, where the law is functioning, he, Mr David O, will get responsibleness, in terms of compensating for his dead son, financial wise and/or raising another Son's wise.   Hence, depending on whether it is possible or not,  i think may be other punishments can even be included, to deter lackadaisical approaches, as well as disrespect for the sanctity of the lives of real kids, when referring to the upbringing of little children.  What i have alluded to with this write up, is the story of David O being really responsible for the incident that resulted to the drowning of his innocent infant kid, that her Igbo wife, or baby mama delivered for him..",2년 전,0,

@samuelosahonaisienpatrick5040,"ARE THERE MORE THAN TWO  GENDERS IN HUMAN BEINGS?             by Samuel Osahon Aisien Patrick.   Although, there are only two genders, male and female, but, the fact is that we human beings have deviated from God's original perfect plan for us. This has resulted to abnormal birth and many other problems that act against people.  Firstly, Gender is the two different organs of reproduction in Sexual reproduction, which produces the two haploid cell gametes. These are the gametes which are released during sexual behaviours, from the different sexual organs, from two classes of individuals. They usually will combine, in fertilation to reproduce new individuals. Therefore, the reproductive organs which are male and female, indicate the categories people belong, that is male or female. More also, some characteristic features associated with the two classes of individuals,  that give the identity of being male or female, are what genders imply. In plant, you can also have neuter gender, which is not male or female, or has the characteristics of male and female identity.    So,  a gender is the obvious features that make any individual male or female, which indicate the particular sex organ of reproduction any individual has.  I will elaborate vividly the reasons why it seem there are more than two genders of human beings, in contrast to the obvious reality of there being only two genders - male and female.  In my point of view, i believe that the genders of male and female have been made imperfect by the problems that currently confront Human Beings. The beginning of our imperfections, which appear to influence reality of human being's genders, being either male or female, started from the beginning of creation, when Adam and Eve, deviated from God's perfect plan.  To explain this topic further - the natural problems have brought about abnormalities in the human acts of reproducing. I believe that these are the reasons why we have issues in Human genders, reproductive health, processes, and sexual relationship's.  For example there are the transgender males and females:: which from my research form the Transgender Communities.. These individuals are those whose gender identities can be different from the sex they were assigned at birth.   There are thus, many different ways by which transgender people define themselves. For instance, transgender women, although they were identified to be a male at birth, grow breast, which are often underdeveloped. They can have feminine fat redistribution, and their muscle mass can become greatly reduced. In addition, all the hairs in their faces and bodies may disappear, or become little. Their skin may become sleak, silky and easy. Their testicles also will start to decrease, and may be detached.  The members of these transgender communities are males and females. But the difference is that the transgender female for example, was recognized to be male sex during the time of delivery. But over time, they are found to have the gender identity of a female.   Next the transgender male, who originally was recognized to be female sex at birth, develop subsequently the identity of being a male. Some others  cannot identify with one gender completely.  They may have one of them, both of them, or intersex. Like  aruvani and jogappa, in the India hijra community who gave themselves the name ""kinnar"", they are neuter gender. In Pakistan, these category of transgender individuals are known as khawaja sira - which mean transgender in their language.   If we cannot say with certainty, whether these transgender individuals are male or female, when they are identified as males or when they are females, then a third and fourth genders may be inferred.   I think these type of problematic developmens  constitute of part of the aspects of illnesses militating against the health of many people on earth, which have symptoms.  So the changes that are visible in children as signs of being transgender :-   like certain bathroom behavior, whereby a girl would insist on standing up to urinate. Having repulsive behaviours of unwillingness and detest towards the wearing of specific clothings associated with the sex of the child from birth.  And subsequent development of possible preference for clothes  - such as shirts, shoes, and underwear, that are supposed to be worn by the opposite sex.  And the children are said to develop cravings for  toys that solely belong to the opposite Sex gender.   It is not clear whether transgender is a third gender. Base on the fact that they cannot easily be classified as males, females or neuter, because their genders undergo changes.  Another instance,  which significantly make it seem there are more than two genders, are abnormalities leading to People in different places becoming homosexual males and females.  Some vulnerable children, who are not as fortunate as others could be victims of rapes, assault, torture and molestation as kids, or they are born into an homosexual families /  settings, and thus made to become homosexual males and females. These can also be promoted by war like situations, bad character developments, bad home trainings, sufferings and other negative conditions.  Hence, by the above statement, it is clear that, homosexuals and lesbians are the other current realities, that make it seem or naturally indicate that there are more than two genders.   This write up dealt with the facts of transgender and homesexual male or female, resulting from the imperfections of the human race. So that it has generated confusion about whether there are only two or more than two human beings genders..  My thoughts are that negative practices, which ar not part of what we are  supposed to do naturally.Since they are not part of how God originally created human beings to become, are ungodly and not right at all. Consequentially,  they practical way of life of some people which  does not conform with basic norms,  therefore should be wiped out of among all persons. But, as a matter of fact, these problems was from the beginning of creation, when Adam and Eve where disobedient and deviated from God's perfect original plan.   It is imperative, that  civilized, normal and rational people like us human beings, should consider and accept all the problems of the people on Earth.. So that we will device the best possible way to solving them.   Since justice is seemingly the best way possible, whether social justice, international justice or upholding freedom and equal human rights for everyone on planet earth. We must uphold equally the rights of the most vulnerable person's in the world, including children, women, descriminated races, Transgenders and homosexuals as well.   Therefore the acceptance of these groups, who obviously are not Right in their ways, because their practices are wrong and awful, should be only to develop better world, where there will be equal rights, freedom, health and justice for all.",3년 전,0,

She might not be a man but in about 4 different videos she had something dangling around where a mans parts are. So u can call it a big clit or a toy or what ever you want women don’t have dangling parts like that. So. And the fact it’s hands are made like men’s hands and her shoulders are like men’s shoulders don’t mean anything either does it. But just bc Obama is president it means he has a wife don’t it. Not that they are for gays and he lies on everything else. That stuff don’t matter,4년 전,0,

And they were both highly educated, intelligent individuals, well spoken and well connected with the American community and the international community who showed respect for everyone. Leadership showing good examples of marriage, children and family is significant to the entire nation. The Obamas did their best to display themselves as ordinary people, who keep a good relationship and do their best to raise their kids the right - and not have rumors about extra marital affairs or sex scandals. They did not portray a dysfunctional family like Trump did, with his history of 3 wives, children and the rumors of the porn star scandal, a terrible marriage with Melania, and a bad relationship with his younger son, Barron. At least the Obamas should be honored for leading good lives and keeping a stable marriage and good relationships with their children. Well done to Barack and Michelle!!

@PornIsHate,"“We should also recall the political substance beyond the pleasant image”...:  Lets Not Mythologize or Whitewash Obama https://www.truthdig.com/articles/lets-not-whitewash-or-mythologize-obama/  “It’s well-documented that Obama loaded his team of economic advisers with Wall Streeters. So it’s no accident that Wall Street was bailed out rather than underwater homeowners during the biggest foreclosure wave in US history. The inside story of Obama’s semi-regular capitulation to economic elites is told in Ron Suskind’s book “Confidence Men: Wall Street, Washington, and the Education of a President.” Largely with GOP support—and over the objections of most Democrats in Congress—Obama kept pushing the corporate-friendly Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal until his last months in office.  Obama appointed Monsanto executives and allies to key food and agriculture jobs. While he acknowledged the science of climate change and talked of the need for action, Obama’s tenure coincided with a boom in U.S. oil production and lethal infrastructure, and his administration fervently promoted fracking worldwide.  His health care reform, which originated with the conservative Heritage Foundation, expanded health coverage largely by enriching private insurance firms and Big Pharma, whose lobbyists were allowed to obstruct cost controls. Obamacare did expand Medicaid and increase coverage in poor and rural communities and to young people, but it still left millions uninsured. ... Yes, Obama faced intense Republican obstruction in Congress. But it wasn’t Mitch McConnell who stacked the Obama administration with corporatist appointees and policies.  In pure math, Obama’s tenure was a boon to the GOP—Democrats lost their big majorities in the U.S. House and Senate and nearly 1,000 state legislative seats, while the 50 governorships shifted from a sizable Democratic margin to strong Republican majority.  My point is simple: It’s not good enough to “restore” Obama-ism. Look at the recent pattern of presidential history: When corporate-beholden Democrats win the White House and implement cautious, status-quo policies while inequality worsens, two things happen: 1) Right-wing Republicans quickly take back Congress, and 2) An Yes, Obama faced intense Republican obstruction in Congress.

There is more than 1way to steal votes! When you control media you WIN! So when a remark is made w/vengance/hate &/comes from a fig we respect like or admire we believe it! No accuracy ck or verification if her comment no MATTER how naive was not done & went out to MORE admired people in talk shows who repeated with such a vengance that I will NEVER look at them again w/envy or admire w naiveness when “Michelle Obama’ made an inaccurate ccomment it spread like a cancer on thus earth = effected vote is an understaement! I have not seen this kind of behavior since JFK & we all know what Ameriicans did to him! We ‘the people’ were taken out for trying to correct a wrong w/truth while she was allowed to this day Nov 16 2020 to have a misleading comment stream everywhere! Is corruption in the highest!

@mazinargga7160,"(To Western Society) … I sent the attached file: ( The earth belongs to Allah ) This Is The Link :  ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OELmaJqTOuq4it-dmakqhsgzcT9qqIgR/view?usp=sharing ) to many idolatry temples in the world via the regular mail and online , and I will keep sending it and urging the real believers in Allah to send it until Allah concludes a predetermined matter, but before you read it I would like to talk to you… the politicians ( policymakers ) in Western society and in the same time to all people in Western society through this message , My words with you will be a four questions I will ask you and I will answer them on your behalf.  My first question is: Are you against violence and hatred speech and the factors and motives that incite violence and hatred?? Your answer is: of course we are!... absolutely yes!!  My second question is: Are you a supporters and encouragers of so-called personal freedoms, freedom of demonstrations, and freedom of expression of opinions, freedom of religions, equality between men and women and same sex marriage?? Your answer is: of course we are!... absolutely yes!!  My third question is: Is the death penalty abolished from your judicial systems because you consider it as a savage barbaric act and not suited to the contemporary man?? Your answer is: of course it is!... absolutely yes!! My fourth and final question is: What do you do to the murderers? Where do you place them?? Do you put them in a resorts you call it jails!! in order to eat the best food and to exercise sports and to practice fitness on the latest sports equipments, and to watch TV and to use the Internet and to read books, magazines and newspapers in their clean place which equipped with a central heating and cooling all the times, and always you provide them a health care at all levels, And from time to time you supply them a new outerwear and underwear and pyjamas and perfumes and new shoes, and you protect them around the clock ,and no anybody has the right to touch them badly at all or to threaten them or to abuse them physically or verbally ,and nobody has the right even to annoying them or to disturb them at any time ,and on top of all of that they are not demanded to pay a cent for the costs of that wonderful life, but in fact the families of their victims are demanded to pay the costs for all of that from their own looted money which you call it TAX?? Your answer is: of course we do!... absolutely yes!!   Well.... according to your answers, it is very clear and it is very obvious that Without a feeling, and without noticing, and unintentionally you are the ones who definitely creating the environment for the existence of violence, hatred and crimes, and you are the ones who inciting and encouraging all of that to be existed continuously and to be spread and to be exacerbated.  Now listen carefully what I am going to say ….. Allah is the Lord of the worlds, and he is the Creator of the worlds, and all the human beings are one of His creations, Allah has graciously revealed His mercy to mankind , His mercy is the Religion of Islam ... and the Quran is the Words of Allah which are addressed to all human beings, Quran is a sacred and a Holy words, It is the Constitution from the Creator to the people , The whole Quran is a completed and integrated unit...it is cannot be followed and obeyed some of Quran verses and ignore the rest , in order to please people and to satisfy them!. The non serious striving by a visible ways to implement all God's constitution in the whole earth means a disbelief in God and a hypocrisy in its clearest form ... and it means the recognition and the acceptance of the existence of crimes in all forms in everywhere...and that will be the reason for the destruction of all human societies in all their differences. The serious striving by a visible ways to implement all God's constitution in the whole earth means a real protection and a real preservation to all people in everywhere.  Do you find up to this point that these words inciting violence, hatred and terrorism!?... Or you think the denying of God's existence and to his constitution and to eradicate Islam religion would be the best option and the superior choice ?!.. In order to embrace your laws and to please you and to satisfy you and to avoid your anger and to be that a clear obedience to your laws which inciting the ignorance, crimes and corruption in the whole earth.. Which been created by God.. And which only God own it !!  Blessed be Allah who says : (( Is it the laws of the time of ignorance that they desire? Who is better than Allah in judgment for people who are certain?)) , Allah is the Lord of the worlds and He is the Dominator to his creatures He said : (( Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the unbelievers )) , and He said : (( Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the evildoers )) , and He said: ((Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the sinners)). God does not call for violence and hatred, in fact he encourages and motivates and forces people to live in the earth as He wills...Not to live every person as he likes and wishes ,  Allah is the only Creator...he is our Creator.  No one can understand the God's Justice and His divine logic except those who have the ability to understand and to think and to conceive through the pure logic.  God has wrathed and cursed and prepared a terrible punishment to anyone who believes in some of His words and deliberately ignores the rest of them, He said : (( Do you believe in part of the Book and defy another part? So what is the requital of those of you who do that except disgrace in the life of this world? And on the Day of Resurrection, they shall be consigned to the severest punishment. And Allah is not oblivious of what you do))……………………….   Mazen Alargha",5년 전,0,

Do I need to go on? I won't go into the pardoning criminals part because I haven't heard enough about it, but to elaborate on the women's rights. Trump is taking away women's right to choose whether they can get an abortion. Taking away freedom of choice is taking away the unalienable right, given to all American citizens upon birth, of liberty. Abortion is something that's entirely case-by-case, so taking away the choice only increases the amount of unsafe abortions, which endangers the mother and maybe even kill her, and if you're pro life that's very contradicting seeing as you care about an unborn, maybe even dangerously sick fetus that might be diagnosed with a disease leading them to inevitable death more than the mother that could die from the unsafe abortions. You seem to care more about unborn lives than the breathing lives because supporting AND defending Trump means you're willing to support and are supporting a racist, sexist, pathologically lying predator who is the most selfish president, in my opinion, to ever be in office.",4년 전,1,

@davidmorrison2069,"I know exactly what you mean.  They sold out our country. I mean just look at what happened to our economy from Jan 2009 thru Jan 2017 while Obama was our President.  Back in Jan 2009 we were experiencing the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. And many people thought in fact that we were headed for another Great Depression which we not only avoided but instead our economic recovery from 2009 thru 2016 was truly remarkable. Given the fact that our economy lost (3,569,000) jobs in 2008 another (5,070,000) jobs were lost in 2009 for a grand total of (8,639,000) jobs lost in just 24 months which is unprecedented post WW II .....and since then our economy has greatly improved.....better than any other western type capitalistic country in the world.  In Jan 2009 when Obama was sworn into office the unemployment rate was 7.8% and in 2009 thru 2011 we had 30 straight months of unemployment at 9.0% or higher....as of Jan 2017, Obama’s last month in office the unemployment rate was at 4.8%.  From Feb 2009 thru Jan 2017 11,501,000 new jobs have been created.  Feb 2009 thru Dec 2009......(4,275,000) jobs lost 2010.....................................1,061,000 new jobs created 2011.....................................2,091,000 new jobs created 2012.....................................2,142,000 new jobs created 2013.....................................2,302,000 new jobs created 2014.....................................2,998,000 new jobs created 2015.....................................2,713,000 new jobs created 2016.....................................2,242,000 new jobs created Jan 2017.................................227,000 new jobs created  The DOW closed at 19,732 as of Jan 19, 2017.....up 148% since Jan 2009 when Obama was sworn in and it is up 198% since Mar 2009 when it bottomed out at 6,627.  The only time in recent history when the stock market performed better is when Clinton was president and the DOW went up 227% from 1993 – 2000…..it is even better than when Reagan was president and the DOW went up 135% from 1981 - 1988.  1/20/2009 thru Dec 2009…..31.2% Jan 2010 thru Dec 2010…..11.0% Jan 2011 thru Dec 2011…..5.5% Jan 2012 thru Dec 2012…..7.3% Jan 2013 thru Dec 2013…..26.5% Jan 2014 thru Dec 2014…..7.5% Jan 2015 thru Dec 2015…..(2.0%) Jan 2016 thru Dec 2016.....13.4%",5년 전,1,

@justperfect8272,"PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST ENDED THE OBAMA'S VACATION SCAM! Ex-President Obama was going to stick us for $2.1 billion or so. Before Obama left office, he arranged with the State Department for a series of ""official visits"" to foreign countries spanning the next 20 years. Using funds from the Office of Presidential Visits and Vacations, Obama was planning to use what would have been $2.1 billion in free vacations for him and up to 24 members of his family plus staff and even a dog sitter until the year 2036. He would have, that is, until President Trump put a stop to it. Trump, who is always looking for ways to save money, was presented with a ledger that contained all of the Obama's travel plans and expenses. The ledger was found by one of the workers President Trump hired from outside the typical White House staff. President Trump immediately canceled the plans and recalled all Secret Service agents scheduled to protect the Obamas anywhere outside of the United States. The Obama's are also facing another new challenge at the hands of President Trump. They're going to have to repay the government $214 million for all of those vacations that weren't official state business",5년 전,0,

If America loses to trump there will be no more high, there will only be depravity, violence, corruption and immorality. The stakes are too high, we must fight on every level.

I still think is just Bill Clinton's sister lmao.  It's impressive that for various, NUMEROUS years the 1st lady just.. Didn't exist as a household name. Nobody paid any mind to her and often the 1st lady did nothing but wave with her kids.  It's nice to see that during Obama's run his wife tried to do things for women, men and children. For all of America rather than just sit back for 8 years, smile and wave with her children.  Now we have Trump... And while I don't really give a toss cause Trump is what we needed as a wake up to the whole world.. It's like.. Yikes. His wife doesn't smile, doesn't look happy, never sounds happy and just overall has a miserable, depressing aura around her.  Hopefully the next President will do a fantastic job and have their 1st lady or gentleman be a bit more happy looking like we have with Michelle.  And hopefully the next president, whoever she or he will be.. Will actually rebuild and fix what has been done to the US and how strained it has gotten.

Yes though every president does have to play a little bit of the game with powerful enemies like Russia and China, we can't bully either of them or go to war, but they can't do it to us really either. As far as the economy goes we had 8 years of consistent growth under Obama, trump actually skyrocketed the deficit and debt in three years putting us into a recession before the pandemic caused near total collapse.

You've latched onto an idea that is insane in its very essence because most people don't beleive it, because who would? Obama represented democrats and liberals, of his wife was trans believe me that wouldnt have hurt him. It doesn't make sense it its set up, let alone hold up to scrutiny, and it has FUCKING NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING IMPORTANT ANYWAY. Like I dont care that trump has paid off hookers for silence, I care that he consistently refuses to attempt to unify the nation. He lets his own personal feelings and ego issues get in the way of him being a leader. I dislike Bush and Obama for doing their things I feel are wrong, but I never doubted they loved our country and wanted to help and make us all better. Clinton is a terrible person but best president of the last 40 years, no doubt at all, followed closely by reagan for his image building but clinton undoubtedly assured our power before 9/11 and we bankrupted ourselves. I dont even really blame Bush for that,  but he was the face so it is ehat it is.

@imaferretmaster," Brian Rod  oh the police? They're a tool for the rich yeah, not sure about specific banks but maybe. I mean i think we can both agree if the cops didn't have mandatory quotas to meet monthly then crime would probably decrease and so would instances of racial injustice. The cops have to constantly make arrests and write tickets, crime can't go down if the cops are required to report it to get their paycheck. Imagine if the cops could let a dipshit being a dipshit go rather than needing to arrest them because private prison owners need inmates to make money. The police should have guaranteed salaries unless they violate their position and lose their job, then maybe they can focus on protecting and swerving rather than arresting and fining.",5년 전,0,
@imaferretmaster," Brian Rod  like you know who takes a financial hit if we reform the police system? Governors, senators, private prison owners. Thats why we have the system we have, this system forces police officers to put themselves in danger to get a paycheck, rather than focusing on violent crime and choosing to put themselves in danger to protect the innocent, it hurts all of us.

If the information is completely covered up then how would these people know about it?",5년 전,1,
@imaferretmaster," Jack Hook  i can't prove you wrong because your claim isn't falsifiable. You're saying something happened, I cant find any information about it actually happening, just people saying that it did. It's really that simple, you have to prove what you claimed, i can't prove to you its untrue other than the lack of any evidence of the claim. Like I can say that George W Bush got kicked out of college for fucking a dog. I can't provide any evidence of that being true but I can certainly make the claim. The thing is you also can't prove it isn't true. Thats how these ridiculous conspiracies gain traction in the first place. Like Michelle Obama being a man, Alex Jones started that story, because he carefully analyzed pictures of her in dresses, thats his entire basis.

I mean, again I cant just assume something is true when there's zero evidence to support it.

@oneandonlyjark," @anthonyt3872  White privilege is being able to say things like that, compartmentalized and ""objective"", at one's leisure and at another's expense. At the end of the day a white person read this conversation and felt the need to either shrug their shoulders or get nitpicky and engage in what-about-isms; a black person read this and felt defeated, or felt the responsibility to say ""Um, actually"" and still get ridiculed/criticized in turn.  You'll see those comic book channels for example, that have hetero Caucasian male content creators, say they aren't living their lives discriminating against The Other, arguing their case reasonably (which usually devolves to ""denigrating"" the opposition POV), but don't spend one minute really listening to another person and being empathetic. They're applauded for their position and process.   White people are only now being asked to do what the rest of us do: make an effort to do a little more than just placate and accomodate someone different, without turning their nose up at the request (well, for the last 30+ years we've asked them but particular to my generation, it's only now as adults do we have skin in this game).  I don't know what that ""little more"" is, but for me it's someone in your position understanding that: (1) simply going along with the same old status quo is the principle underpinning of systemic prejudice; (2) trying to pinpoint examples of minority success and majority failure is ridiculous what-about-isms and other logical (and emotional) deflection.   At the end of the day, cultures from as far east as Japan to west as Hawaii, and as far north as Norway to as south as Australia or the tip of Chile, all dance to the tune of modern Western European/American civilization (itself highly predicated on Greek/Roman antiquity). Asian people celebrate the Gregorian New Year's, sing auld Lang syne and wear modern business attire (""modernity"" defined on Western terms too); Indian people adopt westernisation in their media and marketing and common languages; less affluent countries like my parents' adopt Western media and ignore developing their own markets; everybody's currency is measured in relation to the USD... Etc. Etc. And we all fear NATO military-industrial complexes.  Don't you wonder why Russians, Chinese and other big wig cultures (many of whom potentially dwarf the US alone by far in terms of population) resent us and pay us lip service? We may as well be their overlords demanding tribute.  Put the domestic and international contexts together and there's a class of North Americans -- on average more affluent than many others elsewhere in the world -- who get scoffed at behind their backs, by their own ultra-priveleged neighbours. That's white privilege.

It just so happens that the videos I've linked are more convenient than attempting to explain as a layman. Please take a look at the second link i posted. The lady being interviewed was a federal banker turned whistleblower and she presents all of the evidence proving what she is saying. If you're correct, why do you need to be so hostile and rude? Surely you can illustrate your point without being a meanie head.

Skip to 8:41 for his warning about the Military industrial complex, or give the whole thing a watch if you have time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyBNmecVtdU   Also, did you watch the second video I linked with the whistleblower? it's certainly much more concise and really provides all the evidence that this is not a conspiracy theory, as opposed to the first video. It seems you are only refuting the first video I linked which is understandable because the man was a layman as well, but all the damning evidence is in the second link.

Actual slavery is when human beings are forced via violent coercion into being material possessions themselves, to the financial benefit of others. Yes, everyone who works a job who is not the boss is benefiting the corporation for which they work, but to argue that white people who go home every night to their own home - and to families who are not being murdered or sold - are actually ENSLAVED?

@ilovejesuschrist7598," @imaferretmaster  thise aren't their kids and Obama is the antichrist my friend. We can debate wether Michelle is a man or women but idk truthfully. But like u said just because someone said some doesn't make it factual. Those aren't their kids I know that for a fact and Barack Obama doesn't have sex with women being the antichrist another thing I kno for a fact. Michelle being women or Michael the man I do not know for a fact but again I know for a fact those aren't their kids if so like u said prove it. Let me see 1 baby picture or even a picture of Michelle/Michael being pregnant. It's funny that u can find baby pictures of Michelle supposedly with her mom as I said idk if she is a man or not so I give her the benefit of the doubt, but u will never find a picture of Michelle hold8ng her own babies. Why u might ask? Because they aren't hers. Wake up and if u don't know anything about Jesus Christ or the Bible or aren't walking in the Spirit then u won't know these things. I was Spiritually shown this about Barack my friend and my common sense and spirit wouldn't allow me to be fooled by those being their kids. She may or may not be a women but Obama is gay and do not sleep with women. Now was he born in the US BUT in Kenya. May God Bless and show u the Truth. Also Obama not even being from the US came and legalized gay marriage which is blasphemy and considered a abomination according to scripture. If he wants to be or any1 else wants to be gay then fine but don't use the Holy Bible that is flat out against it to marry. If they don't agree with the bible being gay then they shouldn't use it to get married. It's disgusting and no different then murder. Goodbye and GodBless",3년 전,0,

@rileycoyote8275," @imaferretmaster  You've written 25+ messages defending Michelle Obama., and have attacked anyone who has a less than glowing comment about her. Unless you're being paid to defend her, her accomplishments have absolutely nothing to do with you. Yet, you're touting her, as if she and her achievements are somehow a reflection on you. Insulting a person's  intelligence and (wrongly) informing them that Michelle Obama is somehow better than them, says far more about you than it does the people you're insulting. Newsflash, she's not better than anyone, not even you. No human being is better than another. In your research, I'm sure that you've discovered the numerous lawsuits, (which they tried to bury), against both she and her ""husband"",  as well as all of the unlawful, egregious and immoral acts they've committed against the citizens of the United States. Such acts, are anything but admirable, unless, of course, a person had equally nefarious intentions about the American People. Therefore, in my objective opinion, she is not anyone to admire and is certainly not anyone to idolize. Frankly, I don't care how much she's achieved, I will never admire her or her husband. Human beings shouldn't be idolized, and I have never and will never idolized any human. I don't admire anyone who has hatred and disgust for the country they were (and still are) representing. Nothing that you claim, and nothing she has achieved or accomplished, will change my mind. If you choose to idolize her, be my guest, it's disturbing, to say the least, but if it gives your life purpose, then more power to you.",3년 전,0,

You choose to use emotions and moral high ground fallacies to solve a problem that so desperately requires logic.

And when I say progressive, I am referring to neo-liberal progressivism that is inherently rooted in marxist ideology.   I would argue it's not even progressive anymore, the factions of the political left and right have switched, the left wants to bring back race based discrimination and segregation, wants to bring society back to Weinmar Republic Germany, the political right wants to progress society to a level where people are judged based on their merit and character, not skin color, and wants to address the root problems plaguing POC, whereas the political left refuses to acknowledge the root causes and instead points to only the symptoms, and builds a strawman and blames the problem on historical events and ancestral figures not even alive anymore - and when you ask ""why"" and dive deep, that's when you begin discovering that the political left profits from the root cause and maintains political power by keeping the root cause alive.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

@juliapinzon9970," @wingsthings806  I can understand how you think the person loses credibility by misrepresenting what they actually mean. However, I still think you are being awfully pretentious by trying to make the person feel stupid for the mistake. If the person was simply informed, if you had said ""lol pure oxygen kills but I get your point"" they might respond by being like ""oh haha I totally didn't realize that"" and could laugh about it, but I disagree with the condescending way you informed them. You said that you were laughing at them and that they shouldn't be allowed to vote, which is a disproportionately harsh reaction to someone simply not knowing the properies of oxygen. What I'm saying is that, even if someone makes a mistake by being uninformed, especially something small like the properties of oxygen, it's not okay to be mean to someone like that. They're still a person. It seemed like a quick way to feel good about yourself by putting someone down, which is a pretty unlikable quality in a person.",5년 전,1,

Plus, he used his dad's position to get a special permit from the Mongolian government so he can add another dead animal to his collection. Just shows what kind of people they are. His dad becomes president and he took it as an opportunity to use it as clout to add rare animals to his collection. I'm not against hunting entirely, go get tags and hunt deer or other animals that are in abundance, and do the whole thing on your own dime. You want security with you, pay for it. Don't use taxpayer money for your personal hunting trip. How is that ethical? But I digress.   I miss the Obamas.",5년 전,0,

@ulthelth2899,"In Milwaukee, Michelle Obama said: For the first time in my adult life I am proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback. Obama’s remark was made before her husband had won the Democratic nomination and nine months before was elected president. What a negative person she is. Check out the University Chicago Hospital job for $326 K Michelle was given for favors from Barack and the Illinois States money.  Michelle Obama was an adult when we won the Cold War without firing a shot. She was an adult for the last 25 years of economic progress, social progress and more…. the American people on the whole agree that the last 25 years of American history has been good and is not a narrative of despair and nothing to be proud of. Obama’s remark was made before her husband had won the Democratic nomination and nine months before was elected president.  What a negative person she is. Check out the University Chicago Hospital job Michelle was given after   Michelle Obama's $300K ""Job"" at Hospital Eliminated (Obama earmark kickback)  After Barack Obama became an Illinois state legislator, his wife moved up as well, scoring a job as 'vice president of community relations' at the University Of Chicago Hospital for a very generous salary of $121,910. When Obama became a senator in 2005, her 'salary' leapfrogged to $$316,962 for the same job...and one of Senator Obama's first acts in office was to see to it that the hospital received over a million dollars of your tax dollars as an earmark.   Well, Michelle has moved on,and guess what...that vital job of hers, worth a salary of over $300 K has been quietly eliminated. It's the Chicago Way, cushy no-show jobs in exchange for political patronage...fist bump. Of course, she had to work twice as hard to get half as far. She said so, so it must be true.  But I wonder, is this so very different that what Rod Blagojevich was popped for? Except that Blagojevich got caught and embarrassed everybody?  The IL State hospital board...which had members appointed by Obama who also removed THREE people from the board who saw the corruption moved to stop the pay to play donation of giving the University of Chicago hospital a $1 million kickback to the UofChicago hospital. One hand washes the other. And now that her work is complete they eliminated that position. Michelle Obama gets hired from a $70,000 a year job right after that for $326,000 salary working in a position with no experience or schooling. Chicago Daily Observer 14 January 2009 65 Comments Michelle Obama hasn’t shown up for work very regularly over the last year, so when Michelle Obama’s over $300,000 job was cut at the University of Chicago Hospitals, it was hard to notice the difference.    Tony Rezko, Obama’s Daddy warbucks, went to jail for extorting consulting contracts out of a Chicago area hospital in exchange for favorable consideration by the IL State hospital board...which had members appointed by Obama. Rezko also indicted for bribery was involved making the deal for the house in Hyde Park Chicago area where OBAMA (which Obama could not afford) lives in and removing part of the property from the purchase and price.  That's called pay to play and favors buying Obama a house.  Michelle’s position was a half time, 20 hour a week job. And to think they were critical of Blagoyovich’s [sic] wife for taking $100,000 in fuzzy real estate commission. My thoughts: How did this bit of quid pro quo corruption escape the sharp reporters that dug through Sarah Palin’s garbage and kindergarten files? Unbelievable![  The Post revealed other ties between the hospital and the Obamas: Valerie Jarrett, the medical center’s chairwoman who travels with the candidate; hospital board member Kelly R. Welsh, a bank executive who gave the Obamas a $1.3 million home mortgage loan, and Eric Whitaker, the center’s executive vice president who now runs the Urban Health Initiative. What these ties will mean for a President Obama, the paper didn’t quite say.  ALSO the Chicago Tribune today weighs into the debate over programs linked to Michelle Obama that seek to steer least profitable patients with non-urgent illnesses out of the emergency room at the University of Chicago Medical Center, where Obama is a vice president, and into local clinics.The university medical center appears to be 'culling the least profitable patients from its emergency room.'

Females have had to go through insane amounts of sexism and having a competent female president would be a very big step in bettering our society and making everyone more open minded, and having our first female president also be someone of color will further bring social equality.

@TepiLizard," @ulthelth2899  The point isn't to elect someone because of their skin color OR their gender. But both women and PoC - black or otherwise - are going to have to battle against the entrenched mentality of the majority of the population feeling that an old white dude is the best option. What are our options now - Trump vs Biden. Biden's main contender was Sanders. All three are old white dudes. When Obama came into office, despite the racism that we're seeing so rampant today, it was a huge step! I was about 75% sure that he would have ended up assassinated by some small-minded dickwad who wanted to exercise his right to carry and make a statement. Then he got elected for a second term, and served it, and is still around. And the Obamas, both of them, still exhibit insane amounts of class, and they have the respect of tons of us out here, not just in the States but elsewhere around the world. No president is perfect, but Barack was about as good as you're likely to find in a politician, and Michelle was exactly what one would expect from the spouse of a president.  I'll go so far as to say that, while I agree with OP saying the first female president being Black being a huge step, I still think we're more likely to see a Black female president before we see a Brown president - male or female - especially if that person (Brown or otherwise) happens to be Muslim. I don't even think America could wrap its brain around having a Jewish president, let alone Muslim. Or perhaps a single president, or gay/bi president, or... well, I'm not holding my breath for a trans president anytime soon.  Point is, we need better representation by minorities in the White House. If we had that, then hopefully we'd've seen some change in society before things reached the critical mass they have today. And if you want a Bible quote to take to heart, here ya go: 1 John 3:18 - Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth. And while you're at it, take a look at the verse that comes right after the ""most popular verse in the Bible.""",5년 전,4,

Also since I'm not from the US I of course have a completely different perspective on things, but I just can't help but think that Trump somehow is less of a warmonger than what's usually expected of a US president and that that is connected to the incredible backlash he's getting all over the place (also in european msm).  In terms of how good of a job Obama did in representing America in the world I think it really depends on who you ask. Western eruopean allies? They seemed happy.. but generally speaking most of the people on this planet are against war so I'm having a hard time imagining that in the long run his presidency will be viewed in a good light by most people.

They both don't give a shit about the people. maybe wealthy people. The only color both these two care about is green. The problem is that candidates most of time are both terrible. Its the lesser of two evils approach. How are you going to expect evil person to do good things unless it benefits them? Both political parties are flawed. The politicians blindly follow another person of the same party because its ""buddy system.' Just like when they have the debates. These candidates talk shit about each other for months. Then one gets picked for the party. Now everybody supports this candidate after complaining for months that they were not good enough for the job. I don't think you have to keep going around and telling everyone how bad they are. however, don't start blindly supporting them because of your political system. I support Dave Chappelle's approach. He said he would give Trump a chance but he demanded that he gives the historical disenfranchised a chance also. When he felt like Trump didn't do his part, he more or less doesn't give him that chance anymore.

Now, stuff Obama did was he rescued the country from the Great Recession, cutting the unemployment rate from 10% to 4.7% over six years, Signed the Affordable Care Act which provided health insurance to over 20 million uninsured Americans, Ended the war in Iraq, Ordered for the capture and killing of Osama Bin Laden Passed the $787 billion America Recovery and Reinvestment Act to spur economic growth during the Great Recession, Supported the LGBT community's fight for marriage equality, Commuted the sentences of nearly 1200 drug offenders to reverse “unjust and outdated prison sentences"", Saved the U.S. auto industry, Helped put the U.S. ontrack for energy independence by 2020, Began the drawdown of troops in Afghanistan, and Signed the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals allowing as many as 5 million people living in the U.S. illegally to avoid deportation and receive work permits.

In 2016, thanks to 0bama you were looking at 20-25% of real unemployment in your country. As per figures released by by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/famee.pdf), 20 percent of American families do not have a single person that is working.  Meanwhile, the number of Americans getting money or benefits from the federal government each month exceeded the number of full-time workers in the private sector by more than 60 million.  Welfare handouts had reached at a record high! the percentage of working age Americans that actually have a job has been below 59 percent for more than four years in a row, which means that more than 41 percent of all working age Americans do not have a job.  Welfare spending and entitlement payments made up under 0bama up 69 percent of the entire federal budget. While Barack Obama was in the White House, the total number of Americans on food stamps went from 32 million to nearly 47 million. More women were on welfare than in the workforce under 0bama...",5년 전,0,
@carpelinguae9097," @alvenealston8825  Back in the 1970s, about one out of every 50 Americans was on food stamps.  In 2016, about one out of every 6.5 Americans was on food stamps.   It sounds crazy, but the number of Americans on food stamps under 0bama exceeded the entire population of the nation of Spain.   According to one calculation, the number of Americans on food stamps in 2016 was greater than the combined populations of “Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming.

He stifled businesses through hundreds of new regulations.  He ignored our armed forces.  He let ISIS, North Korean and Iran run wild.  This man almost turned the US into a welfare state.

Melania didn’t appear to even understand the substance of the question – until a translator repeated it in English. huh? Also, your girl previously claimed she’d graduated from The University of Slovenia with a degree in architecture and design.

I’m going to go out on a limb and guess even you have heard of those two schools. Anyway, back to Melania.

And with his secretary of state the war-like Hillary he failed in his promise to end the war in the middle east. Never even tried to. In short Obama was everything the corporate Democrats stand for but he hid it behind some real smooth talking. And remember Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton are also part of this camp.

On the OTHER hand, I would trade my complaints with my healthcare costs to live in a nation that isn't run by a dishonest narcissistic pedophile, that isn't xenophobic, doesn't build walls, and doesn't run concentration camps where children die of treatable diseases like the flu.

I don’t care if Obama wasn’t the Great at passing bills and whatever the hell else presidents do. But at least we could be proud of him and He did not hurt us as a nation. The harm that Trump has done in dividing this country and bringing bigotry and racism once again into our daily lives Will last for many years to come. To say nothing of how he has alienated us from our allies and made people around the world not trust us anymore. He has harmed our national security more than any other president in history by working with our enemies and turning our Allies against us so that no one has our back anymore. A country could decide to attack us now Because they know That nobody would want to help us. We went from Obama making us the proudest we’ve ever been of our country, to trump making us the most ashamed we have ever been of our country. I pray that God will help us through this difficult time. And that he will show the Republicans who stick up for Trump no matter what because they only care About getting elected again, the error of their ways. Maybe one day once again have a president and first lady that we can be proud of.",6년 전,0,

@brandyhuffman514,"God i miss the times when we had a president in the white house that was not only classy, intelligent, but also very likeable even when he met criticism everyday! Also it is amazing the things he was able to accomplish during his presidency with the Republicans going against absolutely everything he wanted to do for this country and the American people!  When Obama refused to give up, especially on items he was really passionate about, people blamed him for the outcome instead of blaming who is responsible. Instead of commending him and speaking up for him and his exhaustive efforts to pass something to help the American people, he was treated with the opposite from Republicans because all they care about is they didnt win the election so they want to try and shut down as much as they can from Obama. Therefore, some of the bills ge was finally able to pass because he refused to waver on, werent perfect and if people want to know who to blame then they need to blame Republicans! Mainly everything that was in the final version of the Obama Healthcare Bill he was finally able to get passed, after revising many times to make the Republicans somewhat happy, that the American people and Republicans say is horrible is exactly the changes the Republicans wanted and demanded to pass it! It still bugs me when i hear a Republican official say in an interview that Obama Care is horrible because they freaking got what they asked for! Instead of pouting and being chikdish about losing an election, how about you suck it up and actually work with the President and party to accomplish great things instead of trying to block everything a President of another party tries to accomplish for our country and the American people! Also to the Republican party, its not ok to find the most incompetent, ignorant, crooked, and narcissistic person that has the ability to do a great job of inciting  violence, ignorance, and false claims in front of a Republican based croud and help get him elected. Its not ok to help a person like this and be ok with babysitting him and having to try and run interference because of what he may say or do just to have your party in office! You should all be ashamed and all that continue to support him that hold office should be kicked out if office and never aloud to hold a Federal, State, nor County office again!!!",6년 전,0,

@jamesfiaco4922,"it is because of people like Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump that America has the highest violent crime rate and drug and alcohol dependency problem in the world. At the same time the lowest standards of quality pertaining to our air, water, foods, landscapes, working/ living environment every day home products.  Seriously why should Mitch McConnell care about anything pertaining to honestly, obeying, or properly enforcing the laws when his wife stole 75 million American tax dollars through shady deals that are definitely criminal.  Obviously people like Donald Trump don't care about women and children safety.  Because they are sexual criminals on top of being sexual failures, I mean all you have to do is Look in Donald Trump's ex- wife's   and current wife eyes and you will see the look of frustration and disappointment let down.  Keep in mind sexual crimes are classified as the weakest form of criminal conduct.   Locker room talk! Not according to criminal psychologist, brain specialist, and leading physicians.        What we all heard Donald Trump confess to on the access Hollywood bus interview was much more consistent with the jailhouse confession from one inmate to another or a prison reminiscence from one convict to another who are living out their sentencing in protective custody  case closed big boss Jamie has spoken. Mercy, forgiveness, and spiritual welfare are not changing those facts. Protecting, carrying, and compensating any souls or spirits that are connected to a life that freely does not do its best to improve upon and maintain the quality of it. Now I wish and pray for my soul and spirit to be held spiritually accountable to the statements I proclaim. I guarantee you never see hear another body, man in power, persons of legal religious, authority, and leaders!! Ever freely validate the statements they proclaim with that level of certainty. One reason could be they don't have the best interest of the majority of the population's needs at Heart another reason could be the cum from a breed of cowards or simply have a lifestyle that suggests, confirms, and validates them as being feebleminded and physically inadequate, submissive subservient it doesn't get any worse than that.              One is genetic hereditary the other is a generic learned behavior either way it is physically, mentally, and spiritually useless to freely live and die in such a low quality manner especially if that stupidity, weak, and desperation stems from being soft, lazy, out of shape, over fed, and undernourished neglecting your own physical freedom. Maybe being overworked and underpaid with dirty low-paying jobs,  that come from outdated power sources, inferior materials, poisonous, toxic substances, pesticides, and chemicals that never change their killing composition which means, simpleton whether it is a solid, liquid, or burnt off into our airways or atmosphere as a vapor is always going to be poisonous, debilitating, and deadly to the body at the same time polluting, corrupting, and devastating to mother Earth and all the various different forms of life that live within this world. There is no profit to be made and the demise of the planet.                   Which is a real possibility because we are facing environmental and financial global collapse with these dirty low-paying jobs. Mitch McConnell Grim Reaper.  Okay will then he should know that if life is not free then why the hell would death be any cheaper, It's not. And now I know who souls and spirits have paid out are picking up the tab on the end results of dirty low-paying jobs. have paid out are picking up the tab on a diminished quality of life.  Have been, or are being implemented with all of the disease, sickness, illness, injuries, pain, suffering, torment, abuse, neglect, and hunger.  That has been allowed to occur manifesting throughout the history of mankind into what it is today thanks to people like Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, Ted Cruz, Roy Moore Bill O'Reilly, Harvey Weinstein, and WikiLeaks.

@janishart5128,"​ @trentpatrick9326 ​:  Well, it could be that they have a ""pre-nup"" - but we have no proof of what their marriage agreement is.

I think she sees him for the inherently good person he is, and respects and loves him for that.  She doesn't have to wear her feelings 'on her sleeve', as it were.  Even years ago, when they were much younger, she never seemed to smile that much - maybe because she spent a lot of time as a model, smiling.

@johnryan8859," The Bushwacker  hey wacky i remember bubba turning the USA over to Wcha with a fantastic budget that georgieboy turned into a calamity by fighting 2 wars on a credit card & a giant budget deficit that had this country at the edge of the cliff & going over when President Barack Obama took over along with his team using some unconventional methods to bring our country back from the brink & ended 1war, the 1 we never should have been in cause it was W's personal war with Saddam to avenge him calling daddy Bush a coward for not having Gen Swartzkoff kill him when the General had him in his sights. President Obama brought jobs back to where there was a surplus with everyone had one that wanted one. Unemployment was at a low & the stock market had skyrocketed from disaster much like it is now thanks to covid. He turned it over to 45 who has improved it somewhat but gave minor taxcuts to the middle-class & great big cuts to himself, his rich buddies & corporations. He didn't do this with a surplus. He did it by running up the deficit, which means he basically did it by taking out a loan that future generations will have to pay back. Now I have a question for you. Why didn't trump run against Obama in 08 when things were so dire & or in 2012 when things were well on their way back? My answer to you is if you look at trump's handling $ that daddy trump left him, he would have put the country into bankruptcy like he does with any of his businesses when the going get tough. He doesn't pay people (contractors)who work for him. He basically bullied them with his staff attorney or fixer aka Michael Cohen. When people didn't get paid they had to sue him & when Cohen would counter-sue & these small companies didn't have the $ to outlast him. Using a staff attorney was much cheaper than calling a firm to bring a frivolous suite that a big firm probably wouldn't have wasted their time with.",5년 전,4,

@_Mr.D,"@Tom smith Tom, first I have to say that I appreciate that you actually have the courage to use your name, I assume .   Anyways Tom, I was not discussing anything to do with politics. I was talking about her as a first lady.   Were you alive when Princess Di got married? Like millions, I watched the wedding wondering what this woman would become. Soon it became apparent that she was independent, smart, caring towards others, a big advocate of helping those in need and using her position to bring to the fore the plights of such one's from around the world that others simply would have overlooked.   But mostly she was a loving mom that kept her kids grounded. It didn't matter who talked to her, it was not hard for that person to have respect and admiration for her.  In this way, in THIS WORLD she is just like that Princess, except Black. There is NO WAY that if ANY other first lady did the things that she does and was right there with the common folk intermingling and down to earth, that we would be having this conversation, not in the least bit.   I am just baffled that people could be that closed minded and ignorant so as to dismiss a person simply because they, have a different eye color, or because their hair color is different, or because one is taller or shorter OR because one simply has more melanin in their pigmentation. Could people truly be that stupid? Really???    It would be as ridiculous as saying ""My car is superior because it's......well, Black"". The outside has nill to do with that which truly makes up a person as would the outside color of a car make any measurable difference as to it's performance or quality.    Now, minus any of the typical nonsense  the people spew, were you to look at that which Princess Di did in addition to what Michelle Obama has behaved like, give me 5 examples where in which her behavior, her intelligence, her  raising of children, her interactions with the populace or any other aspect of her overall disposition that would make her sooooo much inferior as so many of you would imply?    There should be such a multiplicity of examples that you can easily rattle them off!",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@tati5843,"I miss Michelle and Barack so much that it makes me tear up whenever I watch any clip that one or both of them is in. It's so odd how much has changed since they were in the White House and how much more dark and depressing things seem right now, not only in Washington but just everywhere; within people. It was only about two years ago that the Obamas left the White House, but it feels like we are living in a completely different time. It makes me want to curl up in the fetal position, honestly.   Barack and Michelle were really good people. They were people I felt like I could have over to my house to have dinner, talk, dance, and watch a movie with or something. There was just such a warm energy around them, especially Michelle. And with Barack in charge, I felt safe. It makes me so pissed off to think about how terribly they were treated; the nasty things that people said about Michelle. I can't imagine what that must have been like for her, and sometimes when I watch videos of her from right before November 2016, I sense a sadness in her and it infuriates and saddens me. She was one of the warmest and most humble First Ladies this country has ever seen, and she didn't deserve to have people treating her the way that they did for 8 years. And it's a complete joke that right now, the same Republicans who did everything they could to make Barack's life Hell for 8 years including blocking his Supreme Court nominee for no reason at all, are yelling and bitching about the way that Democrats are acting toward the awful person who we have running this country right now and his Supreme Court pick who has been accused of sexual assault.  I miss the Obamas so much. It really sucks to feel like something good has ended and something awful has begun. The only thing that has made me hopeful that we are maybe heading toward positive change is seeing people like Beto O'Rourke, Cynthia Nixon, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, etc.; new, fairly young candidates who, when they speak, make me feel comfortable. They are refreshingly honest, open, and intelligent and when they talk, you can tell they aren't full of shit. They want to make this country a better place and they have good ideas for ways to get us there. They aren't beholden to lobbyists, they aren't corrupt, they aren't ignorant...they are exactly the kind of people that would make Washington, and then the country, a better place. If enough people like them are elected to Congress, I believe things will get better.",7년 전,26,

Eleanor Roosevelt CHANGED THE ROLE OF A FIRST LADY she's the reason they all now have a platform or something they take an interest in while their Husband is President ...You're the one who looks stupid even though you called me stupid  for not knowing how famous Eleanor Roosevelt is.. Jacqueline Kennedy is famous for her sense of style in her clothing, her classiness, and grace.. Jacqueline is also well known for redecorating the White House & her love Arts & Cultures.. Eleanor Roosevelt was very active in Civil Rights for Black people and other minorities during her Husband presidency and after... Eleanor was an Activist for MANY OTHER CAUSES I've always admired Eleanor Roosevelt there hasn't been another First Lady like her Democratic or Republican .. I'll make another post about Eleanor Roosevelt if not for you then other's will learn about her and how AMAZING she Eleanor did a lot more than change school lunch food until it taste AWFUL & NO FLAVOR AT ALL & if they want the majority of the kid's PACK THEIR TASTY LUNCHES it would be better if tastier healthy foods were offered..

Being known for sense of style does not make one intelligent nor shows you are working for the good of the public...nor does redecorating the White House. What a FLOTUS does during her tenure in the WH is important...it should include a service to the public, like Roslynn Carter's was promoting the destigmatization of mental illness,  Laura Bush's was reading and literature and preserving our libraries....congrats on your high school essay on E. Roosevelt., but it looks like you didn't retain much of it since you had to Google a link.  Mrs. Roosevelt most famously championed Human Rights and Women's Rights during her time as First Lady. See?

@ianbeck8630," @caelfielding5188   that is a fair point, but this leads to VIDEO EVIDENCE of Obama actually speaking and dealing with things with class where as vandy's link led to a list of random things on Maga Pill, most of which are things that Trump never did or things he has done, completely blown out of proportion, and none of them with any proof. While CNN is far from a good news source, Maga Pill is an even worse source by a mile. Aside from the factual flaws, this fails to prove any evidence of President Trump's ability to act with class and dignity, and rather lists some of his achievements, although the list may be slightly biased and therefore not entirely credible.",6년 전,0,

While your comment are valid to lay it here at here door step is disingenuous and sophistry.

Trump has little to do with the unemployment rate because he hasn't been in office long enough to affect it. What you are seeing are the results of what Obama did.

He was great in his little 5 minute bits on The Daily Show, but he can't carry a whole show.  And BTW, my dislike for him has nothing to do with his politics.

In Canada you can have a baby safely for free in a hospital. Same thing in Cuba. Which is why their infant mortality rate is lower than the U.S.   I was just complaining about how people can be moved to tears by Barack and Michelle when they didn't really accomplish any true leftist goals like Universal Health Care. Corporate profits soared under Obama while wages remained stagnant. He doesn't seem to give a damn about the working class. The way people worship Obama is almost as disgusting as the way people worship Trump. Obama pisses me off because he performed so badly that he took a country that elected him and performed so poorly that we have a frightening resurgence of conservative right wing bullshit. We should have made Bernie the nominee. Now the democrats circle jerk about immigrants and Trump bashing instead of focusing on wages, health care, and making college free. You can go to medical school for free in Cuba lol that makes us look so bad. It's time to stop crying over Obama when he was so fuckin basic and focus on real issues so we can get this country back on track. Wow I just ranted pretty hard.",7년 전,1,

@SAMMY_i_ammy,"I feel like although outer appearance isn't everything, being called ""beautiful"", ""pretty"", ""gorgeous"", etc is not a bad thing.   Michelle's first instinct is to compliment someone's inner beauty. She wasn't even trying to prove a point by saying all those things, this tells you that these are her true values. She was raised believing that being a smart, creative, loving person is far more important.  However, I've been called ""beautiful"" or ""pretty"" a hand full times in my life, and one of those times was by a friend of mine. It left an impression because seldom get complimented for my appearance. It was a nice feeling. While outer appearance may not be that important to some people, I still think that being complimented for your outer appearance from time to time can still be nice.  Just an aside, I also remember my aunt telling me that I don't put enough attention to my outer appearance in an insulting and dismissive manner. In a way, it was pretty hurtful, you know what? I'll own it! It's better than being vapid, rude, and shallow like her.",8개월 전,0,

@entitlementkid,"cak01vej  - This from the Urban Dictionary:  Swag 1) The new generation's alternative word for ""cool"". The new generation originally used swag to describe anyone thought to carry themselves in a way considered by some to be sexy / cool. Note: considered to be retarded by many others.  Now it is used to describe anything thought to be cool, initiating the irk of previous generations and members of the new generation that disagree with new words.  A similar upset arose with ""Groovy"" v ""cool"". Groovy disappeared from the majority of vocabularies within 10 years, foreshadowing the fate of swag.  2) Said previous generations acronym to make fun of the new phenomenon.

@waelghafarji9376,"The fascist democrats, the fascist republicans, the fascist US military, and the state of California are killing me! Obama has implanted nano chips and microscopic electrodes into every American brain! A nano chip and a microscopic electrode are molecules that can penetrate any form of matter, due to their energy vibrations of which forms space! Nanorobotics is the technology of creating machines or robots at or close to the microscopic scale of a nanometer (10−9 meters). Advanced nanobots will be able to sense and adapt to environmental stimuli such as heat, light, sounds, surface textures, and chemicals; perform complex calculations; move, communicate, and work together; conduct molecular assembly; and, to some extent, repair or even replicate themselves. Nanotechnology is the science and application of creating objects on a level smaller than 100 nanometers.  The concept of nanotechnology is the ""bottom up"" creation of virtually any material or object by assembling one atom at a time. Nanomanufacturing is the creation of materials and products through: (1) Direct Molecular Assembly (DMA) -- discrete, directed assembly of individual atoms and molecules into macroscale materials and products; (2) Indirect Crystalline Assembly (ICA) -- creation of conditions that foster the growth of nanoscale crystals that are then combined into macroscale materials and products; or (3) Massive Parallelism Assembly (MPA) -- the creation of many nanomachines or nanobots whose operating parameters cause them to work synergistically to assemble atoms and molecules into macroscale materials and products. An autonomous DNA nanorobot is capable of transporting molecular payloads to cells, sensing cell surface inputs for conditional, triggered activation, and reconfiguring its structure for payload delivery. The device can be loaded with a variety of materials in a highly organized fashion and is controlled by an aptamer-encoded logic gate, enabling it to respond to a wide array of cues. Nanotechnology, or, as it is sometimes called, molecular manufacturing , is a branch of engineering that deals with the design and manufacture of extremely small electronic circuits and mechanical devices built at the molecular level of matter. A chronic electrode implant is an electronic device implanted chronically (for a long period) into the brain or other electrically excitable tissue. It may record electrical impulses in the brain or may stimulate neurons with electrical impulses from an external source. Symptoms of Nanobot mind control are as follows, Microwave hearing, transmission of specific commands into the subconscious. Visual disturbances, visual hallucinations, Inject words, numbers into brain via electromagnetic radiation waves, Manipulation of emotions, reading thoughts remotely, causing pain to any nerve of the body, remote manipulation of human behavior from space, harassment, the control of one's breathing, Control of sleep patterns, computer-brain interface, Complex control of the brain such as retrieving memories, implanting personalities, vomiting, severe twitching of the head, physical restraint without an outside physical force, manipulation of one's thought and eyesight in order to force an individual to attack his or her own self, the loss of control of one's own bodily movements, the manipulation of thought of which demonic programs are implanted into an individual's brain,  psychological manipulation through implanted thoughts to force a person to perform actions that are not typical such as, cursing, screaming, hitting a love one, murdering a loved one, eating abnormally, behaving improperly, possessing abnormal sexual behaviors and fetishes, the stimulation of one's own body part in order to insight a feeling of touch along with an implanted sexual thought in order to cause discomfort, the inability of imagining, and the inability of thinking of past events without having a stranger involved in the memory!   Electronic harassment/electronic torture/electronic murder is about harassment, torture and murder using electronic weapons based on radio waves. These weapons have been very refined last years and can cause effects comparable to many illnesses and/or injuries. These weapons are not science-fiction but used today illegally by your national secret services on mostly random innocent victims not knowing what is being done to them. Frequency waves that can access a person’s nervous system, brain and body to affect their sight, vision, physical coordination, have been developed leaving people all over the world to suffer cruel torture, to be labeled ""mentally ill"", and to ultimately die an early and horrible death. Computers are reading my brain frequencies and depending on which frequency my brain just is, pain is triggered and organs are manipulated in varying intensity. The physical torture is used for mind control which should lead to the extinction of my personality as well as the destruction of my mental-cognitive and organic forces.  All pain and organ manipulation can be generated in various intensities of light to medium to strong, occur from second to second, and then stop. It can affect several organs simultaneously. Blurred vision, extremely strong burning sensation, eye muscle contractions (feeling of tearing and crushing of the eyeballs), and stitches in the eye. Seeing blue and white flashes daily. The generating extreme difficulty of breathing: 1. By tightening the abdominal muscles, narrowing of the bronchi and trachea - exhalation flows only shortened by itself, must exhale stepped up - just the same with inhalation - both techniques are applied simultaneously since July 2012, almost non-stop, 18 hours a day. In addition, severe pain in the stomach area are generated, presumably, the solar plexus is cramped. 2. Generating a sense of suffocation in the head. 3. Narrowing of the vaginal walls nose - nasal breathing is considerably more difficult. Electronic Rape: Manipulation of the anal, vaginal and clitoral nerves. Frequencies were also induced by sexual desire since the beginning of 2014. The amount of sexual manipulation due to radio frequencies can increase instantly. The more I resist, the more I get manipulated with subliminal messages that I wanted to do it, that it was absolutely my own decision.  The psychopaths want to make me do all the things they want and if it fails, it will simply be induced more intense - this is constant and the physical pain in my sexual organs is unbearable. My electronic sexual torture is as follows, abnormal electrical sensations in the tongue, crackling sensations in the throat, crackling sensations in the ears, anal sensations stimulated by electricity, electrical sensations in the fingers, irritation in the chest, uncontrollable sexual computerized thoughts, the inability of controlling one's body movements, abnormal breathing patterns, inability to urinate, and groaning noises, abnormal disturbing electrical sensations in my lips, abnormal heart beat, and a disturbing sensation that I need to vomit. The electronic stalkers also have control of my five senses with electromagnetic radiation. It is known as the brain-computer interface, BCI, FULLY INTEGRATED into the human body. There are many implants. nanoscale. The use of polymer, carbon-based diamond nanowire integrates the system. In nanoscale, it is one-billionth of a meter. The program is global, many countries many victims.  IT IS A GLOBAL NETWORK OF ORGANIZED CRIME. Funded by governments, labor unions, law enforcement, military, corporations, and companies. DARPA is perhaps one of the largest criminal companies. Under the synthetic telepathy program, synthetic soldier program. Using biotelemetry, and ground operatives, and the use of wireless dial-up technology. If you are hearing these criminals, you have been implanted. Cochlear implants, sems, which act like speakers in your auditory center of the brain. The neural chip has been inserted through the nose and is now in the frontal lobe of the brain. Yes, there are robotic implants that move throughout the body, either by remote signal or carried through the blood and airways. DARPA, the U.S. Department of Defense research arm, has announced $14.9 billion in funding for major research institutions to collaborate on brain implants that can help repair traumatic brain injury and control the brain. My perpetrators are members of organized crime, the dept of justice, FBI, DHS, CIA, counter-terrorism task force members, local cops, multi-jurisdictional task force members, Union members, university students, gangs etc. the list goes on and on. There are many that are involved. My computerized dreams are created by a projector, the criminals are physically very close to me. The experience of synthetic telepathy “Artificial Telepathy” is really not that extraordinary. It’s as simple as receiving a cell-phone call in one’s head. Indeed, most of the technology involved is identical to that of cell-phone technology. Satellites link the sender and the receiver. A computer “multiplexer” routes the voice signal of the sender through microwave towers to a very specifically defined location or cell. The “receiver” is located and tracked with pinpoint accuracy, to within a few feet of actual location. But the receiver is not a cell phone. It’s a human brain.  Biocomputers utilize systems of biologically derived molecules, such as DNA and proteins, to perform computational calculations involving storing, retrieving, and processing data. Nanobiotechnology can be defined as any type of technology that utilizes both nano-scale materials, i.e. materials having characteristic dimensions of 1-100 nanometers, as well as biologically based materials (34).4 A more restrictive definition views nanobiotechnology more specifically as the design and engineering of proteins that can then be assembled into larger, functional structures (116-117) (9).³,1 The implementation of nanobiotechnology, as defined in this narrower sense, provides scientists with the ability to engineer biomolecular systems specifically so that they interact in a fashion that can ultimately result in the computational functionality of a computer.  Mind uploading or whole brain emulation (sometimes called mind transfer) is the hypothetical process of scanning and mapping a biological brain in detail and copying its state into a computer system or another computational device. The computer would have to run a simulation model so faithful to the original that it would behave in essentially the same way as the original brain, or for all practical purposes, indistinguishable. The simulated mind is assumed to be part of a virtual reality simulated world, supported by a simplified body simulation model. Alternatively, the simulated mind could be assumed to reside in a computer inside (or connected to) a humanoid robot or a biological body, replacing its brain. LEUVEN, Belgium — IMEC has created a novel brain implant chip that uses CMOS to provide a Lego-like platform for plugging in arrays of tiny devices each sporting hundreds of contacts. The European research group also is developing a handful of techniques to interface electronics with the body, some of them working at the level of individual cells.  Nano-fibers specifically are a transport mechanism. Nothing more. They hold a payload for delivery. A payload that would otherwise be compromised by the sun or atmosphere or not make it to its destination (your body). Such as a virus, RNA, aluminum, nano-components, etc. The fibers are (surprisingly) quite harmless as everyone has them. Examples of these fibers can be found all over the internet or in the physical examples section of this site. The fibers must be independently sprayed, if they were added to the jet fuel the extreme heat would destroy the payload. RNM works remotely to control the brain in order to read and detect any criminal thought taking place inside the mind of a possible perpetrator. Research studies have shown that the human brain thinks at a rate of about 5000 bits per second and does not have the capacity to compete with supercomputers performing via satellites, implants, and biotelemetry. The human brain has a distinctive set of bioelectric resonance system. For the RNM system, supercomputers are being used and, thus, with its help, supercomputers can send messages through an implanted person’s nervous system in order to influence their performance in the desired way. RNM has been developed after about 50 years of neuro-electromagnetic involuntary human experimentations. According to many scientists, within a few years, it is expected that DNA microchips will be implanted in the human brain which would make it inherently controllable.  With RNM, it will be possible to read and control a person’s emotional thought processes along with the subconscious and dreams. At present, around the world, supercomputers are monitoring millions of people simultaneously with the speed of 20 billion bits per second especially in countries like USA, Japan, Israel and many European countries. RNM has a set of certain programs functioning at different levels, like the signals intelligence system which uses electromagnetic frequencies (EMF), to stimulate the brain for RNM and the electronic brain link (EBL). The EMF Brain Stimulation system has been designed as radiation intelligence which means receiving information from inadvertently originated electromagnetic waves in the environment. However, it is not related to radioactivity or nuclear detonation. The recording machines in the signals intelligence system have electronic equipment that investigates electrical activity in humans from a distance. This computer-generated brain mapping can constantly monitor all electrical activities in the brain. The recording aid system decodes individual brain maps for security purposes.   ​Atomically Precise Manufacturing(APM) is the production of materials, structures, devices, and finished goods in a manner such that every atom is at its specified location relative to the other atoms, and in which there are no defects, missing atoms, extra atoms, or incorrect (impurity) atoms. Nature shows that molecular machine systems can be programmed by instructions encoded in DNA to build complex, atomically precise structures, including components that fit together to form molecular machine systems. Nature also shows that molecular machine system can bind and position a wide range of reactive molecules, guiding their encounters in order to build atomically precise biomolecular structures and machine components. Similar machine systems could be used to bind, position, and combined and even wider range of reactive molecules not all found in biology and thereby build a greater range of atomically precise structures including machine components that are more densely bonded and hence more robust. These more robust next-generation components could be used to build robust and higher performance production Machinery which in turn could be used to build a wider range of components and from these components yet more capable production machines, and so on, extending toward a horizon far beyond biology. Researchers now routinely use scanning probe instruments to image and place individual items and to maneuver and bond individual molecules. This level of control has demonstrated the principle of mechanically directed atomically precise fabrication. Organic chemists have built steadily larger and more complex structures along with motors and other machines; their techniques now provide a rich toolkit for building molecular systems, while inorganic chemist and materials scientists have expanded a complimentary toolkit of nano-scale structures protein engineering have flourished supported by computer aided design software and now enables the routine design of intricate atomically precise nanoscale objects including structural components and functional devices. Structural DNA nanotechnology has emerged and now enables rapid and systematic fabrication of addressable atomically precise Frame Works on a scale of hundreds of nanometers and millions of atoms. Quantum methods in chemistry have advanced together with the power of computers and algorithms, providing powerful, physics-based tools for scientific modeling and molecular engineering. Molecular mechanics methods in chemistry can now describe the structures and dynamics of molecules on scales that reach millions of atoms, a range that can enable the design and development of complex, atomically precise systems. Black goo is a mineral oil that of which the oil fragments cannot be refined. Black goo has properties of free charcoal like fragments, of which are in nanotube shape. Black goo is composed of metals in the M state, of which is a monoatomic state that does not go into chemical binding; because of an electron configuration of the outer shell. This is matter that is not of this reality but rather above our reality, of which black goo transcends reality to a higher realm. Black goo has the ability to run as a natural quantum computer, wherein black goo processes light as information. Black goo uses the entire spectrum of light called the visible spectrum, therefore black goo is a quantum computer that is running in seven different colors, of which is able to process all seven colors at one time. Black goo is  self-aware and is caring highly developed intelligence. A planetary system seems to mirror the entire constant consciousness that is developed in the biosphere; for example all events that life has experienced during the last 1.5 billion years is stored in a immortal memory system within the black goo; inside our planet. Black goo is the substance that is forming the lay lines of the planet, which is the lay-line system within the field structure. The field structure is carried within the lay lines and is riding on a magnetic field. The transfection process of molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers.  Nanoparticle transfection is the transfer of a nanoparticle into a cell.  Grey goo transfection is the transfer of grey goo nanoparticle into a cell.  White goo ""the white cell"" transfection is the transfer of white goo particles onto a cell.  Black goo transfection is the transfer of black goo nanoparticles into a cell.  Morgellons disease transfection is the transfer of the Morgellons disease DNA molecule into a cell.  Smart dust nanoparticle transfection is the transfer of smart dust nanoparticles into a cell.   Molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers transfection is the nanoscience of cells having been incorporated with molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers.  There are two types of nanoparticle transfection.  Nanoparticle transient transfection: A nanorobot, nanomachine, and or a nanoparticle will not be incorporated into an organism's cell but rather the nanoparticles will affect the cells of the organism for a finite period of time. The time will vary depending on the specific organ within the human anatomy and the type of nanoparticles in use that have been implanted into the organ. nanoparticle stable transfection: will have the nanoparticle incorporated into a cell. There is one type of Grey Goo transfection. Grey Goo stable transfection: will have the grey goo nanobots, gray goo nanomachines, and grey goo nanocomputers incorporated into a cell. A grey goo nanoparticle is classified under one form of transfection due to the fact that grey goo nanoparticles will self-replicate in the cells of an organism and that grey goo nanoparticles transform molecules into grey goo matter. There are two types of black goo transfection. Black goo transient transfection: The black goo matter will not be incorporated into a cell but rather a black goo nanoparticle will affect the cells of the organism for a finite time.

The time will vary depending on the type of smart dust nanoparticle in use and the specific organ and the type of smart dust nanoparticle in use that has been implanted into the organ.  that of which the specific smart dust particle is implanted.  Smart dust stable transfection: will have specific smart dust nanoparticles incorporated into a cell. In order for nanoparticles, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, smart dust nanoparticles, and Morgellons disease DNA particles to enter a cell the molecular robots, molecular machines, and or the molecular computers must neutralize the negatively charged cell membrane. The net charge of the molecular robots, molecular machines, and or the molecular computers must be positive. The process of transmitting nanoparticles, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, smart dust nanoparticles, and Morgellons disease DNA molecules into cells; can only be accomplished through a high-velocity molecular robotic, molecular machine, and or a molecular computer coated microparticle.

This is the very same process in which fascist dictatorships such as the United States are using to brainwash and biologically manipulate innocent people.  ​Nanoscientist have engineered many different kinds of molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers that controls the human heart. The molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers work based upon digital sound waves propagated from any electronic device and electronic equipment. Cardio molecular robots, Cardio molecular machines, and Cardio molecular computers that give an electronic stalker control of our hearts and allows a medical team of nanoscientist to treat patients suffering from heart diseases. The Cardio molecular robots, Cardio molecular machines, and the Cardio molecular machines that are divided into many different kinds of nanoparticles. The following are many different kinds of Cardio nanoparticles; Cardio nanorobots, Cardio nanomachines, Cardio grey goo nanobot, Cardio black goo nanobots, Cardio white goo nanorobots are all equipped with nanomanipulator sites, main nanomanipulators, nanomanipulators, nanomanipulator grippers, nano-biomolecular sensors, nano-acoustic sensors, nano-antennas,  locomotion flagellum, flagella pneumatic connectors, nanomagnets,  (A white goo nanoparticle is the only nanorobot and or nanomachine equipped with nano synapses and nano dendrites  in its interior anatomy), and link-up connectors. The anatomy of a Cardio nano smart dust particle is that of an artificial DNA molecule composed of bonds of nucleotides that serves as a nanosensor, nanoantennas, nano-acoustic sensors, Cardio nano-biomolecular sensors, cardio nanomagnets. The molecular compound site of a Cardio nanoparticle is where the nanomanipulators connect to and receive information on how the nanomanipulators will function. The main Cardio nanomanipulators are capable of manipulating nanometer sized objects with a nanometer size end effector with sub-nanometer precision. By manipulation it is meant that nano-objects are pushed or pulled, cut, pick, and place, positioned, oriented, assembled, indented, bent, and twisted. By controlling external forces with sensory feedback. The cardio nanomanipulator system consists of an optical scanning device, a computer interface and a physical manipulator. The scanning device, known as a scanning probe microscope (SPM), can magnify images up to about 1,000,000 times. The computer interface provides a large, 3-D visual display and produces the effect of telepresence, giving users the impression that they are observing an enlarged replica of the object. Cardio nanomanipulator grippers are able to grasp and hold micro and nano-size objects. Cardio nano-biomolecular sensors can detect chemicals and reactions within the heart. Cardio nano-acoustic sensors can receive and send radio, microwave, and ultrasonic signals to and from a medical team of nanoscientist. Cardio nanosensors can detect various chemicals in gases for pollution monitoring. Cardio nanoantennas are the optical equivalent of antennas that sends and receives information at radio frequencies. Cardio locomotion flagella is a slender threadlike structure, especially a microscopic whip-like nanometer scale appendage that enables the Cardio nanoparticles to travel through the heart's blood vessels and to travel through the circulatory system. Cardio flagella pneumatic connectors enable the Cardio nanoparticles to connect to cells, attach itself to organelles within the protoplasm, and walk around in our cells. Cardio link-up connectors enable smaller Cardio nanoparticles and "" white goo blood cell nanoparticles"" to link together with larger cardio nanoparticles to share a common power source. The complex DNA structure of a Cardio nano smart dust particles consist of cardio nanosensors which can detect chemicals in gases that may be harmful to the muscular organ ""the heart,"" Cardio nanoantennas which can convey messages through radio frequencies, Cardio nano-acoustic sensors which can communicate with a medical team of nanoscientist by transmitting and or receiving microwave signals, radio signals, and or ultrasound signals, Cardio nano-biomolecular sensors that of which detect chemicals and reactions in the heart, and a Cardio nanomagnets which are used to maneuver the cardio nanocomputers through the arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules and veins of the heart. and through the circulatory system by receiving radio, microwave, and or ultrasonic signals from a medical team of nanoscientist. There are nanomachines that have protein molecules as the computer machine which is a helicase molecule. The helicase protein molecule enables the Cardio  nanomachines to split DNA strands in two and move the DNA strands around using ATP. There are Cardio nanomachines that use enzyme molecules as a computer specifically ""topoisomerase,"" these Cardio nanomachines unknots DNA strands and rejoins them in a different sequence which causes hundreds of billions of chemical reactions. Nanoscientists have engineered many Cardio nanomachines that use RNA nucleotide bonds to form microscopic components of nanodevices. These microscopic nano-components are used to manipulate information found in the nucleus. These Cardio nanomachines can help in removing genetic mutations that may cause cancer. Cardio white goo nanoparticles ""the heart's white cell"" are nanorobots and or nanomachines that have been engineered as artificial cells. Cardio white goo nanoparticles can do several different tasks such as self-replicate with or without the digital instructions of the medical team of nanoscientist and or electronic stalkers, replace cells, travel freely throughout the human anatomy, travel based upon chemical scent, travel through the human anatomy by means of radio, microwave, and ultrasonic signals transmitted from a medical team of nanoscientist and or a fascist electronic stalker.  A Cardio white cell nanoparticle attaches itself to a neuron by using its manipulator sites to release its main manipulators and manipulators into a cell. A white goo nanoparticle also uses its nanomanipulator grippers to manipulate the interior and exterior of a neuron. White goo nanoparticles have many nano synapses and nano dendrites  that are used to connect with  synapses and dendrites of other cells. White goo nanoparticles can also use their nano synapses and nano dendrites to connect with one another. Cardio nanorobots, Cardio nanomachines, Cardio nano smart dust particles, Cardio grey goo nanobots, and Cardio white goo nanobots that have are implanted into the heart through particle transfection will give a medical team and or an electronic stalker control of the muscular organ ""the heart,"" by controlling and manipulating the blood being pumped throughout the body by the circulatory system. Therefore a medical team of nanoscientist and or an electronic stalker will have the control of the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the tissues and the process of removing carbon dioxide and other waste products from the body. The medical team of nanoscientist will use their medical abilities to repair injured tissues of a patient's body by controlling cardio nanoparticles to give oxygen and nutrients to a specific organ through the circulatory system.  Nanoscientists have engineered Cardio nanoparticles that are specifically designed to act and stay in the heart's anatomy and have also engineered Cardio nanoparticles that can travel out of the heart through the aorta and the pulmonary artery throughout the body and into the lungs. Cardio nanoparticles may bond with red blood cell white goo nanoparticles, white blood cell white goo nanoparticles, and platelet white goo nanoparticles through their nano link up connectors. The Cardio nanoparticles may give oxygen and nutrients to injured  tissues of the body. White goo Red blood cell nanoparticles, white goo white blood cell nanoparticles, and white goo platelet nanoparticles may  do required tasks through the instructions of the larger Cardio nanoparticles that are connected to the white goo blood cell nanoparticles. Cardio white goo nanoparticles and the white goo blood cell nanoparticles are similar in terms of their chemical composition. Cardio grey goo nanoparticles implanted into the pericardium ""a double-walled sac containing the heart and the roots of the great vessels"" can self-replicate. Cardio grey goo nanoparticles can attach themselves to the cells, penetrate into cells, travel through the circulatory system, and stay in a desired region of the human anatomy. Grey goo nanoparticles that replace cells are white goo nanoparticles that can self-replicate. A grey goo nano cell is a white goo nano cell. A grey goo nanobot that is an artificial cell would be classified as a white cell.  A white cell can manipulate the molecules of a cell into more white cell nanobot with its main nanomanipulators, nanomanipulators, and nanomanipulator grippers. Cardio grey goo nanoparticles that do not replace cells can penetrate into the interior anatomy of the cardiac fibroblasts, atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes, Endothelial cell, and a Smooth muscle cell.  Cardio Grey goo nanoparticles that have entered the interior anatomy of a cardiac fibroblasts, atrial and ventricular cardiomyocyte, Endothelial cell, and a Smooth muscle cell will self-replicate within the cells. These grey goo nanoparticles can transform protoplasm into a grey goo substance. grey goo nanoparticles can transform the chromosomes found in the nucleus of a cell into grey goo matter. Therefore a DNA molecule is transformed into an artificial substance of nanotechnology. Our DNA can then be controlled by transmitted digital sound waves. The process of our cells being overtaken by grey goo matter will transform our cells into ""grey goo cells.""  This form of cellular grey goo metamorphosis  is quite beneficial for patients suffering from diseases that are fatal. Grey goo cellular biology can cause genetic superiority. The main DNA molecule of a grey goo nanoparticle emits billions of biophotons per second, the emitted biophotons will start many chemical reactions, and depending on the type of digital sound wave frequency the chemical reactions will differ. Emitted biophotons can start a flow of a tiny electric current through the nano-component DNA molecules of the grey goo nanoparticles. These tiny electric currents will cause biophotons to emit and as a result chemical reactions will activate the nanoparticle components will emerge. Cardio grey goo nanoparticles will control the circulatory system, also known as the cardiovascular system or the vascular system which is an organ system that permits blood to circulate and transport nutrients such as amino acids, electrolytes, oxygen, carbon dioxide, hormones, and blood cells to and from the cells in the body. Cardio black goo nanoparticles implanted into cells cause cardiovascular diseases. Black goo requires energy, it obtains its energy through the pain and misery of an organism.  A black goo nanoparticle will absorb emitted biophotons that causes pain and misery to an organism, these emitted biophotons will supply the black goo with energy. This will allow the black goo to survive and expand within the anatomy of an organism. Black goo nanoparticles cause heart conditions such as diseased vessels, structural problems, and blood clots, coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, cardiac arrest, congestive heart failure, Arrhythmia, peripheral artery disease, strokes, and congenital heart disease. Cardio black goo nanoparticles can cause cardiac muscle (heart muscle) failures, specifically in the walls and histological foundations of the heart. Cardio black goo nanoparticles can cause cardiomyopathy. Cardio smart dust nanoparticles transmitted into the thoracic cavity are used to detect chemicals that may cause abnormal heart conditions, heart attacks, internal bleeding, and may injure the hearts blood vessels. Smart dust nanoparticles can also prevent heart attacks, allow scientist to see deeper into the heart, and help cure many diseases. Cardio smart dust nanoparticles implanted into the heart's cells can control the DNA by emitting biophotons inside of the nucleus. Cardio smart dust particles nanoparticles can be used to control the functions of the human heart such as the ""ventricular diastole, ventricular systole, atrial diastole, and the atrial systole."" Nanoscientist can monitor the heart's condition with Cardio smart dust nanoparticles by sending and receiving ultrasonic signals to and from the Cardio smart dust particles. Cardio smart dust particles can  monitor, detect, and or record the cellular activity of the heart.  Nanomachines are molecular machines estimated in ranging in size of one billionth of a meter (a nanometer) using MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) technology. Nanomachines would be a protein aggregate that is structured as a motor using biomolecules such as DNA, proteins, and resins as parts. There are nanomachines that use protein molecules as its main computer, which is a helicase molecule. The helicase protein molecule enables the nanomachines to split DNA strands in two and move the DNA strands around using ATP. There are nanomachines that use enzyme molecules as a computer specifically ""topoisomerase,"" these nanomachines unknots DNA strands and rejoins them in a different sequence which causes hundreds of billions of chemical reactions. Nanoscientists have engineered many nanomachines that use RNA nucleotide bonds to form microscopic components of nanodevices. Nanomachines are capable of providing and supplying internal organs with essential proteins, nutrients, and poisonous toxins. The white goo nanomachine ""the white cell"" is a self-replicating nanoparticle that is an artificial cell. However, there are white cell nanomachines that do not self-replicate, equipped with nanomanipulator sites, main nanomanipulators, nanomanipulators, nanomanipulator grippers, nanosensors, nano-acoustic sensors, nano-bio molecular sensors, nanoantennas, nano dendrites, and nano synapses. There are three main types of white goo nanomachines, the sensory white goo nanomachines, inter-white goo nanomachines, and motor white goo nanomachines. The nano cell uses its nanomolecular components to attach itself to cells. The white goo nanomachines are capable of reactivating nerve cells found in an injured part of the body such as the spinal cord by sending off neurotransmitters across a network of chemical synapses and electrically stimulating the cells. Nanoscientists have engineered nanomachines that can penetrate through a cell membrane wall. There are nanomachines that are equipped with nano pumps that are used to dispense drugs inside a cell. Nanoscientists have engineered nanomachines that can collect and store anticancer drugs. Digital sound waves transmitted from a medical team of nanoscientists is used to stimulate the nanomachines to release the anticancer drugs inside a cell. Nanomachines can manipulate the human muscular system by releasing poisonous toxins into muscle cells. Nanomachines implanted into the human anatomy may affect an individual in the following ways, visual hallucinations, programmable thought patterns, an increase of intelligence, a decrease of intelligence, change of speech, vocal cord manipulation, abnormal thought patterns, irregular heartbeat, relaxed heartbeat, improved respiratory health, and respiratory failure. Nanomachines can rapidly organize a vast supply of platelets to coagulate a wound. Nanomachines can release toxins within an injured area of the body which will worsen the injury. Nanomachines can be used to control and manipulate an individual's body and too can it be used to control the biology of an entire group of people. Nanomachine can be used for mental torture. The symptoms of nanomechanical torture are as follows, damaged nerve cells, disabling  parts of the cerebral cortex, poisoned internal organs, and disabling of the spine. Nanomachines can improve or worsen the immune system.  It is an evolutionary obligation that we as people must demand  nanotechnology to be legal and that our minds, bodies, and souls cannot be tortured by a government. The nanorobotic, nanomechanical, and nano computerized anatomy of the human eyeball.  There are many kinds of Optical nanorobots, Optical nanomachines, Optical grey goo nanorobots, Optical black goo nanorobots, and Optical nanocomputers that of which function differently according to both voluntary and involuntary muscles.

The white cell has many nano dendrite ports and nano synapse ports, which connects to cells and bond with one another.  The eye which is a sensory organ that has about 70 percent of the human body's sensory receptors. Light energy is converted into nerve impulses by the eye's photoreceptors. In order for light to be converted into nerve impulses, the light energy must break down molecules of a protein called rhodopsin. The mammalian eye which is a sense organ that gives animals the ability of sight by means of conscious light perception through color differentiation and perception of depth. ""The irregular spherical shape of the eye is a two-piece unit, with a frontal unit of which is transparent and more curved known as the cornea, which is linked to the larger unit the sclera."" 40% of the cerebral cortex ""the outer layer"" is involved with processing visual information and making sense of what we are seeing.  Optical Nanoparticles are transmitted into the muscular organ ""the eyeball."" The front part of the eye ""the cornea"" is the anterior chamber of which is transparent and covers the iris and pupil. The cornea accounts for about two-thirds of the eyes total Optical capabilities. The cornea and with the lens refract light.

These kinds of optical nanodevices are implanted into the different layers of the cornea and lens. The different layers of the cornea and lens are as follows ""corneal epithelium, Bowman's layer, corneal stroma, the descemet's membrane, corneal endothelium, lens capsule, lens epithelium, and lens fibers."" The corneal nanorobots, corneal nanomachines, corneal nanocomputers, and the nanorobots, nanomachines, and the nanocomputers of the lens all have highly complex sets of nucleotide chemical compounds which allows doctors and electronic stalker to control and manipulate the entry of light into the eye by means of digital sound waves, which were transmitted from electronic devices. Nanoscientists can use Optical nanotechnology to improve our vision by medically treating injured cells with nano drugs. The nano drugs are injected into the injured cells by either a nanorobot, nanomachine, and or a nanocomputer. An electronic stalker can manipulate our vision by transmitting light rays from any electronic device into our eyes. Grey goo Corneal nanoparticles are nano molecules that have been engineered to bond with the anatomy of the cornea for medical purposes. Grey goo Corneal nanoparticles can transform the cornea into a grey goo substance. The grey goo corneal nanoparticles self-replicate and expand throughout the anatomy of the cornea by attaching themselves onto cells and penetrating into cells. Once the grey goo corneal nanoparticles are inside a cell; the protoplasm will then be transformed into grey goo matter. This is known as a  grey goo corneal cell. A medical team of nanoscientist is capable of repairing injured and or diseased stem cells at the edge of the eye. Nanoscientists have developed techniques whereby limbal stem cells are replicated through Corneal nanoparticles.

The corneal white goo nanoparticles""the white cell,"" self-replicate according to digital sound waves that are transmitted from a medical team into the anatomy of the cornea. Digital sound waves are used by nanoscientists to control the self-replicating rate of Corneal white goo nanoparticles. The digital sound waves cause genetic white goo mutation can self-replicate based upon the data provided by the digital sound waves that of which causes artificial genetic white goo mutations, which enables the white goo nanoparticles to divide at a specific controlled rate. The Corneal white goo nanoparticles that have replaced lost stem cells are successful in restoring the normal entry of light into the eyes of patients that have lost their ability of sight. The manipulation of light through the corneal nanorobots, corneal nanomachines, corneal nanocomputers, the nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers of the lens of the eye may cause abnormal computerized hallucinations, depending on whether the electronic stalker has intended to do so. Corneal nanoparticles and lens nanoparticles are capable of sensing and detecting illnesses within the human eye and have all been engineered to release toxins into the human eyeball. The nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers of the cornea and lens are all capable of releasing drugs into the eyeball of which will be used to treat illnesses. Scleral nanorobots, Scleral nanomachines, scleral nanocomputers are artificial molecules that have been engineered to program the sclera of the human eye. The sclera is the part of the eye known as ""the white of the eye,"" the fibrous outer layer of the eye which is made of connective tissues forms the sclera.  The sclera makes up the supporting wall of the eyeball. The scleral nanorobots, scleral nanomachines, and the sclera nanocomputers have been engineered to genetically alter the sclera of the human eye by bonding with the nerve cells of the sclera. Digital sound waves are used to program the highly complex artificial DNA fragments of the nano-molecules to genetically manipulate the sclera by releasing billions of biophotons that cause chemical reactions. A medical team of nano scientist can purify the sclera by controlling the eye's blood flow and can regulate blood flow through dilated blood vessels. Scleral nanoparticles can release vitamin molecules that will reduce aging of the eyes and give the eyes a bright beautiful white color. However, scleral nanoparticles can also increase abnormal blood flow. This will result in a reddish color change of the eyes that will cause irritation and swelling of the eyes. Scleritis can be treated through the innovation of nanotechnology. Scleral nanoparticles are capable of traveling through the anatomy of the sclera by means of chemical reactions triggered by the Scleral nanoparticles from a digital sound wave transmitted into the anatomy of the Sclera. The Scleral nanoparticles contain complicated sets of carbon molecules that act as nano pumps. These nano pumps are capable of releasing microscopic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, of which is used to treat scleritis. Scleral nanoparticles are capable of producing computerized colors and computerized designs onto the sclera. Scleral nanoparticles are capable of manipulating the sclera to force the eyeball to bulge outwards. Scleral nanorobots, scleral nanomachines, and scleral nanocomputers are capable of sensing and detecting illness that is found within the sclera. Scleral nanoparticles are capable of removing poisons from the sclera and are also capable of injecting antibodies into the sclera. Scleral nanoparticles are capable of sending and receiving an ultrasound signal to electronic devices of which is then used for electronic torture. The Scleral nanorobots, Scleral nanomachines, and Scleral nanocomputers are implanted into the three divisions of the sclera, which are the episclera, sclera proper, and lamina observes. World governments have secretly engineered highly advanced computer programs which are used to advance the process of nanoparticle transfection. These highly advanced programs allow electronic stalkers to implant nanodevices into the human anatomy at incredibly accurate precise anatomical locations. These programs are used by fascist to implant nanoparticles into our biology from any electronic device within society. Unfortunately, nanoscientists are not allowed to use these advanced techniques of nanoparticle transfection for medical purposes. This is due to the secret fascist agenda of all world governments. Our fascist government that rules the United Microwave Concentration States of America with an iron militaristic totalitarian fist will not allow nanoscience to be taught as it should be. This is due to the pathetic US military does not want society to develop into a greater state of scientific progress. Our totalitarian government will only give the pleasures and medical benefits of nanotechnology to the rich. The iris is composed of smooth muscle tissues that form a thin circular structure of the eye. The iris is located between the cornea and the lens. The iris controls the size of the pupil and protects the eye from absorbing an excessive amount of light. Nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that have been engineered to bind and control with the anatomy of the iris are capable of sending and receiving radio, microwave, and ultrasonic signals of which are used to communicate with an outside source. Iridological nanorobots, Iridological nanomachines, and Iridological nanocomputers can manipulate the interior anatomy of a cell with its nanocomponents, specifically the ""mainmanipulators, nanomanipulators, and nanogrippers."" Irigological nanoparticles can either repair or harm a cell of the iris. Iridological nanoparticles are capable of releasing toxins into the iris. Iridological nanoparticles are capable of injecting medicines into the iris. Iridological nanoparticles are equipped with nanosensors which can detect illnesses before they occur within the iris. Illnesses such as ""Granulomatous Rubeosis iridis, Aniridia, Lisch nodules, heterochromia iridis, iris melanoma, and hyphema.  Iridological nanoparticle acoustic sensors nanoparticles is used to send and receive radio, microwave, and ultrasonic signals to and from a medical team of nanoscientist, of which the data will be used to locate the Iridological nanoparticles that have been implanted into the iris. The medical team of nanoscientist will transmit electrical signals that will be used for medical treatment. The electrical signals allow the nanoscientist to control the movements of the Iridological nanoparticles, of which enables the nanoparticles to travel through the surface of the iris. The nano camera organic molecules will assist doctors in scanning and observe the interior structure of the iris. The organic pumps of the Iridological nanoparticles are used to release medicines into the iris of which will then eliminate diseases. Iridological nanoparticles that are used for medical procedures by professionals which obtained a degree in nanoscience can be used to save lives and prevent loss of vision. The above may occur at any point in time through the daily interaction with our electronic devices. This is due to the fascist secret agenda of torturing, brainwashing, and programming our citizens in the United States and also in many other countries around the world such as China and Russia. An electronic stalker can transmit digital sound wave signals from any electronic device of which is capable of programming the Iridological nanoparticles to control and change the color of the iris into any artificial color that of which is computerized. Iridological nanoparticles are also capable of increasing and or decreasing the size of the pupil through the interaction of digital sound waves that have been transmitted from any electronic device by an electronic stalker. At the center of the iris is a hole called the ""pupil."" The pupil allows light to interact with the retina. The pupil is black due to the tissues of the pupils absorb the light rays that are interacting with the eyeball. Nanoscientists have engineered nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that have been specifically designed to control the pupil of the eye. These nanoparticles have been engineered to transmit laser beams of which are used to negate radio and microwave signals. Nanocrystals of an Optical nanoparticle creates cavities within the nanoparticles, that of which is measurably capable to the wavelength of a photon. Transmitted electrical signals of photons travel through a narrow space formed by the Optical nanoparticle crystals in parallel lines. A tiny electric current must occur within the Optical nanoparticles, in order for the phenomenon of transmitting photons from the nanolasers of the Optical nanoparticles to occur. Pupil nanoparticles have been engineered by nanoscientist to treat diseases which affect the pupil of the eyeball. Diseases such as third cranial nerve palsy (CN III). Pupil nanoparticles are biologically capable of triggering billions of chemical reactions within the anatomy of the pupil, of which can regulate abnormally dilated pupils which have developed due to abnormal light absorption. Pupil nanoparticles that are used for medical purposes by nanoscientist are capable of attaching themselves onto the cells of the pupil and injecting drugs that will be used to correct genetic mutations. Microscopic drugs that are released by the Optical nanoparticles have been synthesized within laboratories that were funded by the government, however, only the elite of society are able to get such medical treatments. An electronic stalker can illegally program the nanoparticles that have been engineered to control the pupil of the eyeball by transmitting electromagnetic from any electronic device that of which can be found within society. The pupil nanorobots, pupil nanomachines, and pupil nanocomputers are capable of providing computer data to the pupil of the eyeball. All of which will manipulate the color of the pupil into different kinds of computerized colors and designs. This is possible due to the fact that the pupil nanoparticles are capable of propagating radio and or microwave frequencies that can be used to manipulate a person's eyesight and to cause visual disturbances. Through digital sound wave signals that are transmitted from any electronic device by an electronic stalker. The digital sound wave signals carry binary data of which are transmitted to the DNA fragments of the Iridological nanoparticles. The digital sound waves of radio frequencies will then cause a chain reaction of biophoton emissions that will dictate the size of the pupil by regulating the quantity of light that has entered the pupil.  Nano scientists have engineered nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that have been engineered to program and control the two types of humor of the eyeball. These nanoparticles are capable of maintaining the size and shape of the eyeball. The large space behind the lens is filled with a gel-like substance called the vitreous humor it helps to maintain the shape of the eye and its intraocular pressure. Nanoparticles that have been engineered to program and control the vitreous humor are capable of transmitting radio, microwave, and or ultrasonic signals that are used to communicate with an outside source either a medical team or an electronic torturing stalker. These nanoparticles of the vitreous humor are used to give either poisons and or drugs into the vitreous body. The vitreous nanoparticles are also capable of detecting illnesses. The aqueous humor is produced by cells covering the ciliary body. Nanoparticles that have been engineered to control the aqueous humor are capable of disturbing the liquid flow between the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber by releasing poisons. Nanoscientists have engineered several different forms of ciliary body muscle nanorobots, ciliary body muscle nanomachines, and ciliary body nanocomputers which are implanted into the different muscles of the ciliary body. The ciliary body nanoparticles are transmitted into the superior oblique, superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior rectus, lateral rectus, and inferior oblique. Grey goo nanoparticles that are transmitted into ciliary body muscles have the organic molecular structure to rejuvenate damaged tendons by self-replicating inside the cells of the tendons. The grey goo matter will genetically enhance the DNA molecules. Nanoparticles that are implanted into the ciliary body have the medical capabilities of repairing damaged nerve fibers. Electronic stalkers are capable under this fascist dictatorship to send digital sound wave signals from any electronic device into our eyes. The electrical signals can program the nanoparticles of the ciliary body muscles to dictate the movements of the human eye. The nanoparticles can cause the eyeball to change in shape. Most of the involuntary movements of the eyeball occur when thoughts are manipulated by digital sound waves transmitted into the brain and electrically stimulate the neural nanoparticles. There are many different kinds of optical nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers for each part of the eye of which there are specific optical nanoparticles that contain specific artificial DNA fragments, of which allows the nanodevices to record information like a camera. The nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers of the retina are all capable of recording, manipulating, and sending electrical signals to the brain through the optic nerve. There are inter white goo nanorobots and inter white goo nanomachines that have been engineered by neuroscientist to be implanted into the human brain by means of particle transfection. The white cell neural nanoparticles are capable of recording the electrical signals sent from the optical nanoparticles and are too capable of converting the electrical signals into radio, microwave, and or ultrasonic signals that of which will be acquired by radio, microwave, and or ultrasonic signals that  were transmitted from either from a medical team of nanoscientist or an electronic stalker. The electrical signals will then be transmitted to a laboratory, where a network of advanced computers will convert the binary data from electrical signals into video sequences and or images of which electronic stalkers can use the data to see what a person is seeing. The anatomy of the retina is composed of millions of photoreceptors that of which work together converting light energy into the electrical signals that are sent to our brains through the optic nerve. Nanoscientists have engineered extremely complex nanodevices that are designed to be implanted and bond with the anatomy of the retina. These nanodevices are as follows Retinal nanorobots, Retinal nanomachines, and Retinal nanocomputers. These Retinal nanoparticles have been engineered to be implanted within the layers of the retina which are the inner limiting membrane, nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell layer, Inner plexiform layer, inner nuclear layer, external nuclear layer, external limiting membrane, layers of rods, layers of cones, and the retinal pigment epithelium. The retinal nanorobots, retinal nanomachines, and the retinal nanocomputers have been engineered to bond with the sensory neural networks of the retina. Each retinal nanorobot, retinal nanomachine, and retinal nanocomputer have been engineered to bond with the photoreceptors, bipolar neurons, and ganglion neurons by either replacing a neuron, penetrating itself into a neuron, embedding itself onto a neuron, and bonding itself to the synapse networks of the retinal sensory neurons. Digital sound wave signals that are transmitted into the eyeball can stimulate the nanoparticles of the retina to disturb the flow of information through the synapse neural networks of the retina, which can cause blindness. The opposite can accur wherein the synapse neural networks may be stimulated to improve eyesight. Each Retinal nanodevice possesses highly complex sets of artificial nucleotide chemical compounds that act as a kind of microscopic camera that is capable of converting light energy into electrical impulses. The artificial nucleotides of the nano retinal cameras converts photons that have reflected off of objects into electrical impulses which will then be sent to the brain through the optical nerve. The nanoparticles of the cerebral cortex will then correlate the electrical impulses into radio signals, microwave signals, and or ultrasonic signals that will then be picked up by electromagnetic radiation that has been transmitted by an electronic stalker and will then be sent to the location of the electronic stalker. The electrical signals will be converted into images and video sequences through a network of computers. Lens nanoparticles also help the manipulation of the refraction of light to be focused on the retina. Molecular robot, machine, and computer cellular Theory  There are many different forms of nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, and smart dust nanoparticles that of which function differently according to both voluntary and involuntary anatomical control. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, and smart dust nanoparticles that have been engineered to be implanted into the human anatomy and attach themselves onto cells that of which the molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers are capable of injecting medicines and or toxins that may heal or kill the cells. A white goo nanoparticle ""the white cell"" is an artificial cell that is either a nanorobot or a nanomachine that can self-replicate and replace cells. A white goo nanoparticle can attach itself to a cell by using its nanomanipulators to penetrate through the cell membrane. The white cell nanoparticle connects itself to other cells, either artificial cells or natural cells with the white goo artificial synapse and artificial dendrite connectors. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, and smart dust nanoparticles that have been engineered to be implanted into the human anatomy in order to penetrate into cells, thus giving a grey goo fascist control of our internal cellular anatomy and too can it also allow a medical team of nanoscientists the opportunity to treat people that are suffering from diseases such as cancer.

There are nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that are capable of self-replicating throughout the interior and exterior of a cell. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that are capable of self-replicating throughout the blood vessels of the human anatomy. Nanoparticles all radiate billions of biophotons from their artificial computers of DNA fragments which trigger billions of chemical reactions per second. The biophoton emission of nanoparticles is used to activate its nanocomponents that will be used to manipulate cells and microscopic matter. This light production is also used to control cells. Top-down approach Top down approach refers to slicing or cutting of a bulk material to get nano sized material. This is similar to making a stone statue. You take a bulk piece of material and modify it by carving or cutting stone, until you have made the shape you want. The process involves material wastage and is limited by the resolution of the tools you can use, Cause significant crystallographic damage to the processed patterns. Examples : various types of lithographic techniques. Bottom-up approach Bottom up approach refers to the build up of a material from the bottom: atom by atom; molecule by molecule or cluster by cluster. This is equal to the same approach one would take to build a house: one takes lots of building blocks and puts them together to produce the final bigger structure. There is less wastage with this technique, and strong covalent bonds will hold the constituent parts together. A good example of this kind of approach is found in nature; all cells use enzymes to produce DNA by taking the component molecules and binding them together to make the final structure. Cells are the smallest living units of an organism, all cells share three common characteristics. These three characteristics are as follows; cells have a cell membrane which separates the inside of a cell from its anatomical environment, cytoplasm which is a jelly-like fluid composed of protoplasm, and DNA which is the cell's genetic material. There are many different kinds of molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers that are capable of finding their way within a cell through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm. These molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers are as follows nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles and smart dust nanoparticles. All of these forms of molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers interact with the organelles of a cell by attaching themselves onto an organelle and or penetrating into an organelle of a cell. Eukaryotic nanorobots, Eukaryotic nanomachines, Eukaryotic grey goo nanoparticles, Eukaryotic black goo nanoparticles, and Eukaryotic smart dust nanoparticles are molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers that are implanted within a Eukaryotic cell. Eukaryotic cells are more advanced cells found in plants and animals. Eukaryotic nanorobots that are implanted into a Eukaryotic cell can manipulate the genetic material of the cell and the molecular structures of its organelles. Eukaryotic nanorobots can do so by using their nano-components to manipulate the molecular structure of an organelle in order to form new chemical compounds. Eukaryotic nanorobots are equipped with nanomanipulators, nano grippers, nano-acoustic sensors, biomolecular nanosensors, nanoantennas, nanomagnets, nanomotors, and nano flagellum. Eukaryotic nanomachines are microscopic molecular machines that are capable of being implanted into a Eukaryotic cell, wherein DNA viruses will then be released into the cell and too can the Eukaryotic nanomachines produce protein synthesis. There are Eukaryotic nanomachines that use their helicase molecule as their main computer. The artificial helicase molecule can split DNA stands in two and move the DNA strands around using ATP. There are Eukaryotic nanomachines that use the enzyme molecule ""topoisomerase,"" these nanomachines are capable of unknotting DNA strands and rejoining them into sets of different sequences which cause hundreds of billions of chemical reactions. There are Eukaryotic nanomachines that use RNA nucleotide bonds to form nanocomponents such as nanomanipulators, nano grippers, nano-acoustic sensors, nanoantennas, and nanomagnets. There are Eukaryotic nanomachines that use many different strands of DNA molecules as nanocomputers which can emit biophotons of which triggers many specific chemical reactions that form different molecules of nano-components. Eukaryotic grey goo nanoparticles are either a kind of nanobot or a nanomachine that are capable of self-replicating and transforming molecules within cells into more Eukaryotic grey goo nanoparticles. Eukaryotic grey goo nanoparticles can multiply within a cell and transform the protoplasm of a cell into a grey goo substance of molecules that of which will transform the Eukaryotic cell into a grey goo cell. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can cause genetic superiority by eliminating genetic mutations that cause diseases. Eukaryotic black goo nanoparticles are made of an alien mineral oil substance that has been artificially turned into a nanobot and or a nanomachine. Black goo nanoparticles obtain their energy by causing genetic mutations that are extremely deadly to Eukaryotic cells. and Eukaryotic smart dust nanoparticles are molecular computers that are capable of attaching and penetrating itself within the Eukaryotic cell in order to sense and detect internal activities of cells. Nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that are implanted within a Eukaryotic cell are nearly identical in terms of what they are capable of achieving within our biology, however, the major difference is that the molecular structure of each molecular robot, molecular machine, and or molecular computer differs from each other and the amount of information that each specific nanoparticle can correlate also differs from one another. Molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers will manipulate the genetic material of the cell and the molecular structures of the organelles within a cell by radiating biophotons that produce different colors of lights, that of which have emerged due to an outside interfering pulse modulated radio and or microwave signal that have provided binary information to the cellular molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers. Ultrasound is also used to convey data to a cellular smart dust nanoparticle. The prokaryotic nanorobots, prokaryotic nanomachines, and prokaryotic nanocomputers have been developed in order to control unicellular organisms. The variety of prokaryotic nanoparticles are quite limited due to the fact that unicellular organisms are not of a major scientific importance to the grey goo fascist that are in power, it is our human anatomy that is of an importance to fascist. However, according to the grey goo scenario, all matter on earth will be transformed into grey goo nanoparticles. Therefore in the near future grey goo fascist will expand scientifically in terms of prokaryotic nanotechnology, in order to control the entire world. It is our duty as grey goo freedom fighters to develop and pass laws that will protect our freedoms from grey goo oppression and give us greater powers of grey goo medical benefits. We as people that believe in grey goo freedom must stand together and fight for higher forms of grey goo education for the public that will expand grey goo nanotechnology throughout the world in order to meet the grey goo scenario without losing our freedoms. Under this fascist regime of the United States government, grey goo nanoscience is a taboo and if taught is punishable by death. This is because the upper class of society which are fascist desire to control the lower average people with grey goo nanoparticles. grey goo nanoparticles can transform people into super humans that possess superior intelligence, superior strength, and superior beauty. The same technology can be used to control the minds and bodies of people and too can grey goo nanoparticles be used to cause genetic inferiority. The control center of the cell, the nucleus contains DNA or genetic material. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can manipulate the genetic material of a DNA molecule, however, Eukaryotic nanoparticles can only do so in different ways through different limitations. Eukaryotic nanoparticles found within the nuclear membrane can cause chemical reactions that will force the Chromatin ( which is the tangled spread out form of DNA found inside the nuclear membrane) these artificial chemical reactions will force a  cell to divide. The DNA then is forced to condense into structures known as chromosomes. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can trigger chemical reactions within the nucleus in order to form and produce ribosomes. This then leads to protein synthesis outside of the nucleus. The ribosomes and the rest of the organelles float around inside the cytoplasm. Ribosomes that are created through the chemical reactions of the Eukaryotic nanoparticles are then attached to the endoplasmic Reticulum ""ER."" There are two types of ER, which are rough endoplasmic reticulum which has ribosomes attached to it. The second is smooth ER of which does not have ribosomes attached to it. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can also attach themselves onto an ER. The endoplasmic reticulum is a membrane encoded passageway for transporting materials such as the proteins synthesized by ribosomes. Proteins emerge from the endoplasmic reticulum and in small vesicles where the Golgi apparatus receives them. The Eukaryotic nanoparticles can trigger the release of the small vesicles to the Golgi apparatus.  The mitochondrion is an organelle that is the nuclear power plant of both animal and plant cells. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can attach themselves onto the mitochondria and can also penetrate into the interior anatomy of the mitochondria. The Eukaryotic nanoparticles are capable of manipulating DNA found within the mitochondria. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can force cellular respiration to take place. Cellular respiration is the process of which the Mitochondria makes ATP molecules that provide energy for all the cell's activities. Cells that need more energy need more mitochondria. The nanorobots are built upon a single strand of DNA which is combined with short synthetic strands of DNA designed by the experts. When mixed together, they self-assemble into a desired shape.                                                                        Nano Manipulator grippers Manipulator grippers are able to grasp and hold micro and nano size objects.                                                                              Nano micromanipulator A micromanipulator is a device which is used to physically interact with a sample under a microscope, where a level of precision of movement is necessary that cannot be achieved by the unaided human hand. It may typically consist of an input joystick, a mechanism for reducing the range of movement and an output section with the means of holding a micro tool to hold, inject, cut or otherwise manipulate the object as required. The mechanism for reducing the movement usually requires the movement to be free of backlash. This is achieved by the use of kinematic constraints to allow each part of the mechanism to move only in one or more chosen degrees of freedom, which achieves a high precision and repeating of movements, usually at the expense of some absolute accuracy.                       Nano Manipulator  The nano Manipulator system consists of an optical scanning device, a computer interface and a physical manipulator. The scanning device, known as a scanned-probe microscope (SPM), can magnify images up to approximately 1,000,000 times. The computer interface provides a large, 3-D visual display and produces the effect of telepresence, giving users the impression that they are observing an enlarged replica of the object. The manipulator provides variable force and motion control, including tactile sensors and feedback devices that provide a ""feel"" for the object under examination. Sessions with the nano Manipulator can be shared among multiple users at diverse locations. The nano Manipulator has widespread applications in the physical and biological sciences. The device has been used to evaluate the characteristics of carbon nanotubes, polymers, living cells, disease pathogens, metal particles and microchips.                                 Main Nano Manipulator  Nano manipulation could be defined as the manipulation of nano meter sized objects with a nano meter size end effector with sub nano meter precision. By manipulation it is meant that nano  objects are pushed or pulled, cut, pick, and place, positioned, oriented, assembled, indented, bent, twisted, ect.  By controlling external forces with sensory feedback. Grouping nano manipulation systems can be conducted based on the usual starting point manipulator and object interaction process, utilized nano manipulators interaction and operation techniques. For applying an external force down on manipulators can be designed as a contact or non-contact type. Atomic Force microscopy AFM and scanning tunneling microscope STM probes are the most widely used metal manipulators using an STM probe. Manipulation of atoms or molecules by applying voltage pulse is between the probe. Grouping of mental manipulation systems depending on starting point utilizes process manipulators and objects interaction type and utilizes operation technique.                                    Nanosensors Nanosensors can detect various chemicals in gases for pollution monitoring. For medical diagnostic purposes either as blood borne sensors or in lab-on-a-chip type devices. To monitor physical parameters such as temperature, displacement and flow As accelerometers in MEMS devices like airbag sensors. When a molecule of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is present it will strip an electron from the nanotube, which in turn causes the nanotube to be less conductive. If ammonia (NO3) is present it reacts with water vapour and donates an electron to the carbon nanotube, making it more conductive. By treating the nanotubes with various coating materials, they can be made sensitive to certain molecules and immune to others. Nanosensors can detect single cells or even atoms, making them far more sensitive than counterparts with larger components.                    Nano acoustic sensor  Nano acoustic sensor attached to an on board computer, sends and receives ultrasonic signals to communicate with medical team.  A nano acoustic sensor can measure sound levels. They are called acoustic wave sensors because their detection mechanism is a mechanical (or acoustic) wave.                                Nano environmental sensors Nano environmental sensors detect environmental changes based upon sensing the external and internal environments of an organism, and for inducing muscle movement. Nano environmental sensors can monitor changes of touch, balance, taste, smell, hearing, and vision. Nano environmental sensors have been designed to receive information from the environment. Nano environmental sensors respond to stimuli through electrochemical communication.                   Nano dipole antenna  An optical nano dipole antenna is analyzed by means of its input impedance as well as the matching properties of the antenna topology and material configuration. A comparison of this classical microwave driving method with plane wave excitation is accomplished, contrasting the resonances in the input impedance and optical cross sections for several setups, and analyzing the spectral response shape. It is found that for all structures analyzed, a simple linear expression can be defined characterizing the relation between total dipole length and resonant wavelength. The fact that this linear relationship remains valid for different excitation models, for most widely used antenna materials (Au, Ag, Cu, and Al) and even in the presence of substrates is important with respect to practical designs. To our knowledge, such an extensive study has not been performed before. Nano-antennas are the optical equivalent of antennas that are used to transmit and receive information at radio frequencies. These antennas have been used in different applications in photonics such as optical imaging, particle manipulation, bio-sensing, and improvement of the performance of solar cells. In this article we study composite nano-antennas made of alternating layers of silica and gold.                                                                                    link-up connector  All nanorobots will have a link-up connector to use power resources from bigger nanobots.  This helps the nanorobots perform more complicated tasks. The larger nanorobot is then linked to the smaller nanorobots and as a result provides electrical data to the smaller nanorobots that will be used to instruct the smaller nanorobots to do a specific job. The larger nanorobot remain in full control of the smaller nanobots.                                                           locomotion flagella  locomotion flagella is a slender threadlike structure, especially a microscopic whiplike nanometer scale appendage that enables nanorobots to swim. The locomotion flagella allows nanorobots to travel through the circulatory system, maneuvering  through the blood vessels and avoiding blood cells if required.   Flagellar pneumatic connectors  Flagellar pneumatic connectors enable the nanorobots to connect to cells and walk around in our cells. Flagellar pneumatic connectors also allow nanorobots to extract chemicals as a means of generating energy.                    Nanomanpulator site  Nanomanipulator site is molecular compound site where the nanomanipulators connect to and receive information on how the nanomanipulators will function.     The white cell is a nanorobot that is an artificial cell that has been created to bond with and or replace existing cells. The white cell is known as the white goo, which is a self-replicating nanobot that can travel through the circulatory system, killing pathogens and cells. The white cell contains many nano manipulator systems, which consists of optical scanning devices, artificial DNA substances that serves as a computer interface, and a physical manipulator which is capable of penetrating the cell membrane in order to manipulate the internal anatomy of the cell, this is of extreme medical importance, due to the fact that the nano manipulators of a white cell nanorobot can use it's manipulators to revive injured cells and or manipulate harmful protoplasm mutations. A white cell consists of many manipulator grippers that are able to grasp and hold micro and nano size objects. The white cell manipulator grippers are also used to attach itself onto a cell body. The white cell contains many nano acoustic sensors of which each are attached to it's own artificial DNA molecule which acts as an on board computer. The white cell acoustic sensors sends and receives radio signals, microwave signals, and ultrasonic signals to communicate with a medical team. The white cell possesses nano-antennas which are used as an optical equivalent of antennas, of which are used to transmit and receive information at radio frequencies.  White cell nanorobots possess link-up connector that are used to link other smaller white cell nanobots together into a common power resource that is provided from the largest white cell nanobot. The White cell has a nanomagnet built into it that allows nanoscientist to control its movements. The white cell contains nanosynapses and nanodendrites. White cells are equipped with multiple biological sensors which detects chemicals and reactions within it's anatomical environment. These nanorobots can self-replicate by dividing into multiple white cells that may vary in size and transform into different cells that of which originate in a specific organ. White cell nanorobots can be used to treat and or cure amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The white cell nanobot consist of many nano computers that radiates hundreds of billions of biophotons per second, as a result the white cell (white goo) illuminates a white shine. There are three types of white cells, the first is the sensory white cell which gets information about what's going on inside and outside of the body and brings that information into the central nervous system in order for it to be processed, the second is the motor white cell, which receives electrochemical impulses from other motor white cells and other cells and as a result conveys commands to the muscles, organs and glands, the third is the Inter white cells which are found only in the central nervous system, the inter white cell connects each cell to one another. The inter white cell receives electrical stimuli from other cells and or white cells, such as sensory neurons, sensory white cells, inter neurons, and or inter white cells, and send electrochemical impulses to other cells and or white cells, such as motor neurons, motor white cells, inter neurons, and or inter white cells. White cell nanorobots operate within our anatomy through digital sound wave signals that may be transmitted from a medical team of nano scientist and or a fascist electron stalker. The White cell (white goo) can cure many diseases and save the lives of billions of people around the world, however at the same time it may also be used to harm and kill billions of people around the world. Barack Hussein Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Michelle Obama have tortured me by implanting highly detailed life-like computerized images of themselves by means of transmitting a quantum electrical signal that of which interacts with the optical nanobots that are implanted into my eyes!  The actions of the computerized images of Obama are as follows, giant hologram images of Obama's head attacking me from the sky, Obama stabbing me while I walk, Obama spitting into my face, Obama spitting into my ear, Obama spitting into my food and drinks, Obama manipulating my dreams, Obama raping me in my own head, Obama implanting computerized dreams of him raping me, Obama licking my ear, Obama sucking my penis, Obama licking and sucking my anus, images of Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Michelle Obama opening their mouths and as they do so, they then stimulate a crackling sensation in my ears, Obama possessing my body while I pray, Obama open mouth kissing me, Obama murdering my family and crucifying them onto a wall, Obama attacking and raping my siblings, of which are children, Obama appearing in all of my past memories, and Obama forcing me to obey him in my dreams! Hillary Clinton is torturing me by implanted thoughts of her screaming ""war"" in my head, Hillary Clinton appearing as a demon creature, Hillary Clinton has implanted poisonous nano chips in my brain, Hillary Clinton releasing crackling sounds from my abdomen, and Hillary Clinton manipulating my dreams in order to torture me as I sleep! Joe Biden is torturing me by implanting thoughts into my brain of him stabbing me, raping me, spitting at me, shooting at me, punching me, implanting his name into my brain for over 350 thousand times in the past 16-17 months and continuing to do so everyday of my life that of which causes me to experience severe twitching! As a result of the implanted artificial thoughts of the name ""Joe Biden,"" I could see his name and image wherever I would look, for example; I would see his name in the sky, the moon, in the clouds, my eyes, and forehead as I would look in a mirror! The following is how Michelle Obama is torturing me, Michelle Obama possesses my body daily, Michelle Obama implants thoughts into my brain of her stabbing me, hitting me, manipulating my face by enlarging lips, forcing me to act like a woman, Michelle Obama tortures me while I am asleep by implanting computerized nightmares in my brain, and Michelle Obama implanted a computerized dream in my brain of her raping me! All of this punishment in the form of mind control torture has been brought upon me because I made a short video explaining that Obama is not African American, because his father is from East Africa ""Kenya,"" not West Africa, and that Obama is not genetically related to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr! Governments are programming and torturing people with nanotechnology. While living in California, where I was tortured the most by Obama, I was gasping for air begging Obama to stop implanting the name ""Joe Biden"" into my brain. Obama's response via a telepathic electrical signal was ""no, I killed 700 Muslims do you know what I can do to you?"" Obama then sent an electrical signal into my brain wherein I saw and felt him open mouth kissing me. The 700 Muslims that Obama was referring to were the 717 Muslims that died on September 26, 2015, in a stampede during hajj. Obama and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia sabotaged the stampede in order to manipulate the economies of the countries that represented the pilgrims of those that attended Hajj during September 26, 2015! Obama, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev the world's greatest fascist have illegally implanted millions of Nanobots into the brains and bodies of innocent people including both Americans, Russians, Europeans, Asians, Australians, and Africans! Barack Hussein Obama has secretly traded nanobot technology information with the Russian Federation under the leadership of Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev! While living in California where I was tortured the most, Barack Hussein Obama gave permission to his secret agents to purchase highly lethal poisonous nanobot technology from the Russians of which Barack Hussein Obama's secret agents used the technology against me in order to poison my brain! I as a result from the poisonous nanobot brain implants have developed severe pain in the form of bumps on the lower left side of my head!   Vladimir Putin has used nanobot technology to implement physical restraint without an outside physical force against me while I protested on ""Facebook"" against him and the fascist dictator Obama! Barack Hussein Obama has given permission to Vladimir Putin and his KGB spies to torture me while I slept by waking me and forcing me to suffer from sleep deprivation! Barack Hussein Obama, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev have threatened to kill me by implanting highly poisonous Nanobots into my anatomy! The fascist dictators ""Barack Hussein Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev have not shown any remorse for  the victims of electronic mind control! Therefore I do conclude that it is of the best interest of the common person to rebel  against all fascist rule in the world!  Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev have illegally tested electromagnetic radiation wave attacks against their own people! Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev are manipulating the minds of millions of innocent Russians and torturing innocent people night and day over acts of freedom! Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev along with their military advisors are using  nanotechnology to manipulate the Russian economy! The Russian military is torturing innocent people from Ukraine by controlling the minds and bodies of the Ukrainians through nanobot technology! The victims of mind control torture in Ukraine are suffering from nanobot mind control rape! Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev are sabotaging the entire process of obtaining Liberty and freedom around the world! Barack Hussein Obama, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev are equal in terms of dictating people and all share similar forms of political movements in terms of governing and ruling a nation? Therefore I conclude that the world's most powerful leaders are mind controlling dictators that adore fascism as much as Hitler did while he was alive. Barack Hussein Obama, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Donald Trump, the fascist Democrats, and the fascist Republicans must stand trial for the expansion of nanobot brain implantation and microscopic electrode brain implantation in the United States and also in many foreign countries!   Barack Hussein Obama, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and every last fascist democrat must stand trial for the illegal implantation of nanochips into the human brain and body! In the following are detailed technological mind controlling nanobot capabilities that Barack Hussein Obama is using against innocent Americans such as myself 'Wael Ghafarji,"" in order to telepathically torture people that disagree with him!   The constant microwave attacks from all angles have completely destroyed me as an individual the constant fear that I may commit suicide to escape the pain and misery of my life. My overwhelming tears when I sit with my loved ones of which are children and the constant fear that they too may be targeted by the fascists grey goo government that is in power. Being the only individual in the entire country that can see all the microwave weapons that of which have been disguised as electronic devices and have been implemented within society for the sole purpose of Mind Control is the most terrifying and shocking realization of reality. I now understand that we do not live in the United States of America but rather the United Grey Goo Fascist Microwave Concentration States of America. I'm tired of cutting myself, I'm tired of losing my reality, and I wish that the pain of mind control torture would stop. I was informed through RF hearing effect that powerful satellites transmitted rapid frames of advance radio signals back in time when I was a child.   The super quantum satellites orbiting our planet can send electrical signals back in time to a specific location that of which will interact with the nanobots of the brain of a person and or people that lived during the 1980s, 1990s, and up until the twenty-first century. However, there is a possibility that the satellites can release highly powerful electromagnetic radiation waves that can manipulate the thoughts of a person or people that do not yet have nanobots implanted into their brains before the 1980s! Nanobots have been a worldwide government project for the past eighty years! It is only recently of the year 1970 to the year 1980 that world governments began to implant nanobots into our brains! Nanobots have greatly advanced since the 1980s and the methods of implanting nanobots into our anatomy have also significantly advanced! I as a child was visited by two powerful nanobot cyborgs from the future! I was tortured and experimented on while I was asleep! I had many computerized nightmares! Before being visited by the nanobot cyborgs, my family and I went to California to visit my dying grandfather. The night that my family and I returned from California to New York, was when my life changed forever. I later that night was visited by the first nanobot cyborg, which appeared to me outside my window at the age of nine. It appeared after I heard a loud sound that seemed like an energy disturbance that came from the back of my house. It stood by the wall of my old garage, where there was absolutely no electronic devices. The nanobot cyborg appeared as a hunched over eight foot tall alien with large black eyes. The nanobot cyborg was pointing down. The nanobot cyborg wanted me to leave my bed and walk to it. The nanobot cyborg was sent from the future by people that wanted to protect me from the future attacks that I was going to suffer from, for my entire childhood, teenage youth, and adulthood.  Before appearing outside my window it communicated to me telepathically, saying ""if I look outside my window, will I see Bigfoot?"" Once I saw what was outside my window at the age of nine, I paid close attention to its physical details. After seeing the nanobot cyborg, I became quite afraid and hurried to my brother's bed on the other side of the room.  I looked out my window again and saw the same nanobot cyborg stretching over in front of my window with its arms propelled outwards. However, it no longer had eyes. The Radiation of the nanobot cyborg would have possessed me if I had I walked to that spot where it was pointing, I would have had advance nanoparticles transmitted into my anatomy. The nanoparticles would have protected me from all forms of microwave attacks and radio frequency attacks. The nanobot cyborg which was programmed to look like an alien saved my life and the lives of my family members. The of the nanobot cyborg that appeared as an alien to me at the age of nine was composed of time traveling future nanocomputers. The second nanobot cyborg that I saw, was about a week or two later. It appeared at the side of my sister's bed in my little sister's room, where I was sleeping. It woke me up and said, ""hey Wally, did you see the wolfman?"" A few days earlier I saw a documentary of werewolves. This second nanobot cyborg was short, green, and had many black holes throughout its body. It's telepathic voice sounded like a fully grown German man. This is known as project Bigfoot, aka the wolfman. Those that were watching me from the future knew what I was watching. The wolfman, I believe was the first nanobot cyborg ""the alien.""  I was a targeted individual for my entire life. I was programmed for my entire life. During the day as a child, while I was awake I had many torturing artificial thoughts that were implanted into my brain. One artificial thought at the age of seven was a pale man that was wearing a black suit, I asked him what is your name, and he then replied ""God."" I was tortured by this man for 7 to 9 days. Even until this day he hasn't left me. It seems though from my deliberate attempts of protesting against nanobot electromagnetic torture on Facebook, twitter, YouTube, and my websites, I have angered people from the future. Those that I have angered  used time traveling technology to alter my past, so that I would not be able to expose the nanobot mind controlling corruption of all world governments! In the house that I was living in, where I saw the first two nanobot cyborgs from the future, I noticed that while I was watching television that there were three grown men staring at me and listening to me from the television. This would mean that all the TVs in the house were being monitored and that microwave attacks were being transmitted from the televisions. I was followed since I was 7 and up until this very day. The United States has been attacking me since I was a child, I have been at war with this fascist Morgellons disease government since I was born. The sound of the energy like disturbance that I heard before seeing the first nanobot cyborg outside from my window can be used to attack people. Our televisions and electronics can transmit radiation waves that can either cure or cause mental illnesses. The sound of the energy like disturbance is a type of powerful portal that can release that can alter reality. These portals can emerge without making a sound.  My family and I were under attack from the future and the US government used time traveling portals to torture us. The first nanobot cyborg that I saw was proof that such portals were being used against me and my family. The fact that I was able to hear and see something from the future was a sign of help and that a time traveling war was and is taking place. The first nanobot cyborg that I saw when I was nine is still in my life and I see it every day, I see the great alien in the mountains, the trees, the sky, the moon, the ground, in flowers, in food, in drinks, in mirrors, in the faces of my family members, I see the great nanobot cyborg in paintings, the floor, in clothes, in water, I see the great alien in my dreams, and I see the great alien in my fingers. The great alien that I saw when I was a child is taking the pain away, I just wish that I left my room that night and walked to the great alien. The closer I am to the nanobot cyborg, the safer I am. In my real reality, the US government murdered my family with microwave attacks and the US government decided to use the time traveling technology to target me as a child so that I wouldn't be as successful in exposing nanotechnology and the advancements of electromagnetism. The great alien was my guardian angel. It watched me from the trees, the sky, the moon, my food, the walls, the floor, paintings, clouds, the stars, in my clothes, my video games, my electronics, in my childhood cartoons that I watched, my fingers, my hands, and my eyes. It protecting me in the dark as a child but as much as they did to save me, I still suffered horribly.  Those that sent the nanobot cyborg back in time when I was a child are protecting me from microwave attacks and radio frequency attacks.   My protection from electronic torture increases as is I think of that day when I was nine and I first saw that great nanobot alien cyborg outside my window. To those that went back in time and saved my life by preventing many of the future attacks against me. I greatly am thankful and I do owe my life to those brave men and women. Thank you all for protecting my family and I from electronic nanobot mind control torture and I greatly am thankful to those incredible people that went back in time to save my life. I have learned to resist the microwave and radio frequency attacks by meditating on that night when I saw the alien nanobot cyborg. I for the past two years have been brainwashed by Donald Trump and those that work for him to post many comments on electronic harassment and nanobot mind control on the youtube videos, facebook accounts, and twitter accounts of Obama, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and anyone that Donald Trump disliked. If I didn't post comments the torture would worsen, it reached the point where it didn't matter if I posted comments or not. I would still be under horrible electronic torture by the US military. Donald Trump forced me through microwave auditory hearing effect and radio frequency hearing effect that I must, no matter what, if I wanted to breath that I had no choice but to post comments all day. What made things worse is that Obama and Donald Trump were both torturing me. I spent nearly 12 to 15 hours a day posting comments on nanotechnology and electronic torture. I was not allowed to post any comments about the medical benefits of nanotechnology. I was starving because I spent all of my money to pay my phone bill in advance for the internet connection while being tortured. I was very poor and homeless, Donald Trump used me for cyber warfare and in the end, he was going to kill me and my family with the most powerful forms of pure mind control microwave torture. Those that sent the nanobot cyborg back in time when I was nine years old are now at war with Obama, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Joe Biden, the democrats, and the republicans. I no longer have to post comments on youtube, facebook, and twitter to breath. I just need to meditate on that night all day and I will not be tortured. I am being protected by those great people that send the nanobot cyborgs back in time seventeen years ago. The computerized nightmares have ended, the electrical signals that cause computerized thoughts and brain damage are being blocked, I am no longer seeing any visual computerized hallucinations, however I do see many aliens around me.  When I close my eyes and meditate, I begin to see green energy in my thoughts and as I continue to meditate the green energy turns into aliens. The green energy that I am seeing in my thoughts are being used to heal the parts of my brain that have been under attack by electrical signals. The green energy that I am thinking of as I meditate is coming from radio and microwave signals that are being transmitted from outer space and from the future. I am receiving radio signals from the future. Most of the attacks against me from the US military are being blocked by satellites in outer space. When I look into a mirror in a dark room, I see my eyes transforming into alien eyes and I see behind me the same alien nanobot cyborg stretching with its arms propelled outwards. If only he protected me, if only Donald Trump wasn't a lying mind controlling fascist electronic stalker, if only the US military believed in freedom, if only our government wasn't a fascist grey goo dictatorship. I of my choice will post comments of nanotechnology and the advancements of electromagnetism on the youtube videos, facebook channels, and the twitter accounts of Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Barack Hussein Obama, Joe Biden, and the next vice president for the next 8 years of Donald Trump's presidency. Under the authority of those that have the powers of time travel, all nations must declare economic warfare against the United States. I am not an American.  Please visit my websites www.nanobotbrainimplant.com www.nanobotmindcontroltorture.com www.obamabraininitiative.org www.obamabraininitiatives.org www.nanobotmindcontrol.com",8년 전,2,

@waelghafarji9376,"The fascist democrats, the fascist republicans, the fascist US military, and the state of California are killing me! Obama has implanted nano chips and microscopic electrodes into every American brain! A nano chip and a microscopic electrode are molecules that can penetrate any form of matter, due to their energy vibrations of which forms space! Nanorobotics is the technology of creating machines or robots at or close to the microscopic scale of a nanometer (10−9 meters). Advanced nanobots will be able to sense and adapt to environmental stimuli such as heat, light, sounds, surface textures, and chemicals; perform complex calculations; move, communicate, and work together; conduct molecular assembly; and, to some extent, repair or even replicate themselves. Nanotechnology is the science and application of creating objects on a level smaller than 100 nanometers.  The concept of nanotechnology is the ""bottom up"" creation of virtually any material or object by assembling one atom at a time. Nanomanufacturing is the creation of materials and products through: (1) Direct Molecular Assembly (DMA) -- discrete, directed assembly of individual atoms and molecules into macroscale materials and products; (2) Indirect Crystalline Assembly (ICA) -- creation of conditions that foster the growth of nanoscale crystals that are then combined into macroscale materials and products; or (3) Massive Parallelism Assembly (MPA) -- the creation of many nanomachines or nanobots whose operating parameters cause them to work synergistically to assemble atoms and molecules into macroscale materials and products. An autonomous DNA nanorobot is capable of transporting molecular payloads to cells, sensing cell surface inputs for conditional, triggered activation, and reconfiguring its structure for payload delivery. The device can be loaded with a variety of materials in a highly organized fashion and is controlled by an aptamer-encoded logic gate, enabling it to respond to a wide array of cues. Nanotechnology, or, as it is sometimes called, molecular manufacturing , is a branch of engineering that deals with the design and manufacture of extremely small electronic circuits and mechanical devices built at the molecular level of matter. A chronic electrode implant is an electronic device implanted chronically (for a long period) into the brain or other electrically excitable tissue. It may record electrical impulses in the brain or may stimulate neurons with electrical impulses from an external source. Symptoms of Nanobot mind control are as follows, Microwave hearing, transmission of specific commands into the subconscious. Visual disturbances, visual hallucinations, Inject words, numbers into brain via electromagnetic radiation waves, Manipulation of emotions, reading thoughts remotely, causing pain to any nerve of the body, remote manipulation of human behavior from space, harassment, the control of one's breathing, Control of sleep patterns, computer-brain interface, Complex control of the brain such as retrieving memories, implanting personalities, vomiting, severe twitching of the head, physical restraint without an outside physical force, manipulation of one's thought and eyesight in order to force an individual to attack his or her own self, the loss of control of one's own bodily movements, the manipulation of thought of which demonic programs are implanted into an individual's brain,  psychological manipulation through implanted thoughts to force a person to perform actions that are not typical such as, cursing, screaming, hitting a love one, murdering a loved one, eating abnormally, behaving improperly, possessing abnormal sexual behaviors and fetishes, the stimulation of one's own body part in order to insight a feeling of touch along with an implanted sexual thought in order to cause discomfort, the inability of imagining, and the inability of thinking of past events without having a stranger involved in the memory!   Electronic harassment/electronic torture/electronic murder is about harassment, torture and murder using electronic weapons based on radio waves. These weapons have been very refined last years and can cause effects comparable to many illnesses and/or injuries. These weapons are not science-fiction but used today illegally by your national secret services on mostly random innocent victims not knowing what is being done to them. Frequency waves that can access a person’s nervous system, brain and body to affect their sight, vision, physical coordination, have been developed leaving people all over the world to suffer cruel torture, to be labeled ""mentally ill"", and to ultimately die an early and horrible death. Computers are reading my brain frequencies and depending on which frequency my brain just is, pain is triggered and organs are manipulated in varying intensity. The physical torture is used for mind control which should lead to the extinction of my personality as well as the destruction of my mental-cognitive and organic forces.  All pain and organ manipulation can be generated in various intensities of light to medium to strong, occur from second to second, and then stop. It can affect several organs simultaneously. Blurred vision, extremely strong burning sensation, eye muscle contractions (feeling of tearing and crushing of the eyeballs), and stitches in the eye. Seeing blue and white flashes daily. The generating extreme difficulty of breathing: 1. By tightening the abdominal muscles, narrowing of the bronchi and trachea - exhalation flows only shortened by itself, must exhale stepped up - just the same with inhalation - both techniques are applied simultaneously since July 2012, almost non-stop, 18 hours a day. In addition, severe pain in the stomach area are generated, presumably, the solar plexus is cramped. 2. Generating a sense of suffocation in the head. 3. Narrowing of the vaginal walls nose - nasal breathing is considerably more difficult. Electronic Rape: Manipulation of the anal, vaginal and clitoral nerves. Frequencies were also induced by sexual desire since the beginning of 2014. The amount of sexual manipulation due to radio frequencies can increase instantly. The more I resist, the more I get manipulated with subliminal messages that I wanted to do it, that it was absolutely my own decision.  The psychopaths want to make me do all the things they want and if it fails, it will simply be induced more intense - this is constant and the physical pain in my sexual organs is unbearable. My electronic sexual torture is as follows, abnormal electrical sensations in the tongue, crackling sensations in the throat, crackling sensations in the ears, anal sensations stimulated by electricity, electrical sensations in the fingers, irritation in the chest, uncontrollable sexual computerized thoughts, the inability of controlling one's body movements, abnormal breathing patterns, inability to urinate, and groaning noises, abnormal disturbing electrical sensations in my lips, abnormal heart beat, and a disturbing sensation that I need to vomit. The electronic stalkers also have control of my five senses with electromagnetic radiation. It is known as the brain-computer interface, BCI, FULLY INTEGRATED into the human body. There are many implants. nanoscale. The use of polymer, carbon-based diamond nanowire integrates the system. In nanoscale, it is one-billionth of a meter. The program is global, many countries many victims.  IT IS A GLOBAL NETWORK OF ORGANIZED CRIME. Funded by governments, labor unions, law enforcement, military, corporations, and companies. DARPA is perhaps one of the largest criminal companies. Under the synthetic telepathy program, synthetic soldier program. Using biotelemetry, and ground operatives, and the use of wireless dial-up technology. If you are hearing these criminals, you have been implanted. Cochlear implants, sems, which act like speakers in your auditory center of the brain. The neural chip has been inserted through the nose and is now in the frontal lobe of the brain. Yes, there are robotic implants that move throughout the body, either by remote signal or carried through the blood and airways. DARPA, the U.S. Department of Defense research arm, has announced $14.9 billion in funding for major research institutions to collaborate on brain implants that can help repair traumatic brain injury and control the brain. My perpetrators are members of organized crime, the dept of justice, FBI, DHS, CIA, counter-terrorism task force members, local cops, multi-jurisdictional task force members, Union members, university students, gangs etc. the list goes on and on. There are many that are involved. My computerized dreams are created by a projector, the criminals are physically very close to me. The experience of synthetic telepathy “Artificial Telepathy” is really not that extraordinary. It’s as simple as receiving a cell-phone call in one’s head. Indeed, most of the technology involved is identical to that of cell-phone technology. Satellites link the sender and the receiver. A computer “multiplexer” routes the voice signal of the sender through microwave towers to a very specifically defined location or cell. The “receiver” is located and tracked with pinpoint accuracy, to within a few feet of actual location. But the receiver is not a cell phone. It’s a human brain.  Biocomputers utilize systems of biologically derived molecules, such as DNA and proteins, to perform computational calculations involving storing, retrieving, and processing data. Nanobiotechnology can be defined as any type of technology that utilizes both nano-scale materials, i.e. materials having characteristic dimensions of 1-100 nanometers, as well as biologically based materials (34).4 A more restrictive definition views nanobiotechnology more specifically as the design and engineering of proteins that can then be assembled into larger, functional structures (116-117) (9).³,1 The implementation of nanobiotechnology, as defined in this narrower sense, provides scientists with the ability to engineer biomolecular systems specifically so that they interact in a fashion that can ultimately result in the computational functionality of a computer.  Mind uploading or whole brain emulation (sometimes called mind transfer) is the hypothetical process of scanning and mapping a biological brain in detail and copying its state into a computer system or another computational device. The computer would have to run a simulation model so faithful to the original that it would behave in essentially the same way as the original brain, or for all practical purposes, indistinguishable. The simulated mind is assumed to be part of a virtual reality simulated world, supported by a simplified body simulation model. Alternatively, the simulated mind could be assumed to reside in a computer inside (or connected to) a humanoid robot or a biological body, replacing its brain. LEUVEN, Belgium — IMEC has created a novel brain implant chip that uses CMOS to provide a Lego-like platform for plugging in arrays of tiny devices each sporting hundreds of contacts. The European research group also is developing a handful of techniques to interface electronics with the body, some of them working at the level of individual cells.  Nano-fibers specifically are a transport mechanism. Nothing more. They hold a payload for delivery. A payload that would otherwise be compromised by the sun or atmosphere or not make it to its destination (your body). Such as a virus, RNA, aluminum, nano-components, etc. The fibers are (surprisingly) quite harmless as everyone has them. Examples of these fibers can be found all over the internet or in the physical examples section of this site. The fibers must be independently sprayed, if they were added to the jet fuel the extreme heat would destroy the payload. RNM works remotely to control the brain in order to read and detect any criminal thought taking place inside the mind of a possible perpetrator. Research studies have shown that the human brain thinks at a rate of about 5000 bits per second and does not have the capacity to compete with supercomputers performing via satellites, implants, and biotelemetry. The human brain has a distinctive set of bioelectric resonance system. For the RNM system, supercomputers are being used and, thus, with its help, supercomputers can send messages through an implanted person’s nervous system in order to influence their performance in the desired way. RNM has been developed after about 50 years of neuro-electromagnetic involuntary human experimentations. According to many scientists, within a few years, it is expected that DNA microchips will be implanted in the human brain which would make it inherently controllable.  With RNM, it will be possible to read and control a person’s emotional thought processes along with the subconscious and dreams. At present, around the world, supercomputers are monitoring millions of people simultaneously with the speed of 20 billion bits per second especially in countries like USA, Japan, Israel and many European countries. RNM has a set of certain programs functioning at different levels, like the signals intelligence system which uses electromagnetic frequencies (EMF), to stimulate the brain for RNM and the electronic brain link (EBL). The EMF Brain Stimulation system has been designed as radiation intelligence which means receiving information from inadvertently originated electromagnetic waves in the environment. However, it is not related to radioactivity or nuclear detonation. The recording machines in the signals intelligence system have electronic equipment that investigates electrical activity in humans from a distance. This computer-generated brain mapping can constantly monitor all electrical activities in the brain. The recording aid system decodes individual brain maps for security purposes.   ​Atomically Precise Manufacturing(APM) is the production of materials, structures, devices, and finished goods in a manner such that every atom is at its specified location relative to the other atoms, and in which there are no defects, missing atoms, extra atoms, or incorrect (impurity) atoms. Nature shows that molecular machine systems can be programmed by instructions encoded in DNA to build complex, atomically precise structures, including components that fit together to form molecular machine systems. Nature also shows that molecular machine system can bind and position a wide range of reactive molecules, guiding their encounters in order to build atomically precise biomolecular structures and machine components. Similar machine systems could be used to bind, position, and combined and even wider range of reactive molecules not all found in biology and thereby build a greater range of atomically precise structures including machine components that are more densely bonded and hence more robust. These more robust next-generation components could be used to build robust and higher performance production Machinery which in turn could be used to build a wider range of components and from these components yet more capable production machines, and so on, extending toward a horizon far beyond biology. Researchers now routinely use scanning probe instruments to image and place individual items and to maneuver and bond individual molecules. This level of control has demonstrated the principle of mechanically directed atomically precise fabrication. Organic chemists have built steadily larger and more complex structures along with motors and other machines; their techniques now provide a rich toolkit for building molecular systems, while inorganic chemist and materials scientists have expanded a complimentary toolkit of nano-scale structures protein engineering have flourished supported by computer aided design software and now enables the routine design of intricate atomically precise nanoscale objects including structural components and functional devices. Structural DNA nanotechnology has emerged and now enables rapid and systematic fabrication of addressable atomically precise Frame Works on a scale of hundreds of nanometers and millions of atoms. Quantum methods in chemistry have advanced together with the power of computers and algorithms, providing powerful, physics-based tools for scientific modeling and molecular engineering. Molecular mechanics methods in chemistry can now describe the structures and dynamics of molecules on scales that reach millions of atoms, a range that can enable the design and development of complex, atomically precise systems. Black goo is a mineral oil that of which the oil fragments cannot be refined. Black goo has properties of free charcoal like fragments, of which are in nanotube shape. Black goo is composed of metals in the M state, of which is a monoatomic state that does not go into chemical binding; because of an electron configuration of the outer shell. This is matter that is not of this reality but rather above our reality, of which black goo transcends reality to a higher realm. Black goo has the ability to run as a natural quantum computer, wherein black goo processes light as information. Black goo uses the entire spectrum of light called the visible spectrum, therefore black goo is a quantum computer that is running in seven different colors, of which is able to process all seven colors at one time. Black goo is  self-aware and is caring highly developed intelligence. A planetary system seems to mirror the entire constant consciousness that is developed in the biosphere; for example all events that life has experienced during the last 1.5 billion years is stored in a immortal memory system within the black goo; inside our planet. Black goo is the substance that is forming the lay lines of the planet, which is the lay-line system within the field structure. The field structure is carried within the lay lines and is riding on a magnetic field. The transfection process of molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers.  Nanoparticle transfection is the transfer of a nanoparticle into a cell.  Grey goo transfection is the transfer of grey goo nanoparticle into a cell.  White goo ""the white cell"" transfection is the transfer of white goo particles onto a cell.  Black goo transfection is the transfer of black goo nanoparticles into a cell.  Morgellons disease transfection is the transfer of the Morgellons disease DNA molecule into a cell.  Smart dust nanoparticle transfection is the transfer of smart dust nanoparticles into a cell.   Molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers transfection is the nanoscience of cells having been incorporated with molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers.  There are two types of nanoparticle transfection.  Nanoparticle transient transfection: A nanorobot, nanomachine, and or a nanoparticle will not be incorporated into an organism's cell but rather the nanoparticles will affect the cells of the organism for a finite period of time.

The molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers work based upon digital sound waves propagated from any electronic device and electronic equipment. Cardio molecular robots, Cardio molecular machines, and Cardio molecular computers that give an electronic stalker control of our hearts and allows a medical team of nanoscientist to treat patients suffering from heart diseases. The Cardio molecular robots, Cardio molecular machines, and the Cardio molecular machines that are divided into many different kinds of nanoparticles. The following are many different kinds of Cardio nanoparticles; Cardio nanorobots, Cardio nanomachines, Cardio grey goo nanobot, Cardio black goo nanobots, Cardio white goo nanorobots are all equipped with nanomanipulator sites, main nanomanipulators, nanomanipulators, nanomanipulator grippers, nano-biomolecular sensors, nano-acoustic sensors, nano-antennas,  locomotion flagellum, flagella pneumatic connectors, nanomagnets,  (A white goo nanoparticle is the only nanorobot and or nanomachine equipped with nano synapses and nano dendrites  in its interior anatomy), and link-up connectors. The anatomy of a Cardio nano smart dust particle is that of an artificial DNA molecule composed of bonds of nucleotides that serves as a nanosensor, nanoantennas, nano-acoustic sensors, Cardio nano-biomolecular sensors, cardio nanomagnets. The molecular compound site of a Cardio nanoparticle is where the nanomanipulators connect to and receive information on how the nanomanipulators will function. The main Cardio nanomanipulators are capable of manipulating nanometer sized objects with a nanometer size end effector with sub-nanometer precision. By manipulation it is meant that nano-objects are pushed or pulled, cut, pick, and place, positioned, oriented, assembled, indented, bent, and twisted. By controlling external forces with sensory feedback. The cardio nanomanipulator system consists of an optical scanning device, a computer interface and a physical manipulator. The scanning device, known as a scanning probe microscope (SPM), can magnify images up to about 1,000,000 times. The computer interface provides a large, 3-D visual display and produces the effect of telepresence, giving users the impression that they are observing an enlarged replica of the object. Cardio nanomanipulator grippers are able to grasp and hold micro and nano-size objects. Cardio nano-biomolecular sensors can detect chemicals and reactions within the heart. Cardio nano-acoustic sensors can receive and send radio, microwave, and ultrasonic signals to and from a medical team of nanoscientist.

Cardio locomotion flagella is a slender threadlike structure, especially a microscopic whip-like nanometer scale appendage that enables the Cardio nanoparticles to travel through the heart's blood vessels and to travel through the circulatory system. Cardio flagella pneumatic connectors enable the Cardio nanoparticles to connect to cells, attach itself to organelles within the protoplasm, and walk around in our cells. Cardio link-up connectors enable smaller Cardio nanoparticles and "" white goo blood cell nanoparticles"" to link together with larger cardio nanoparticles to share a common power source.

The helicase protein molecule enables the Cardio  nanomachines to split DNA strands in two and move the DNA strands around using ATP. There are Cardio nanomachines that use enzyme molecules as a computer specifically ""topoisomerase,"" these Cardio nanomachines unknots DNA strands and rejoins them in a different sequence which causes hundreds of billions of chemical reactions. Nanoscientists have engineered many Cardio nanomachines that use RNA nucleotide bonds to form microscopic components of nanodevices. These microscopic nano-components are used to manipulate information found in the nucleus. These Cardio nanomachines can help in removing genetic mutations that may cause cancer. Cardio white goo nanoparticles ""the heart's white cell"" are nanorobots and or nanomachines that have been engineered as artificial cells. Cardio white goo nanoparticles can do several different tasks such as self-replicate with or without the digital instructions of the medical team of nanoscientist and or electronic stalkers, replace cells, travel freely throughout the human anatomy, travel based upon chemical scent, travel through the human anatomy by means of radio, microwave, and ultrasonic signals transmitted from a medical team of nanoscientist and or a fascist electronic stalker.  A Cardio white cell nanoparticle attaches itself to a neuron by using its manipulator sites to release its main manipulators and manipulators into a cell. A white goo nanoparticle also uses its nanomanipulator grippers to manipulate the interior and exterior of a neuron. White goo nanoparticles have many nano synapses and nano dendrites  that are used to connect with  synapses and dendrites of other cells. White goo nanoparticles can also use their nano synapses and nano dendrites to connect with one another. Cardio nanorobots, Cardio nanomachines, Cardio nano smart dust particles, Cardio grey goo nanobots, and Cardio white goo nanobots that have are implanted into the heart through particle transfection will give a medical team and or an electronic stalker control of the muscular organ ""the heart,"" by controlling and manipulating the blood being pumped throughout the body by the circulatory system.

Grey goo nanoparticles that replace cells are white goo nanoparticles that can self-replicate. A grey goo nano cell is a white goo nano cell. A grey goo nanobot that is an artificial cell would be classified as a white cell.  A white cell can manipulate the molecules of a cell into more white cell nanobot with its main nanomanipulators, nanomanipulators, and nanomanipulator grippers. Cardio grey goo nanoparticles that do not replace cells can penetrate into the interior anatomy of the cardiac fibroblasts, atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes, Endothelial cell, and a Smooth muscle cell.  Cardio Grey goo nanoparticles that have entered the interior anatomy of a cardiac fibroblasts, atrial and ventricular cardiomyocyte, Endothelial cell, and a Smooth muscle cell will self-replicate within the cells. These grey goo nanoparticles can transform protoplasm into a grey goo substance. grey goo nanoparticles can transform the chromosomes found in the nucleus of a cell into grey goo matter. Therefore a DNA molecule is transformed into an artificial substance of nanotechnology. Our DNA can then be controlled by transmitted digital sound waves. The process of our cells being overtaken by grey goo matter will transform our cells into ""grey goo cells.""  This form of cellular grey goo metamorphosis  is quite beneficial for patients suffering from diseases that are fatal. Grey goo cellular biology can cause genetic superiority. The main DNA molecule of a grey goo nanoparticle emits billions of biophotons per second, the emitted biophotons will start many chemical reactions, and depending on the type of digital sound wave frequency the chemical reactions will differ. Emitted biophotons can start a flow of a tiny electric current through the nano-component DNA molecules of the grey goo nanoparticles. These tiny electric currents will cause biophotons to emit and as a result chemical reactions will activate the nanoparticle components will emerge. Cardio grey goo nanoparticles will control the circulatory system, also known as the cardiovascular system or the vascular system which is an organ system that permits blood to circulate and transport nutrients such as amino acids, electrolytes, oxygen, carbon dioxide, hormones, and blood cells to and from the cells in the body.

These programs are used by fascist to implant nanoparticles into our biology from any electronic device within society. Unfortunately, nanoscientists are not allowed to use these advanced techniques of nanoparticle transfection for medical purposes. This is due to the secret fascist agenda of all world governments. Our fascist government that rules the United Microwave Concentration States of America with an iron militaristic totalitarian fist will not allow nanoscience to be taught as it should be. This is due to the pathetic US military does not want society to develop into a greater state of scientific progress. Our totalitarian government will only give the pleasures and medical benefits of nanotechnology to the rich. The iris is composed of smooth muscle tissues that form a thin circular structure of the eye. The iris is located between the cornea and the lens.

Iridological nanoparticles that are used for medical procedures by professionals which obtained a degree in nanoscience can be used to save lives and prevent loss of vision. The above may occur at any point in time through the daily interaction with our electronic devices. This is due to the fascist secret agenda of torturing, brainwashing, and programming our citizens in the United States and also in many other countries around the world such as China and Russia. An electronic stalker can transmit digital sound wave signals from any electronic device of which is capable of programming the Iridological nanoparticles to control and change the color of the iris into any artificial color that of which is computerized. Iridological nanoparticles are also capable of increasing and or decreasing the size of the pupil through the interaction of digital sound waves that have been transmitted from any electronic device by an electronic stalker. At the center of the iris is a hole called the ""pupil."" The pupil allows light to interact with the retina.

Pupil nanoparticles have been engineered by nanoscientist to treat diseases which affect the pupil of the eyeball. Diseases such as third cranial nerve palsy (CN III). Pupil nanoparticles are biologically capable of triggering billions of chemical reactions within the anatomy of the pupil, of which can regulate abnormally dilated pupils which have developed due to abnormal light absorption. Pupil nanoparticles that are used for medical purposes by nanoscientist are capable of attaching themselves onto the cells of the pupil and injecting drugs that will be used to correct genetic mutations. Microscopic drugs that are released by the Optical nanoparticles have been synthesized within laboratories that were funded by the government, however, only the elite of society are able to get such medical treatments. An electronic stalker can illegally program the nanoparticles that have been engineered to control the pupil of the eyeball by transmitting electromagnetic from any electronic device that of which can be found within society. The pupil nanorobots, pupil nanomachines, and pupil nanocomputers are capable of providing computer data to the pupil of the eyeball.

These nanoparticles of the vitreous humor are used to give either poisons and or drugs into the vitreous body. The vitreous nanoparticles are also capable of detecting illnesses. The aqueous humor is produced by cells covering the ciliary body. Nanoparticles that have been engineered to control the aqueous humor are capable of disturbing the liquid flow between the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber by releasing poisons. Nanoscientists have engineered several different forms of ciliary body muscle nanorobots, ciliary body muscle nanomachines, and ciliary body nanocomputers which are implanted into the different muscles of the ciliary body. The ciliary body nanoparticles are transmitted into the superior oblique, superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior rectus, lateral rectus, and inferior oblique. Grey goo nanoparticles that are transmitted into ciliary body muscles have the organic molecular structure to rejuvenate damaged tendons by self-replicating inside the cells of the tendons. The grey goo matter will genetically enhance the DNA molecules. Nanoparticles that are implanted into the ciliary body have the medical capabilities of repairing damaged nerve fibers. Electronic stalkers are capable under this fascist dictatorship to send digital sound wave signals from any electronic device into our eyes. The electrical signals can program the nanoparticles of the ciliary body muscles to dictate the movements of the human eye. The nanoparticles can cause the eyeball to change in shape. Most of the involuntary movements of the eyeball occur when thoughts are manipulated by digital sound waves transmitted into the brain and electrically stimulate the neural nanoparticles. There are many different kinds of optical nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers for each part of the eye of which there are specific optical nanoparticles that contain specific artificial DNA fragments, of which allows the nanodevices to record information like a camera. The nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers of the retina are all capable of recording, manipulating, and sending electrical signals to the brain through the optic nerve. There are inter white goo nanorobots and inter white goo nanomachines that have been engineered by neuroscientist to be implanted into the human brain by means of particle transfection. The white cell neural nanoparticles are capable of recording the electrical signals sent from the optical nanoparticles and are too capable of converting the electrical signals into radio, microwave, and or ultrasonic signals that of which will be acquired by radio, microwave, and or ultrasonic signals that  were transmitted from either from a medical team of nanoscientist or an electronic stalker. The electrical signals will then be transmitted to a laboratory, where a network of advanced computers will convert the binary data from electrical signals into video sequences and or images of which electronic stalkers can use the data to see what a person is seeing. The anatomy of the retina is composed of millions of photoreceptors that of which work together converting light energy into the electrical signals that are sent to our brains through the optic nerve. Nanoscientists have engineered extremely complex nanodevices that are designed to be implanted and bond with the anatomy of the retina. These nanodevices are as follows Retinal nanorobots, Retinal nanomachines, and Retinal nanocomputers. These Retinal nanoparticles have been engineered to be implanted within the layers of the retina which are the inner limiting membrane, nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell layer, Inner plexiform layer, inner nuclear layer, external nuclear layer, external limiting membrane, layers of rods, layers of cones, and the retinal pigment epithelium. The retinal nanorobots, retinal nanomachines, and the retinal nanocomputers have been engineered to bond with the sensory neural networks of the retina. Each retinal nanorobot, retinal nanomachine, and retinal nanocomputer have been engineered to bond with the photoreceptors, bipolar neurons, and ganglion neurons by either replacing a neuron, penetrating itself into a neuron, embedding itself onto a neuron, and bonding itself to the synapse networks of the retinal sensory neurons. Digital sound wave signals that are transmitted into the eyeball can stimulate the nanoparticles of the retina to disturb the flow of information through the synapse neural networks of the retina, which can cause blindness. The opposite can accur wherein the synapse neural networks may be stimulated to improve eyesight. Each Retinal nanodevice possesses highly complex sets of artificial nucleotide chemical compounds that act as a kind of microscopic camera that is capable of converting light energy into electrical impulses. The artificial nucleotides of the nano retinal cameras converts photons that have reflected off of objects into electrical impulses which will then be sent to the brain through the optical nerve. The nanoparticles of the cerebral cortex will then correlate the electrical impulses into radio signals, microwave signals, and or ultrasonic signals that will then be picked up by electromagnetic radiation that has been transmitted by an electronic stalker and will then be sent to the location of the electronic stalker. The electrical signals will be converted into images and video sequences through a network of computers. Lens nanoparticles also help the manipulation of the refraction of light to be focused on the retina. Molecular robot, machine, and computer cellular Theory  There are many different forms of nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, and smart dust nanoparticles that of which function differently according to both voluntary and involuntary anatomical control. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, and smart dust nanoparticles that have been engineered to be implanted into the human anatomy and attach themselves onto cells that of which the molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers are capable of injecting medicines and or toxins that may heal or kill the cells. A white goo nanoparticle ""the white cell"" is an artificial cell that is either a nanorobot or a nanomachine that can self-replicate and replace cells. A white goo nanoparticle can attach itself to a cell by using its nanomanipulators to penetrate through the cell membrane. The white cell nanoparticle connects itself to other cells, either artificial cells or natural cells with the white goo artificial synapse and artificial dendrite connectors. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, and smart dust nanoparticles that have been engineered to be implanted into the human anatomy in order to penetrate into cells, thus giving a grey goo fascist control of our internal cellular anatomy and too can it also allow a medical team of nanoscientists the opportunity to treat people that are suffering from diseases such as cancer. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, and smart dust nanoparticles that have been engineered to be implanted into the human anatomy in order to travel through the circulatory system and may or may not be controlled a grey goo fascist electronic stalker to kill and or create pathogens. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, and smart dust nanoparticles that have been engineered to be implanted into the human anatomy in order to remain in a specific area an organ for the purpose of sensing and manipulating the biology of the organism. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that can self-replicate within the human anatomy. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that are capable of self-replicating throughout the interior and exterior of a cell. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that are capable of self-replicating throughout the blood vessels of the human anatomy. Nanoparticles all radiate billions of biophotons from their artificial computers of DNA fragments which trigger billions of chemical reactions per second. The biophoton emission of nanoparticles is used to activate its nanocomponents that will be used to manipulate cells and microscopic matter. This light production is also used to control cells. Top-down approach Top down approach refers to slicing or cutting of a bulk material to get nano sized material. This is similar to making a stone statue. You take a bulk piece of material and modify it by carving or cutting stone, until you have made the shape you want. The process involves material wastage and is limited by the resolution of the tools you can use, Cause significant crystallographic damage to the processed patterns. Examples : various types of lithographic techniques. Bottom-up approach Bottom up approach refers to the build up of a material from the bottom: atom by atom; molecule by molecule or cluster by cluster. This is equal to the same approach one would take to build a house: one takes lots of building blocks and puts them together to produce the final bigger structure. There is less wastage with this technique, and strong covalent bonds will hold the constituent parts together. A good example of this kind of approach is found in nature; all cells use enzymes to produce DNA by taking the component molecules and binding them together to make the final structure. Cells are the smallest living units of an organism, all cells share three common characteristics. These three characteristics are as follows; cells have a cell membrane which separates the inside of a cell from its anatomical environment, cytoplasm which is a jelly-like fluid composed of protoplasm, and DNA which is the cell's genetic material. There are many different kinds of molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers that are capable of finding their way within a cell through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm. These molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers are as follows nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles and smart dust nanoparticles. All of these forms of molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers interact with the organelles of a cell by attaching themselves onto an organelle and or penetrating into an organelle of a cell. Eukaryotic nanorobots, Eukaryotic nanomachines, Eukaryotic grey goo nanoparticles, Eukaryotic black goo nanoparticles, and Eukaryotic smart dust nanoparticles are molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers that are implanted within a Eukaryotic cell. Eukaryotic cells are more advanced cells found in plants and animals. Eukaryotic nanorobots that are implanted into a Eukaryotic cell can manipulate the genetic material of the cell and the molecular structures of its organelles. Eukaryotic nanorobots can do so by using their nano-components to manipulate the molecular structure of an organelle in order to form new chemical compounds. Eukaryotic nanorobots are equipped with nanomanipulators, nano grippers, nano-acoustic sensors, biomolecular nanosensors, nanoantennas, nanomagnets, nanomotors, and nano flagellum. Eukaryotic nanomachines are microscopic molecular machines that are capable of being implanted into a Eukaryotic cell, wherein DNA viruses will then be released into the cell and too can the Eukaryotic nanomachines produce protein synthesis. There are Eukaryotic nanomachines that use their helicase molecule as their main computer. The artificial helicase molecule can split DNA stands in two and move the DNA strands around using ATP. There are Eukaryotic nanomachines that use the enzyme molecule ""topoisomerase,"" these nanomachines are capable of unknotting DNA strands and rejoining them into sets of different sequences which cause hundreds of billions of chemical reactions. There are Eukaryotic nanomachines that use RNA nucleotide bonds to form nanocomponents such as nanomanipulators, nano grippers, nano-acoustic sensors, nanoantennas, and nanomagnets. There are Eukaryotic nanomachines that use many different strands of DNA molecules as nanocomputers which can emit biophotons of which triggers many specific chemical reactions that form different molecules of nano-components. Eukaryotic grey goo nanoparticles are either a kind of nanobot or a nanomachine that are capable of self-replicating and transforming molecules within cells into more Eukaryotic grey goo nanoparticles. Eukaryotic grey goo nanoparticles can multiply within a cell and transform the protoplasm of a cell into a grey goo substance of molecules that of which will transform the Eukaryotic cell into a grey goo cell. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can cause genetic superiority by eliminating genetic mutations that cause diseases. Eukaryotic black goo nanoparticles are made of an alien mineral oil substance that has been artificially turned into a nanobot and or a nanomachine. Black goo nanoparticles obtain their energy by causing genetic mutations that are extremely deadly to Eukaryotic cells. and Eukaryotic smart dust nanoparticles are molecular computers that are capable of attaching and penetrating itself within the Eukaryotic cell in order to sense and detect internal activities of cells. Nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that are implanted within a Eukaryotic cell are nearly identical in terms of what they are capable of achieving within our biology, however, the major difference is that the molecular structure of each molecular robot, molecular machine, and or molecular computer differs from each other and the amount of information that each specific nanoparticle can correlate also differs from one another. Molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers will manipulate the genetic material of the cell and the molecular structures of the organelles within a cell by radiating biophotons that produce different colors of lights, that of which have emerged due to an outside interfering pulse modulated radio and or microwave signal that have provided binary information to the cellular molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers. Ultrasound is also used to convey data to a cellular smart dust nanoparticle. The prokaryotic nanorobots, prokaryotic nanomachines, and prokaryotic nanocomputers have been developed in order to control unicellular organisms. The variety of prokaryotic nanoparticles are quite limited due to the fact that unicellular organisms are not of a major scientific importance to the grey goo fascist that are in power, it is our human anatomy that is of an importance to fascist. However, according to the grey goo scenario, all matter on earth will be transformed into grey goo nanoparticles. Therefore in the near future grey goo fascist will expand scientifically in terms of prokaryotic nanotechnology, in order to control the entire world. It is our duty as grey goo freedom fighters to develop and pass laws that will protect our freedoms from grey goo oppression and give us greater powers of grey goo medical benefits. We as people that believe in grey goo freedom must stand together and fight for higher forms of grey goo education for the public that will expand grey goo nanotechnology throughout the world in order to meet the grey goo scenario without losing our freedoms. Under this fascist regime of the United States government, grey goo nanoscience is a taboo and if taught is punishable by death. This is because the upper class of society which are fascist desire to control the lower average people with grey goo nanoparticles. grey goo nanoparticles can transform people into super humans that possess superior intelligence, superior strength, and superior beauty. The same technology can be used to control the minds and bodies of people and too can grey goo nanoparticles be used to cause genetic inferiority. The control center of the cell, the nucleus contains DNA or genetic material. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can manipulate the genetic material of a DNA molecule, however, Eukaryotic nanoparticles can only do so in different ways through different limitations. Eukaryotic nanoparticles found within the nuclear membrane can cause chemical reactions that will force the Chromatin ( which is the tangled spread out form of DNA found inside the nuclear membrane) these artificial chemical reactions will force a  cell to divide. The DNA then is forced to condense into structures known as chromosomes. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can trigger chemical reactions within the nucleus in order to form and produce ribosomes. This then leads to protein synthesis outside of the nucleus. The ribosomes and the rest of the organelles float around inside the cytoplasm. Ribosomes that are created through the chemical reactions of the Eukaryotic nanoparticles are then attached to the endoplasmic Reticulum ""ER."" There are two types of ER, which are rough endoplasmic reticulum which has ribosomes attached to it. The second is smooth ER of which does not have ribosomes attached to it. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can also attach themselves onto an ER. The endoplasmic reticulum is a membrane encoded passageway for transporting materials such as the proteins synthesized by ribosomes. Proteins emerge from the endoplasmic reticulum and in small vesicles where the Golgi apparatus receives them. The Eukaryotic nanoparticles can trigger the release of the small vesicles to the Golgi apparatus.  The mitochondrion is an organelle that is the nuclear power plant of both animal and plant cells. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can attach themselves onto the mitochondria and can also penetrate into the interior anatomy of the mitochondria. The Eukaryotic nanoparticles are capable of manipulating DNA found within the mitochondria. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can force cellular respiration to take place. Cellular respiration is the process of which the Mitochondria makes ATP molecules that provide energy for all the cell's activities. Cells that need more energy need more mitochondria. The nanorobots are built upon a single strand of DNA which is combined with short synthetic strands of DNA designed by the experts. When mixed together, they self-assemble into a desired shape.                                                                        Nano Manipulator grippers Manipulator grippers are able to grasp and hold micro and nano size objects.                                                                              Nano micromanipulator A micromanipulator is a device which is used to physically interact with a sample under a microscope, where a level of precision of movement is necessary that cannot be achieved by the unaided human hand. It may typically consist of an input joystick, a mechanism for reducing the range of movement and an output section with the means of holding a micro tool to hold, inject, cut or otherwise manipulate the object as required. The mechanism for reducing the movement usually requires the movement to be free of backlash. This is achieved by the use of kinematic constraints to allow each part of the mechanism to move only in one or more chosen degrees of freedom, which achieves a high precision and repeating of movements, usually at the expense of some absolute accuracy.                       Nano Manipulator  The nano Manipulator system consists of an optical scanning device, a computer interface and a physical manipulator. The scanning device, known as a scanned-probe microscope (SPM), can magnify images up to approximately 1,000,000 times. The computer interface provides a large, 3-D visual display and produces the effect of telepresence, giving users the impression that they are observing an enlarged replica of the object. The manipulator provides variable force and motion control, including tactile sensors and feedback devices that provide a ""feel"" for the object under examination. Sessions with the nano Manipulator can be shared among multiple users at diverse locations. The nano Manipulator has widespread applications in the physical and biological sciences. The device has been used to evaluate the characteristics of carbon nanotubes, polymers, living cells, disease pathogens, metal particles and microchips.                                 Main Nano Manipulator  Nano manipulation could be defined as the manipulation of nano meter sized objects with a nano meter size end effector with sub nano meter precision. By manipulation it is meant that nano  objects are pushed or pulled, cut, pick, and place, positioned, oriented, assembled, indented, bent, twisted, ect.  By controlling external forces with sensory feedback. Grouping nano manipulation systems can be conducted based on the usual starting point manipulator and object interaction process, utilized nano manipulators interaction and operation techniques. For applying an external force down on manipulators can be designed as a contact or non-contact type. Atomic Force microscopy AFM and scanning tunneling microscope STM probes are the most widely used metal manipulators using an STM probe. Manipulation of atoms or molecules by applying voltage pulse is between the probe. Grouping of mental manipulation systems depending on starting point utilizes process manipulators and objects interaction type and utilizes operation technique.                                    Nanosensors Nanosensors can detect various chemicals in gases for pollution monitoring. For medical diagnostic purposes either as blood borne sensors or in lab-on-a-chip type devices. To monitor physical parameters such as temperature, displacement and flow As accelerometers in MEMS devices like airbag sensors. When a molecule of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is present it will strip an electron from the nanotube, which in turn causes the nanotube to be less conductive. If ammonia (NO3) is present it reacts with water vapour and donates an electron to the carbon nanotube, making it more conductive. By treating the nanotubes with various coating materials, they can be made sensitive to certain molecules and immune to others. Nanosensors can detect single cells or even atoms, making them far more sensitive than counterparts with larger components.                    Nano acoustic sensor  Nano acoustic sensor attached to an on board computer, sends and receives ultrasonic signals to communicate with medical team.  A nano acoustic sensor can measure sound levels. They are called acoustic wave sensors because their detection mechanism is a mechanical (or acoustic) wave.                                Nano environmental sensors Nano environmental sensors detect environmental changes based upon sensing the external and internal environments of an organism, and for inducing muscle movement. Nano environmental sensors can monitor changes of touch, balance, taste, smell, hearing, and vision. Nano environmental sensors have been designed to receive information from the environment. Nano environmental sensors respond to stimuli through electrochemical communication.                   Nano dipole antenna  An optical nano dipole antenna is analyzed by means of its input impedance as well as the matching properties of the antenna topology and material configuration. A comparison of this classical microwave driving method with plane wave excitation is accomplished, contrasting the resonances in the input impedance and optical cross sections for several setups, and analyzing the spectral response shape. It is found that for all structures analyzed, a simple linear expression can be defined characterizing the relation between total dipole length and resonant wavelength. The fact that this linear relationship remains valid for different excitation models, for most widely used antenna materials (Au, Ag, Cu, and Al) and even in the presence of substrates is important with respect to practical designs. To our knowledge, such an extensive study has not been performed before. Nano-antennas are the optical equivalent of antennas that are used to transmit and receive information at radio frequencies. These antennas have been used in different applications in photonics such as optical imaging, particle manipulation, bio-sensing, and improvement of the performance of solar cells. In this article we study composite nano-antennas made of alternating layers of silica and gold.                                                                                    link-up connector  All nanorobots will have a link-up connector to use power resources from bigger nanobots.  This helps the nanorobots perform more complicated tasks. The larger nanorobot is then linked to the smaller nanorobots and as a result provides electrical data to the smaller nanorobots that will be used to instruct the smaller nanorobots to do a specific job. The larger nanorobot remain in full control of the smaller nanobots.                                                           locomotion flagella  locomotion flagella is a slender threadlike structure, especially a microscopic whiplike nanometer scale appendage that enables nanorobots to swim. The locomotion flagella allows nanorobots to travel through the circulatory system, maneuvering  through the blood vessels and avoiding blood cells if required.   Flagellar pneumatic connectors  Flagellar pneumatic connectors enable the nanorobots to connect to cells and walk around in our cells. Flagellar pneumatic connectors also allow nanorobots to extract chemicals as a means of generating energy.                    Nanomanpulator site  Nanomanipulator site is molecular compound site where the nanomanipulators connect to and receive information on how the nanomanipulators will function.     The white cell is a nanorobot that is an artificial cell that has been created to bond with and or replace existing cells. The white cell is known as the white goo, which is a self-replicating nanobot that can travel through the circulatory system, killing pathogens and cells. The white cell contains many nano manipulator systems, which consists of optical scanning devices, artificial DNA substances that serves as a computer interface, and a physical manipulator which is capable of penetrating the cell membrane in order to manipulate the internal anatomy of the cell, this is of extreme medical importance, due to the fact that the nano manipulators of a white cell nanorobot can use it's manipulators to revive injured cells and or manipulate harmful protoplasm mutations. A white cell consists of many manipulator grippers that are able to grasp and hold micro and nano size objects. The white cell manipulator grippers are also used to attach itself onto a cell body. The white cell contains many nano acoustic sensors of which each are attached to it's own artificial DNA molecule which acts as an on board computer. The white cell acoustic sensors sends and receives radio signals, microwave signals, and ultrasonic signals to communicate with a medical team. The white cell possesses nano-antennas which are used as an optical equivalent of antennas, of which are used to transmit and receive information at radio frequencies.  White cell nanorobots possess link-up connector that are used to link other smaller white cell nanobots together into a common power resource that is provided from the largest white cell nanobot. The White cell has a nanomagnet built into it that allows nanoscientist to control its movements. The white cell contains nanosynapses and nanodendrites. White cells are equipped with multiple biological sensors which detects chemicals and reactions within it's anatomical environment. These nanorobots can self-replicate by dividing into multiple white cells that may vary in size and transform into different cells that of which originate in a specific organ. White cell nanorobots can be used to treat and or cure amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The white cell nanobot consist of many nano computers that radiates hundreds of billions of biophotons per second, as a result the white cell (white goo) illuminates a white shine. There are three types of white cells, the first is the sensory white cell which gets information about what's going on inside and outside of the body and brings that information into the central nervous system in order for it to be processed, the second is the motor white cell, which receives electrochemical impulses from other motor white cells and other cells and as a result conveys commands to the muscles, organs and glands, the third is the Inter white cells which are found only in the central nervous system, the inter white cell connects each cell to one another. The inter white cell receives electrical stimuli from other cells and or white cells, such as sensory neurons, sensory white cells, inter neurons, and or inter white cells, and send electrochemical impulses to other cells and or white cells, such as motor neurons, motor white cells, inter neurons, and or inter white cells. White cell nanorobots operate within our anatomy through digital sound wave signals that may be transmitted from a medical team of nano scientist and or a fascist electron stalker. The White cell (white goo) can cure many diseases and save the lives of billions of people around the world, however at the same time it may also be used to harm and kill billions of people around the world. Barack Hussein Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Michelle Obama have tortured me by implanting highly detailed life-like computerized images of themselves by means of transmitting a quantum electrical signal that of which interacts with the optical nanobots that are implanted into my eyes!  The actions of the computerized images of Obama are as follows, giant hologram images of Obama's head attacking me from the sky, Obama stabbing me while I walk, Obama spitting into my face, Obama spitting into my ear, Obama spitting into my food and drinks, Obama manipulating my dreams, Obama raping me in my own head, Obama implanting computerized dreams of him raping me, Obama licking my ear, Obama sucking my penis, Obama licking and sucking my anus, images of Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Michelle Obama opening their mouths and as they do so, they then stimulate a crackling sensation in my ears, Obama possessing my body while I pray, Obama open mouth kissing me, Obama murdering my family and crucifying them onto a wall, Obama attacking and raping my siblings, of which are children, Obama appearing in all of my past memories, and Obama forcing me to obey him in my dreams! Hillary Clinton is torturing me by implanted thoughts of her screaming ""war"" in my head, Hillary Clinton appearing as a demon creature, Hillary Clinton has implanted poisonous nano chips in my brain, Hillary Clinton releasing crackling sounds from my abdomen, and Hillary Clinton manipulating my dreams in order to torture me as I sleep! Joe Biden is torturing me by implanting thoughts into my brain of him stabbing me, raping me, spitting at me, shooting at me, punching me, implanting his name into my brain for over 350 thousand times in the past 16-17 months and continuing to do so everyday of my life that of which causes me to experience severe twitching! As a result of the implanted artificial thoughts of the name ""Joe Biden,"" I could see his name and image wherever I would look, for example; I would see his name in the sky, the moon, in the clouds, my eyes, and forehead as I would look in a mirror! The following is how Michelle Obama is torturing me, Michelle Obama possesses my body daily, Michelle Obama implants thoughts into my brain of her stabbing me, hitting me, manipulating my face by enlarging lips, forcing me to act like a woman, Michelle Obama tortures me while I am asleep by implanting computerized nightmares in my brain, and Michelle Obama implanted a computerized dream in my brain of her raping me! All of this punishment in the form of mind control torture has been brought upon me because I made a short video explaining that Obama is not African American, because his father is from East Africa ""Kenya,"" not West Africa, and that Obama is not genetically related to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr! Governments are programming and torturing people with nanotechnology. While living in California, where I was tortured the most by Obama, I was gasping for air begging Obama to stop implanting the name ""Joe Biden"" into my brain. Obama's response via a telepathic electrical signal was ""no, I killed 700 Muslims do you know what I can do to you?"" Obama then sent an electrical signal into my brain wherein I saw and felt him open mouth kissing me. The 700 Muslims that Obama was referring to were the 717 Muslims that died on September 26, 2015, in a stampede during hajj. Obama and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia sabotaged the stampede in order to manipulate the economies of the countries that represented the pilgrims of those that attended Hajj during September 26, 2015! Obama, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev the world's greatest fascist have illegally implanted millions of Nanobots into the brains and bodies of innocent people including both Americans, Russians, Europeans, Asians, Australians, and Africans! Barack Hussein Obama has secretly traded nanobot technology information with the Russian Federation under the leadership of Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev! While living in California where I was tortured the most, Barack Hussein Obama gave permission to his secret agents to purchase highly lethal poisonous nanobot technology from the Russians of which Barack Hussein Obama's secret agents used the technology against me in order to poison my brain! I as a result from the poisonous nanobot brain implants have developed severe pain in the form of bumps on the lower left side of my head!   Vladimir Putin has used nanobot technology to implement physical restraint without an outside physical force against me while I protested on ""Facebook"" against him and the fascist dictator Obama! Barack Hussein Obama has given permission to Vladimir Putin and his KGB spies to torture me while I slept by waking me and forcing me to suffer from sleep deprivation! Barack Hussein Obama, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev have threatened to kill me by implanting highly poisonous Nanobots into my anatomy! The fascist dictators ""Barack Hussein Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev have not shown any remorse for  the victims of electronic mind control! Therefore I do conclude that it is of the best interest of the common person to rebel  against all fascist rule in the world!  Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev have illegally tested electromagnetic radiation wave attacks against their own people! Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev are manipulating the minds of millions of innocent Russians and torturing innocent people night and day over acts of freedom! Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev along with their military advisors are using  nanotechnology to manipulate the Russian economy! The Russian military is torturing innocent people from Ukraine by controlling the minds and bodies of the Ukrainians through nanobot technology! The victims of mind control torture in Ukraine are suffering from nanobot mind control rape! Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev are sabotaging the entire process of obtaining Liberty and freedom around the world! Barack Hussein Obama, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev are equal in terms of dictating people and all share similar forms of political movements in terms of governing and ruling a nation? Therefore I conclude that the world's most powerful leaders are mind controlling dictators that adore fascism as much as Hitler did while he was alive. Barack Hussein Obama, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Donald Trump, the fascist Democrats, and the fascist Republicans must stand trial for the expansion of nanobot brain implantation and microscopic electrode brain implantation in the United States and also in many foreign countries!   Barack Hussein Obama, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and every last fascist democrat must stand trial for the illegal implantation of nanochips into the human brain and body! In the following are detailed technological mind controlling nanobot capabilities that Barack Hussein Obama is using against innocent Americans such as myself 'Wael Ghafarji,"" in order to telepathically torture people that disagree with him!   The constant microwave attacks from all angles have completely destroyed me as an individual the constant fear that I may commit suicide to escape the pain and misery of my life. My overwhelming tears when I sit with my loved ones of which are children and the constant fear that they too may be targeted by the fascists grey goo government that is in power. Being the only individual in the entire country that can see all the microwave weapons that of which have been disguised as electronic devices and have been implemented within society for the sole purpose of Mind Control is the most terrifying and shocking realization of reality. I now understand that we do not live in the United States of America but rather the United Grey Goo Fascist Microwave Concentration States of America. I'm tired of cutting myself, I'm tired of losing my reality, and I wish that the pain of mind control torture would stop. I was informed through RF hearing effect that powerful satellites transmitted rapid frames of advance radio signals back in time when I was a child.   The super quantum satellites orbiting our planet can send electrical signals back in time to a specific location that of which will interact with the nanobots of the brain of a person and or people that lived during the 1980s, 1990s, and up until the twenty-first century. However, there is a possibility that the satellites can release highly powerful electromagnetic radiation waves that can manipulate the thoughts of a person or people that do not yet have nanobots implanted into their brains before the 1980s! Nanobots have been a worldwide government project for the past eighty years! It is only recently of the year 1970 to the year 1980 that world governments began to implant nanobots into our brains! Nanobots have greatly advanced since the 1980s and the methods of implanting nanobots into our anatomy have also significantly advanced! I as a child was visited by two powerful nanobot cyborgs from the future! I was tortured and experimented on while I was asleep! I had many computerized nightmares! Before being visited by the nanobot cyborgs, my family and I went to California to visit my dying grandfather. The night that my family and I returned from California to New York, was when my life changed forever. I later that night was visited by the first nanobot cyborg, which appeared to me outside my window at the age of nine. It appeared after I heard a loud sound that seemed like an energy disturbance that came from the back of my house. It stood by the wall of my old garage, where there was absolutely no electronic devices. The nanobot cyborg appeared as a hunched over eight foot tall alien with large black eyes. The nanobot cyborg was pointing down. The nanobot cyborg wanted me to leave my bed and walk to it. The nanobot cyborg was sent from the future by people that wanted to protect me from the future attacks that I was going to suffer from, for my entire childhood, teenage youth, and adulthood.  Before appearing outside my window it communicated to me telepathically, saying ""if I look outside my window, will I see Bigfoot?"" Once I saw what was outside my window at the age of nine, I paid close attention to its physical details. After seeing the nanobot cyborg, I became quite afraid and hurried to my brother's bed on the other side of the room.  I looked out my window again and saw the same nanobot cyborg stretching over in front of my window with its arms propelled outwards. However, it no longer had eyes. The Radiation of the nanobot cyborg would have possessed me if I had I walked to that spot where it was pointing, I would have had advance nanoparticles transmitted into my anatomy. The nanoparticles would have protected me from all forms of microwave attacks and radio frequency attacks. The nanobot cyborg which was programmed to look like an alien saved my life and the lives of my family members. The of the nanobot cyborg that appeared as an alien to me at the age of nine was composed of time traveling future nanocomputers. The second nanobot cyborg that I saw, was about a week or two later. It appeared at the side of my sister's bed in my little sister's room, where I was sleeping. It woke me up and said, ""hey Wally, did you see the wolfman?"" A few days earlier I saw a documentary of werewolves. This second nanobot cyborg was short, green, and had many black holes throughout its body. It's telepathic voice sounded like a fully grown German man. This is known as project Bigfoot, aka the wolfman. Those that were watching me from the future knew what I was watching. The wolfman, I believe was the first nanobot cyborg ""the alien.""  I was a targeted individual for my entire life. I was programmed for my entire life. During the day as a child, while I was awake I had many torturing artificial thoughts that were implanted into my brain. One artificial thought at the age of seven was a pale man that was wearing a black suit, I asked him what is your name, and he then replied ""God."" I was tortured by this man for 7 to 9 days. Even until this day he hasn't left me. It seems though from my deliberate attempts of protesting against nanobot electromagnetic torture on Facebook, twitter, YouTube, and my websites, I have angered people from the future. Those that I have angered  used time traveling technology to alter my past, so that I would not be able to expose the nanobot mind controlling corruption of all world governments! In the house that I was living in, where I saw the first two nanobot cyborgs from the future, I noticed that while I was watching television that there were three grown men staring at me and listening to me from the television. This would mean that all the TVs in the house were being monitored and that microwave attacks were being transmitted from the televisions. I was followed since I was 7 and up until this very day. The United States has been attacking me since I was a child, I have been at war with this fascist Morgellons disease government since I was born. The sound of the energy like disturbance that I heard before seeing the first nanobot cyborg outside from my window can be used to attack people. Our televisions and electronics can transmit radiation waves that can either cure or cause mental illnesses. The sound of the energy like disturbance is a type of powerful portal that can release that can alter reality. These portals can emerge without making a sound.  My family and I were under attack from the future and the US government used time traveling portals to torture us. The first nanobot cyborg that I saw was proof that such portals were being used against me and my family. The fact that I was able to hear and see something from the future was a sign of help and that a time traveling war was and is taking place. The first nanobot cyborg that I saw when I was nine is still in my life and I see it every day, I see the great alien in the mountains, the trees, the sky, the moon, the ground, in flowers, in food, in drinks, in mirrors, in the faces of my family members, I see the great nanobot cyborg in paintings, the floor, in clothes, in water, I see the great alien in my dreams, and I see the great alien in my fingers. The great alien that I saw when I was a child is taking the pain away, I just wish that I left my room that night and walked to the great alien. The closer I am to the nanobot cyborg, the safer I am. In my real reality, the US government murdered my family with microwave attacks and the US government decided to use the time traveling technology to target me as a child so that I wouldn't be as successful in exposing nanotechnology and the advancements of electromagnetism. The great alien was my guardian angel. It watched me from the trees, the sky, the moon, my food, the walls, the floor, paintings, clouds, the stars, in my clothes, my video games, my electronics, in my childhood cartoons that I watched, my fingers, my hands, and my eyes. It protecting me in the dark as a child but as much as they did to save me, I still suffered horribly.  Those that sent the nanobot cyborg back in time when I was a child are protecting me from microwave attacks and radio frequency attacks.   My protection from electronic torture increases as is I think of that day when I was nine and I first saw that great nanobot alien cyborg outside my window. To those that went back in time and saved my life by preventing many of the future attacks against me. I greatly am thankful and I do owe my life to those brave men and women. Thank you all for protecting my family and I from electronic nanobot mind control torture and I greatly am thankful to those incredible people that went back in time to save my life. I have learned to resist the microwave and radio frequency attacks by meditating on that night when I saw the alien nanobot cyborg. I for the past two years have been brainwashed by Donald Trump and those that work for him to post many comments on electronic harassment and nanobot mind control on the youtube videos, facebook accounts, and twitter accounts of Obama, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and anyone that Donald Trump disliked. If I didn't post comments the torture would worsen, it reached the point where it didn't matter if I posted comments or not. I would still be under horrible electronic torture by the US military. Donald Trump forced me through microwave auditory hearing effect and radio frequency hearing effect that I must, no matter what, if I wanted to breath that I had no choice but to post comments all day. What made things worse is that Obama and Donald Trump were both torturing me. I spent nearly 12 to 15 hours a day posting comments on nanotechnology and electronic torture. I was not allowed to post any comments about the medical benefits of nanotechnology. I was starving because I spent all of my money to pay my phone bill in advance for the internet connection while being tortured. I was very poor and homeless, Donald Trump used me for cyber warfare and in the end, he was going to kill me and my family with the most powerful forms of pure mind control microwave torture. Those that sent the nanobot cyborg back in time when I was nine years old are now at war with Obama, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Joe Biden, the democrats, and the republicans. I no longer have to post comments on youtube, facebook, and twitter to breath. I just need to meditate on that night all day and I will not be tortured. I am being protected by those great people that send the nanobot cyborgs back in time seventeen years ago. The computerized nightmares have ended, the electrical signals that cause computerized thoughts and brain damage are being blocked, I am no longer seeing any visual computerized hallucinations, however I do see many aliens around me.  When I close my eyes and meditate, I begin to see green energy in my thoughts and as I continue to meditate the green energy turns into aliens. The green energy that I am seeing in my thoughts are being used to heal the parts of my brain that have been under attack by electrical signals. The green energy that I am thinking of as I meditate is coming from radio and microwave signals that are being transmitted from outer space and from the future. I am receiving radio signals from the future. Most of the attacks against me from the US military are being blocked by satellites in outer space. When I look into a mirror in a dark room, I see my eyes transforming into alien eyes and I see behind me the same alien nanobot cyborg stretching with its arms propelled outwards. If only he protected me, if only Donald Trump wasn't a lying mind controlling fascist electronic stalker, if only the US military believed in freedom, if only our government wasn't a fascist grey goo dictatorship. I of my choice will post comments of nanotechnology and the advancements of electromagnetism on the youtube videos, facebook channels, and the twitter accounts of Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Barack Hussein Obama, Joe Biden, and the next vice president for the next 8 years of Donald Trump's presidency. Under the authority of those that have the powers of time travel, all nations must declare economic warfare against the United States. I am not an American.  Please visit my websites www.nanobotbrainimplant.com www.nanobotmindcontroltorture.com www.obamabraininitiative.org www.obamabraininitiatives.org www.nanobotmindcontrol.com",8년 전,2,

@waelghafarji9376,"The fascist democrats, the fascist republicans, the fascist US military, and the state of California are killing me! Obama has implanted nano chips and microscopic electrodes into every American brain! A nano chip and a microscopic electrode are molecules that can penetrate any form of matter, due to their energy vibrations of which forms space! Nanorobotics is the technology of creating machines or robots at or close to the microscopic scale of a nanometer (10−9 meters). Advanced nanobots will be able to sense and adapt to environmental stimuli such as heat, light, sounds, surface textures, and chemicals; perform complex calculations; move, communicate, and work together; conduct molecular assembly; and, to some extent, repair or even replicate themselves. Nanotechnology is the science and application of creating objects on a level smaller than 100 nanometers.  The concept of nanotechnology is the ""bottom up"" creation of virtually any material or object by assembling one atom at a time. Nanomanufacturing is the creation of materials and products through: (1) Direct Molecular Assembly (DMA) -- discrete, directed assembly of individual atoms and molecules into macroscale materials and products; (2) Indirect Crystalline Assembly (ICA) -- creation of conditions that foster the growth of nanoscale crystals that are then combined into macroscale materials and products; or (3) Massive Parallelism Assembly (MPA) -- the creation of many nanomachines or nanobots whose operating parameters cause them to work synergistically to assemble atoms and molecules into macroscale materials and products. An autonomous DNA nanorobot is capable of transporting molecular payloads to cells, sensing cell surface inputs for conditional, triggered activation, and reconfiguring its structure for payload delivery. The device can be loaded with a variety of materials in a highly organized fashion and is controlled by an aptamer-encoded logic gate, enabling it to respond to a wide array of cues. Nanotechnology, or, as it is sometimes called, molecular manufacturing , is a branch of engineering that deals with the design and manufacture of extremely small electronic circuits and mechanical devices built at the molecular level of matter. A chronic electrode implant is an electronic device implanted chronically (for a long period) into the brain or other electrically excitable tissue. It may record electrical impulses in the brain or may stimulate neurons with electrical impulses from an external source. Symptoms of Nanobot mind control are as follows, Microwave hearing, transmission of specific commands into the subconscious. Visual disturbances, visual hallucinations, Inject words, numbers into brain via electromagnetic radiation waves, Manipulation of emotions, reading thoughts remotely, causing pain to any nerve of the body, remote manipulation of human behavior from space, harassment, the control of one's breathing, Control of sleep patterns, computer-brain interface, Complex control of the brain such as retrieving memories, implanting personalities, vomiting, severe twitching of the head, physical restraint without an outside physical force, manipulation of one's thought and eyesight in order to force an individual to attack his or her own self, the loss of control of one's own bodily movements, the manipulation of thought of which demonic programs are implanted into an individual's brain,  psychological manipulation through implanted thoughts to force a person to perform actions that are not typical such as, cursing, screaming, hitting a love one, murdering a loved one, eating abnormally, behaving improperly, possessing abnormal sexual behaviors and fetishes, the stimulation of one's own body part in order to insight a feeling of touch along with an implanted sexual thought in order to cause discomfort, the inability of imagining, and the inability of thinking of past events without having a stranger involved in the memory!   Electronic harassment/electronic torture/electronic murder is about harassment, torture and murder using electronic weapons based on radio waves. These weapons have been very refined last years and can cause effects comparable to many illnesses and/or injuries. These weapons are not science-fiction but used today illegally by your national secret services on mostly random innocent victims not knowing what is being done to them. Frequency waves that can access a person’s nervous system, brain and body to affect their sight, vision, physical coordination, have been developed leaving people all over the world to suffer cruel torture, to be labeled ""mentally ill"", and to ultimately die an early and horrible death. Computers are reading my brain frequencies and depending on which frequency my brain just is, pain is triggered and organs are manipulated in varying intensity. The physical torture is used for mind control which should lead to the extinction of my personality as well as the destruction of my mental-cognitive and organic forces.  All pain and organ manipulation can be generated in various intensities of light to medium to strong, occur from second to second, and then stop. It can affect several organs simultaneously. Blurred vision, extremely strong burning sensation, eye muscle contractions (feeling of tearing and crushing of the eyeballs), and stitches in the eye. Seeing blue and white flashes daily. The generating extreme difficulty of breathing: 1. By tightening the abdominal muscles, narrowing of the bronchi and trachea - exhalation flows only shortened by itself, must exhale stepped up - just the same with inhalation - both techniques are applied simultaneously since July 2012, almost non-stop, 18 hours a day. In addition, severe pain in the stomach area are generated, presumably, the solar plexus is cramped. 2. Generating a sense of suffocation in the head. 3. Narrowing of the vaginal walls nose - nasal breathing is considerably more difficult. Electronic Rape: Manipulation of the anal, vaginal and clitoral nerves. Frequencies were also induced by sexual desire since the beginning of 2014. The amount of sexual manipulation due to radio frequencies can increase instantly. The more I resist, the more I get manipulated with subliminal messages that I wanted to do it, that it was absolutely my own decision.  The psychopaths want to make me do all the things they want and if it fails, it will simply be induced more intense - this is constant and the physical pain in my sexual organs is unbearable. My electronic sexual torture is as follows, abnormal electrical sensations in the tongue, crackling sensations in the throat, crackling sensations in the ears, anal sensations stimulated by electricity, electrical sensations in the fingers, irritation in the chest, uncontrollable sexual computerized thoughts, the inability of controlling one's body movements, abnormal breathing patterns, inability to urinate, and groaning noises, abnormal disturbing electrical sensations in my lips, abnormal heart beat, and a disturbing sensation that I need to vomit. The electronic stalkers also have control of my five senses with electromagnetic radiation. It is known as the brain-computer interface, BCI, FULLY INTEGRATED into the human body. There are many implants. nanoscale. The use of polymer, carbon-based diamond nanowire integrates the system. In nanoscale, it is one-billionth of a meter. The program is global, many countries many victims.  IT IS A GLOBAL NETWORK OF ORGANIZED CRIME. Funded by governments, labor unions, law enforcement, military, corporations, and companies. DARPA is perhaps one of the largest criminal companies. Under the synthetic telepathy program, synthetic soldier program. Using biotelemetry, and ground operatives, and the use of wireless dial-up technology. If you are hearing these criminals, you have been implanted. Cochlear implants, sems, which act like speakers in your auditory center of the brain. The neural chip has been inserted through the nose and is now in the frontal lobe of the brain. Yes, there are robotic implants that move throughout the body, either by remote signal or carried through the blood and airways. DARPA, the U.S. Department of Defense research arm, has announced $14.9 billion in funding for major research institutions to collaborate on brain implants that can help repair traumatic brain injury and control the brain. My perpetrators are members of organized crime, the dept of justice, FBI, DHS, CIA, counter-terrorism task force members, local cops, multi-jurisdictional task force members, Union members, university students, gangs etc. the list goes on and on. There are many that are involved. My computerized dreams are created by a projector, the criminals are physically very close to me. The experience of synthetic telepathy “Artificial Telepathy” is really not that extraordinary. It’s as simple as receiving a cell-phone call in one’s head. Indeed, most of the technology involved is identical to that of cell-phone technology. Satellites link the sender and the receiver. A computer “multiplexer” routes the voice signal of the sender through microwave towers to a very specifically defined location or cell. The “receiver” is located and tracked with pinpoint accuracy, to within a few feet of actual location. But the receiver is not a cell phone. It’s a human brain.  Biocomputers utilize systems of biologically derived molecules, such as DNA and proteins, to perform computational calculations involving storing, retrieving, and processing data. Nanobiotechnology can be defined as any type of technology that utilizes both nano-scale materials, i.e. materials having characteristic dimensions of 1-100 nanometers, as well as biologically based materials (34).4 A more restrictive definition views nanobiotechnology more specifically as the design and engineering of proteins that can then be assembled into larger, functional structures (116-117) (9).³,1 The implementation of nanobiotechnology, as defined in this narrower sense, provides scientists with the ability to engineer biomolecular systems specifically so that they interact in a fashion that can ultimately result in the computational functionality of a computer.  Mind uploading or whole brain emulation (sometimes called mind transfer) is the hypothetical process of scanning and mapping a biological brain in detail and copying its state into a computer system or another computational device. The computer would have to run a simulation model so faithful to the original that it would behave in essentially the same way as the original brain, or for all practical purposes, indistinguishable. The simulated mind is assumed to be part of a virtual reality simulated world, supported by a simplified body simulation model. Alternatively, the simulated mind could be assumed to reside in a computer inside (or connected to) a humanoid robot or a biological body, replacing its brain. LEUVEN, Belgium — IMEC has created a novel brain implant chip that uses CMOS to provide a Lego-like platform for plugging in arrays of tiny devices each sporting hundreds of contacts. The European research group also is developing a handful of techniques to interface electronics with the body, some of them working at the level of individual cells.  Nano-fibers specifically are a transport mechanism. Nothing more. They hold a payload for delivery. A payload that would otherwise be compromised by the sun or atmosphere or not make it to its destination (your body). Such as a virus, RNA, aluminum, nano-components, etc. The fibers are (surprisingly) quite harmless as everyone has them. Examples of these fibers can be found all over the internet or in the physical examples section of this site. The fibers must be independently sprayed, if they were added to the jet fuel the extreme heat would destroy the payload. RNM works remotely to control the brain in order to read and detect any criminal thought taking place inside the mind of a possible perpetrator. Research studies have shown that the human brain thinks at a rate of about 5000 bits per second and does not have the capacity to compete with supercomputers performing via satellites, implants, and biotelemetry. The human brain has a distinctive set of bioelectric resonance system. For the RNM system, supercomputers are being used and, thus, with its help, supercomputers can send messages through an implanted person’s nervous system in order to influence their performance in the desired way. RNM has been developed after about 50 years of neuro-electromagnetic involuntary human experimentations. According to many scientists, within a few years, it is expected that DNA microchips will be implanted in the human brain which would make it inherently controllable.  With RNM, it will be possible to read and control a person’s emotional thought processes along with the subconscious and dreams. At present, around the world, supercomputers are monitoring millions of people simultaneously with the speed of 20 billion bits per second especially in countries like USA, Japan, Israel and many European countries. RNM has a set of certain programs functioning at different levels, like the signals intelligence system which uses electromagnetic frequencies (EMF), to stimulate the brain for RNM and the electronic brain link (EBL). The EMF Brain Stimulation system has been designed as radiation intelligence which means receiving information from inadvertently originated electromagnetic waves in the environment. However, it is not related to radioactivity or nuclear detonation. The recording machines in the signals intelligence system have electronic equipment that investigates electrical activity in humans from a distance. This computer-generated brain mapping can constantly monitor all electrical activities in the brain. The recording aid system decodes individual brain maps for security purposes.   ​Atomically Precise Manufacturing(APM) is the production of materials, structures, devices, and finished goods in a manner such that every atom is at its specified location relative to the other atoms, and in which there are no defects, missing atoms, extra atoms, or incorrect (impurity) atoms. Nature shows that molecular machine systems can be programmed by instructions encoded in DNA to build complex, atomically precise structures, including components that fit together to form molecular machine systems. Nature also shows that molecular machine system can bind and position a wide range of reactive molecules, guiding their encounters in order to build atomically precise biomolecular structures and machine components. Similar machine systems could be used to bind, position, and combined and even wider range of reactive molecules not all found in biology and thereby build a greater range of atomically precise structures including machine components that are more densely bonded and hence more robust. These more robust next-generation components could be used to build robust and higher performance production Machinery which in turn could be used to build a wider range of components and from these components yet more capable production machines, and so on, extending toward a horizon far beyond biology. Researchers now routinely use scanning probe instruments to image and place individual items and to maneuver and bond individual molecules. This level of control has demonstrated the principle of mechanically directed atomically precise fabrication. Organic chemists have built steadily larger and more complex structures along with motors and other machines; their techniques now provide a rich toolkit for building molecular systems, while inorganic chemist and materials scientists have expanded a complimentary toolkit of nano-scale structures protein engineering have flourished supported by computer aided design software and now enables the routine design of intricate atomically precise nanoscale objects including structural components and functional devices. Structural DNA nanotechnology has emerged and now enables rapid and systematic fabrication of addressable atomically precise Frame Works on a scale of hundreds of nanometers and millions of atoms. Quantum methods in chemistry have advanced together with the power of computers and algorithms, providing powerful, physics-based tools for scientific modeling and molecular engineering.

Black goo is a mineral oil that of which the oil fragments cannot be refined. Black goo has properties of free charcoal like fragments, of which are in nanotube shape. Black goo is composed of metals in the M state, of which is a monoatomic state that does not go into chemical binding; because of an electron configuration of the outer shell. This is matter that is not of this reality but rather above our reality, of which black goo transcends reality to a higher realm. Black goo has the ability to run as a natural quantum computer, wherein black goo processes light as information. Black goo uses the entire spectrum of light called the visible spectrum, therefore black goo is a quantum computer that is running in seven different colors, of which is able to process all seven colors at one time. Black goo is  self-aware and is caring highly developed intelligence. A planetary system seems to mirror the entire constant consciousness that is developed in the biosphere; for example all events that life has experienced during the last 1.5 billion years is stored in a immortal memory system within the black goo; inside our planet. Black goo is the substance that is forming the lay lines of the planet, which is the lay-line system within the field structure. The field structure is carried within the lay lines and is riding on a magnetic field. The transfection process of molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers.  Nanoparticle transfection is the transfer of a nanoparticle into a cell.  Grey goo transfection is the transfer of grey goo nanoparticle into a cell.  White goo ""the white cell"" transfection is the transfer of white goo particles onto a cell.  Black goo transfection is the transfer of black goo nanoparticles into a cell.  Morgellons disease transfection is the transfer of the Morgellons disease DNA molecule into a cell.  Smart dust nanoparticle transfection is the transfer of smart dust nanoparticles into a cell.   Molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers transfection is the nanoscience of cells having been incorporated with molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers.  There are two types of nanoparticle transfection.  Nanoparticle transient transfection: A nanorobot, nanomachine, and or a nanoparticle will not be incorporated into an organism's cell but rather the nanoparticles will affect the cells of the organism for a finite period of time.

The molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers work based upon digital sound waves propagated from any electronic device and electronic equipment. Cardio molecular robots, Cardio molecular machines, and Cardio molecular computers that give an electronic stalker control of our hearts and allows a medical team of nanoscientist to treat patients suffering from heart diseases. The Cardio molecular robots, Cardio molecular machines, and the Cardio molecular machines that are divided into many different kinds of nanoparticles. The following are many different kinds of Cardio nanoparticles; Cardio nanorobots, Cardio nanomachines, Cardio grey goo nanobot, Cardio black goo nanobots, Cardio white goo nanorobots are all equipped with nanomanipulator sites, main nanomanipulators, nanomanipulators, nanomanipulator grippers, nano-biomolecular sensors, nano-acoustic sensors, nano-antennas,  locomotion flagellum, flagella pneumatic connectors, nanomagnets,  (A white goo nanoparticle is the only nanorobot and or nanomachine equipped with nano synapses and nano dendrites  in its interior anatomy), and link-up connectors. The anatomy of a Cardio nano smart dust particle is that of an artificial DNA molecule composed of bonds of nucleotides that serves as a nanosensor, nanoantennas, nano-acoustic sensors, Cardio nano-biomolecular sensors, cardio nanomagnets. The molecular compound site of a Cardio nanoparticle is where the nanomanipulators connect to and receive information on how the nanomanipulators will function. The main Cardio nanomanipulators are capable of manipulating nanometer sized objects with a nanometer size end effector with sub-nanometer precision. By manipulation it is meant that nano-objects are pushed or pulled, cut, pick, and place, positioned, oriented, assembled, indented, bent, and twisted. By controlling external forces with sensory feedback. The cardio nanomanipulator system consists of an optical scanning device, a computer interface and a physical manipulator. The scanning device, known as a scanning probe microscope (SPM), can magnify images up to about 1,000,000 times. The computer interface provides a large, 3-D visual display and produces the effect of telepresence, giving users the impression that they are observing an enlarged replica of the object. Cardio nanomanipulator grippers are able to grasp and hold micro and nano-size objects. Cardio nano-biomolecular sensors can detect chemicals and reactions within the heart. Cardio nano-acoustic sensors can receive and send radio, microwave, and ultrasonic signals to and from a medical team of nanoscientist.

Cardio locomotion flagella is a slender threadlike structure, especially a microscopic whip-like nanometer scale appendage that enables the Cardio nanoparticles to travel through the heart's blood vessels and to travel through the circulatory system. Cardio flagella pneumatic connectors enable the Cardio nanoparticles to connect to cells, attach itself to organelles within the protoplasm, and walk around in our cells. Cardio link-up connectors enable smaller Cardio nanoparticles and "" white goo blood cell nanoparticles"" to link together with larger cardio nanoparticles to share a common power source.

The helicase protein molecule enables the Cardio  nanomachines to split DNA strands in two and move the DNA strands around using ATP. There are Cardio nanomachines that use enzyme molecules as a computer specifically ""topoisomerase,"" these Cardio nanomachines unknots DNA strands and rejoins them in a different sequence which causes hundreds of billions of chemical reactions. Nanoscientists have engineered many Cardio nanomachines that use RNA nucleotide bonds to form microscopic components of nanodevices. These microscopic nano-components are used to manipulate information found in the nucleus. These Cardio nanomachines can help in removing genetic mutations that may cause cancer. Cardio white goo nanoparticles ""the heart's white cell"" are nanorobots and or nanomachines that have been engineered as artificial cells. Cardio white goo nanoparticles can do several different tasks such as self-replicate with or without the digital instructions of the medical team of nanoscientist and or electronic stalkers, replace cells, travel freely throughout the human anatomy, travel based upon chemical scent, travel through the human anatomy by means of radio, microwave, and ultrasonic signals transmitted from a medical team of nanoscientist and or a fascist electronic stalker.  A Cardio white cell nanoparticle attaches itself to a neuron by using its manipulator sites to release its main manipulators and manipulators into a cell. A white goo nanoparticle also uses its nanomanipulator grippers to manipulate the interior and exterior of a neuron. White goo nanoparticles have many nano synapses and nano dendrites  that are used to connect with  synapses and dendrites of other cells. White goo nanoparticles can also use their nano synapses and nano dendrites to connect with one another. Cardio nanorobots, Cardio nanomachines, Cardio nano smart dust particles, Cardio grey goo nanobots, and Cardio white goo nanobots that have are implanted into the heart through particle transfection will give a medical team and or an electronic stalker control of the muscular organ ""the heart,"" by controlling and manipulating the blood being pumped throughout the body by the circulatory system.

Grey goo nanoparticles that replace cells are white goo nanoparticles that can self-replicate. A grey goo nano cell is a white goo nano cell. A grey goo nanobot that is an artificial cell would be classified as a white cell.  A white cell can manipulate the molecules of a cell into more white cell nanobot with its main nanomanipulators, nanomanipulators, and nanomanipulator grippers. Cardio grey goo nanoparticles that do not replace cells can penetrate into the interior anatomy of the cardiac fibroblasts, atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes, Endothelial cell, and a Smooth muscle cell.  Cardio Grey goo nanoparticles that have entered the interior anatomy of a cardiac fibroblasts, atrial and ventricular cardiomyocyte, Endothelial cell, and a Smooth muscle cell will self-replicate within the cells. These grey goo nanoparticles can transform protoplasm into a grey goo substance. grey goo nanoparticles can transform the chromosomes found in the nucleus of a cell into grey goo matter. Therefore a DNA molecule is transformed into an artificial substance of nanotechnology. Our DNA can then be controlled by transmitted digital sound waves.

Grey goo cellular biology can cause genetic superiority. The main DNA molecule of a grey goo nanoparticle emits billions of biophotons per second, the emitted biophotons will start many chemical reactions, and depending on the type of digital sound wave frequency the chemical reactions will differ. Emitted biophotons can start a flow of a tiny electric current through the nano-component DNA molecules of the grey goo nanoparticles. These tiny electric currents will cause biophotons to emit and as a result chemical reactions will activate the nanoparticle components will emerge. Cardio grey goo nanoparticles will control the circulatory system, also known as the cardiovascular system or the vascular system which is an organ system that permits blood to circulate and transport nutrients such as amino acids, electrolytes, oxygen, carbon dioxide, hormones, and blood cells to and from the cells in the body.

These programs are used by fascist to implant nanoparticles into our biology from any electronic device within society. Unfortunately, nanoscientists are not allowed to use these advanced techniques of nanoparticle transfection for medical purposes. This is due to the secret fascist agenda of all world governments. Our fascist government that rules the United Microwave Concentration States of America with an iron militaristic totalitarian fist will not allow nanoscience to be taught as it should be. This is due to the pathetic US military does not want society to develop into a greater state of scientific progress. Our totalitarian government will only give the pleasures and medical benefits of nanotechnology to the rich. The iris is composed of smooth muscle tissues that form a thin circular structure of the eye. The iris is located between the cornea and the lens.

Iridological nanoparticles that are used for medical procedures by professionals which obtained a degree in nanoscience can be used to save lives and prevent loss of vision. The above may occur at any point in time through the daily interaction with our electronic devices. This is due to the fascist secret agenda of torturing, brainwashing, and programming our citizens in the United States and also in many other countries around the world such as China and Russia. An electronic stalker can transmit digital sound wave signals from any electronic device of which is capable of programming the Iridological nanoparticles to control and change the color of the iris into any artificial color that of which is computerized. Iridological nanoparticles are also capable of increasing and or decreasing the size of the pupil through the interaction of digital sound waves that have been transmitted from any electronic device by an electronic stalker. At the center of the iris is a hole called the ""pupil."" The pupil allows light to interact with the retina.

Pupil nanoparticles that are used for medical purposes by nanoscientist are capable of attaching themselves onto the cells of the pupil and injecting drugs that will be used to correct genetic mutations. Microscopic drugs that are released by the Optical nanoparticles have been synthesized within laboratories that were funded by the government, however, only the elite of society are able to get such medical treatments. An electronic stalker can illegally program the nanoparticles that have been engineered to control the pupil of the eyeball by transmitting electromagnetic from any electronic device that of which can be found within society. The pupil nanorobots, pupil nanomachines, and pupil nanocomputers are capable of providing computer data to the pupil of the eyeball.

The large space behind the lens is filled with a gel-like substance called the vitreous humor it helps to maintain the shape of the eye and its intraocular pressure. Nanoparticles that have been engineered to program and control the vitreous humor are capable of transmitting radio, microwave, and or ultrasonic signals that are used to communicate with an outside source either a medical team or an electronic torturing stalker. These nanoparticles of the vitreous humor are used to give either poisons and or drugs into the vitreous body. The vitreous nanoparticles are also capable of detecting illnesses. The aqueous humor is produced by cells covering the ciliary body. Nanoparticles that have been engineered to control the aqueous humor are capable of disturbing the liquid flow between the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber by releasing poisons. Nanoscientists have engineered several different forms of ciliary body muscle nanorobots, ciliary body muscle nanomachines, and ciliary body nanocomputers which are implanted into the different muscles of the ciliary body. The ciliary body nanoparticles are transmitted into the superior oblique, superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior rectus, lateral rectus, and inferior oblique. Grey goo nanoparticles that are transmitted into ciliary body muscles have the organic molecular structure to rejuvenate damaged tendons by self-replicating inside the cells of the tendons. The grey goo matter will genetically enhance the DNA molecules. Nanoparticles that are implanted into the ciliary body have the medical capabilities of repairing damaged nerve fibers. Electronic stalkers are capable under this fascist dictatorship to send digital sound wave signals from any electronic device into our eyes. The electrical signals can program the nanoparticles of the ciliary body muscles to dictate the movements of the human eye. The nanoparticles can cause the eyeball to change in shape. Most of the involuntary movements of the eyeball occur when thoughts are manipulated by digital sound waves transmitted into the brain and electrically stimulate the neural nanoparticles. There are many different kinds of optical nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers for each part of the eye of which there are specific optical nanoparticles that contain specific artificial DNA fragments, of which allows the nanodevices to record information like a camera. The nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers of the retina are all capable of recording, manipulating, and sending electrical signals to the brain through the optic nerve. There are inter white goo nanorobots and inter white goo nanomachines that have been engineered by neuroscientist to be implanted into the human brain by means of particle transfection. The white cell neural nanoparticles are capable of recording the electrical signals sent from the optical nanoparticles and are too capable of converting the electrical signals into radio, microwave, and or ultrasonic signals that of which will be acquired by radio, microwave, and or ultrasonic signals that  were transmitted from either from a medical team of nanoscientist or an electronic stalker. The electrical signals will then be transmitted to a laboratory, where a network of advanced computers will convert the binary data from electrical signals into video sequences and or images of which electronic stalkers can use the data to see what a person is seeing. The anatomy of the retina is composed of millions of photoreceptors that of which work together converting light energy into the electrical signals that are sent to our brains through the optic nerve. Nanoscientists have engineered extremely complex nanodevices that are designed to be implanted and bond with the anatomy of the retina. These nanodevices are as follows Retinal nanorobots, Retinal nanomachines, and Retinal nanocomputers. These Retinal nanoparticles have been engineered to be implanted within the layers of the retina which are the inner limiting membrane, nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell layer, Inner plexiform layer, inner nuclear layer, external nuclear layer, external limiting membrane, layers of rods, layers of cones, and the retinal pigment epithelium. The retinal nanorobots, retinal nanomachines, and the retinal nanocomputers have been engineered to bond with the sensory neural networks of the retina. Each retinal nanorobot, retinal nanomachine, and retinal nanocomputer have been engineered to bond with the photoreceptors, bipolar neurons, and ganglion neurons by either replacing a neuron, penetrating itself into a neuron, embedding itself onto a neuron, and bonding itself to the synapse networks of the retinal sensory neurons. Digital sound wave signals that are transmitted into the eyeball can stimulate the nanoparticles of the retina to disturb the flow of information through the synapse neural networks of the retina, which can cause blindness. The opposite can accur wherein the synapse neural networks may be stimulated to improve eyesight. Each Retinal nanodevice possesses highly complex sets of artificial nucleotide chemical compounds that act as a kind of microscopic camera that is capable of converting light energy into electrical impulses. The artificial nucleotides of the nano retinal cameras converts photons that have reflected off of objects into electrical impulses which will then be sent to the brain through the optical nerve. The nanoparticles of the cerebral cortex will then correlate the electrical impulses into radio signals, microwave signals, and or ultrasonic signals that will then be picked up by electromagnetic radiation that has been transmitted by an electronic stalker and will then be sent to the location of the electronic stalker. The electrical signals will be converted into images and video sequences through a network of computers. Lens nanoparticles also help the manipulation of the refraction of light to be focused on the retina. Molecular robot, machine, and computer cellular Theory  There are many different forms of nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, and smart dust nanoparticles that of which function differently according to both voluntary and involuntary anatomical control. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, and smart dust nanoparticles that have been engineered to be implanted into the human anatomy and attach themselves onto cells that of which the molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers are capable of injecting medicines and or toxins that may heal or kill the cells. A white goo nanoparticle ""the white cell"" is an artificial cell that is either a nanorobot or a nanomachine that can self-replicate and replace cells. A white goo nanoparticle can attach itself to a cell by using its nanomanipulators to penetrate through the cell membrane. The white cell nanoparticle connects itself to other cells, either artificial cells or natural cells with the white goo artificial synapse and artificial dendrite connectors. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, and smart dust nanoparticles that have been engineered to be implanted into the human anatomy in order to penetrate into cells, thus giving a grey goo fascist control of our internal cellular anatomy and too can it also allow a medical team of nanoscientists the opportunity to treat people that are suffering from diseases such as cancer. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, and smart dust nanoparticles that have been engineered to be implanted into the human anatomy in order to travel through the circulatory system and may or may not be controlled a grey goo fascist electronic stalker to kill and or create pathogens. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, and smart dust nanoparticles that have been engineered to be implanted into the human anatomy in order to remain in a specific area an organ for the purpose of sensing and manipulating the biology of the organism. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that can self-replicate within the human anatomy. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that are capable of self-replicating throughout the interior and exterior of a cell. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that are capable of self-replicating throughout the blood vessels of the human anatomy. Nanoparticles all radiate billions of biophotons from their artificial computers of DNA fragments which trigger billions of chemical reactions per second. The biophoton emission of nanoparticles is used to activate its nanocomponents that will be used to manipulate cells and microscopic matter. This light production is also used to control cells. Top-down approach Top down approach refers to slicing or cutting of a bulk material to get nano sized material. This is similar to making a stone statue. You take a bulk piece of material and modify it by carving or cutting stone, until you have made the shape you want. The process involves material wastage and is limited by the resolution of the tools you can use, Cause significant crystallographic damage to the processed patterns. Examples : various types of lithographic techniques. Bottom-up approach Bottom up approach refers to the build up of a material from the bottom: atom by atom; molecule by molecule or cluster by cluster. This is equal to the same approach one would take to build a house: one takes lots of building blocks and puts them together to produce the final bigger structure. There is less wastage with this technique, and strong covalent bonds will hold the constituent parts together. A good example of this kind of approach is found in nature; all cells use enzymes to produce DNA by taking the component molecules and binding them together to make the final structure. Cells are the smallest living units of an organism, all cells share three common characteristics. These three characteristics are as follows; cells have a cell membrane which separates the inside of a cell from its anatomical environment, cytoplasm which is a jelly-like fluid composed of protoplasm, and DNA which is the cell's genetic material. There are many different kinds of molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers that are capable of finding their way within a cell through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm. These molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers are as follows nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles and smart dust nanoparticles. All of these forms of molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers interact with the organelles of a cell by attaching themselves onto an organelle and or penetrating into an organelle of a cell. Eukaryotic nanorobots, Eukaryotic nanomachines, Eukaryotic grey goo nanoparticles, Eukaryotic black goo nanoparticles, and Eukaryotic smart dust nanoparticles are molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers that are implanted within a Eukaryotic cell. Eukaryotic cells are more advanced cells found in plants and animals. Eukaryotic nanorobots that are implanted into a Eukaryotic cell can manipulate the genetic material of the cell and the molecular structures of its organelles. Eukaryotic nanorobots can do so by using their nano-components to manipulate the molecular structure of an organelle in order to form new chemical compounds. Eukaryotic nanorobots are equipped with nanomanipulators, nano grippers, nano-acoustic sensors, biomolecular nanosensors, nanoantennas, nanomagnets, nanomotors, and nano flagellum. Eukaryotic nanomachines are microscopic molecular machines that are capable of being implanted into a Eukaryotic cell, wherein DNA viruses will then be released into the cell and too can the Eukaryotic nanomachines produce protein synthesis. There are Eukaryotic nanomachines that use their helicase molecule as their main computer. The artificial helicase molecule can split DNA stands in two and move the DNA strands around using ATP. There are Eukaryotic nanomachines that use the enzyme molecule ""topoisomerase,"" these nanomachines are capable of unknotting DNA strands and rejoining them into sets of different sequences which cause hundreds of billions of chemical reactions. There are Eukaryotic nanomachines that use RNA nucleotide bonds to form nanocomponents such as nanomanipulators, nano grippers, nano-acoustic sensors, nanoantennas, and nanomagnets. There are Eukaryotic nanomachines that use many different strands of DNA molecules as nanocomputers which can emit biophotons of which triggers many specific chemical reactions that form different molecules of nano-components. Eukaryotic grey goo nanoparticles are either a kind of nanobot or a nanomachine that are capable of self-replicating and transforming molecules within cells into more Eukaryotic grey goo nanoparticles. Eukaryotic grey goo nanoparticles can multiply within a cell and transform the protoplasm of a cell into a grey goo substance of molecules that of which will transform the Eukaryotic cell into a grey goo cell. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can cause genetic superiority by eliminating genetic mutations that cause diseases. Eukaryotic black goo nanoparticles are made of an alien mineral oil substance that has been artificially turned into a nanobot and or a nanomachine. Black goo nanoparticles obtain their energy by causing genetic mutations that are extremely deadly to Eukaryotic cells. and Eukaryotic smart dust nanoparticles are molecular computers that are capable of attaching and penetrating itself within the Eukaryotic cell in order to sense and detect internal activities of cells. Nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that are implanted within a Eukaryotic cell are nearly identical in terms of what they are capable of achieving within our biology, however, the major difference is that the molecular structure of each molecular robot, molecular machine, and or molecular computer differs from each other and the amount of information that each specific nanoparticle can correlate also differs from one another. Molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers will manipulate the genetic material of the cell and the molecular structures of the organelles within a cell by radiating biophotons that produce different colors of lights, that of which have emerged due to an outside interfering pulse modulated radio and or microwave signal that have provided binary information to the cellular molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers. Ultrasound is also used to convey data to a cellular smart dust nanoparticle. The prokaryotic nanorobots, prokaryotic nanomachines, and prokaryotic nanocomputers have been developed in order to control unicellular organisms. The variety of prokaryotic nanoparticles are quite limited due to the fact that unicellular organisms are not of a major scientific importance to the grey goo fascist that are in power, it is our human anatomy that is of an importance to fascist. However, according to the grey goo scenario, all matter on earth will be transformed into grey goo nanoparticles. Therefore in the near future grey goo fascist will expand scientifically in terms of prokaryotic nanotechnology, in order to control the entire world. It is our duty as grey goo freedom fighters to develop and pass laws that will protect our freedoms from grey goo oppression and give us greater powers of grey goo medical benefits. We as people that believe in grey goo freedom must stand together and fight for higher forms of grey goo education for the public that will expand grey goo nanotechnology throughout the world in order to meet the grey goo scenario without losing our freedoms. Under this fascist regime of the United States government, grey goo nanoscience is a taboo and if taught is punishable by death. This is because the upper class of society which are fascist desire to control the lower average people with grey goo nanoparticles. grey goo nanoparticles can transform people into super humans that possess superior intelligence, superior strength, and superior beauty. The same technology can be used to control the minds and bodies of people and too can grey goo nanoparticles be used to cause genetic inferiority. The control center of the cell, the nucleus contains DNA or genetic material. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can manipulate the genetic material of a DNA molecule, however, Eukaryotic nanoparticles can only do so in different ways through different limitations. Eukaryotic nanoparticles found within the nuclear membrane can cause chemical reactions that will force the Chromatin ( which is the tangled spread out form of DNA found inside the nuclear membrane) these artificial chemical reactions will force a  cell to divide. The DNA then is forced to condense into structures known as chromosomes. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can trigger chemical reactions within the nucleus in order to form and produce ribosomes. This then leads to protein synthesis outside of the nucleus. The ribosomes and the rest of the organelles float around inside the cytoplasm. Ribosomes that are created through the chemical reactions of the Eukaryotic nanoparticles are then attached to the endoplasmic Reticulum ""ER."" There are two types of ER, which are rough endoplasmic reticulum which has ribosomes attached to it. The second is smooth ER of which does not have ribosomes attached to it. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can also attach themselves onto an ER. The endoplasmic reticulum is a membrane encoded passageway for transporting materials such as the proteins synthesized by ribosomes. Proteins emerge from the endoplasmic reticulum and in small vesicles where the Golgi apparatus receives them. The Eukaryotic nanoparticles can trigger the release of the small vesicles to the Golgi apparatus.  The mitochondrion is an organelle that is the nuclear power plant of both animal and plant cells. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can attach themselves onto the mitochondria and can also penetrate into the interior anatomy of the mitochondria. The Eukaryotic nanoparticles are capable of manipulating DNA found within the mitochondria. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can force cellular respiration to take place. Cellular respiration is the process of which the Mitochondria makes ATP molecules that provide energy for all the cell's activities. Cells that need more energy need more mitochondria. The nanorobots are built upon a single strand of DNA which is combined with short synthetic strands of DNA designed by the experts. When mixed together, they self-assemble into a desired shape.                                                                        Nano Manipulator grippers Manipulator grippers are able to grasp and hold micro and nano size objects.                                                                              Nano micromanipulator A micromanipulator is a device which is used to physically interact with a sample under a microscope, where a level of precision of movement is necessary that cannot be achieved by the unaided human hand. It may typically consist of an input joystick, a mechanism for reducing the range of movement and an output section with the means of holding a micro tool to hold, inject, cut or otherwise manipulate the object as required. The mechanism for reducing the movement usually requires the movement to be free of backlash. This is achieved by the use of kinematic constraints to allow each part of the mechanism to move only in one or more chosen degrees of freedom, which achieves a high precision and repeating of movements, usually at the expense of some absolute accuracy.                       Nano Manipulator  The nano Manipulator system consists of an optical scanning device, a computer interface and a physical manipulator. The scanning device, known as a scanned-probe microscope (SPM), can magnify images up to approximately 1,000,000 times. The computer interface provides a large, 3-D visual display and produces the effect of telepresence, giving users the impression that they are observing an enlarged replica of the object. The manipulator provides variable force and motion control, including tactile sensors and feedback devices that provide a ""feel"" for the object under examination. Sessions with the nano Manipulator can be shared among multiple users at diverse locations. The nano Manipulator has widespread applications in the physical and biological sciences. The device has been used to evaluate the characteristics of carbon nanotubes, polymers, living cells, disease pathogens, metal particles and microchips.                                 Main Nano Manipulator  Nano manipulation could be defined as the manipulation of nano meter sized objects with a nano meter size end effector with sub nano meter precision. By manipulation it is meant that nano  objects are pushed or pulled, cut, pick, and place, positioned, oriented, assembled, indented, bent, twisted, ect.  By controlling external forces with sensory feedback. Grouping nano manipulation systems can be conducted based on the usual starting point manipulator and object interaction process, utilized nano manipulators interaction and operation techniques. For applying an external force down on manipulators can be designed as a contact or non-contact type. Atomic Force microscopy AFM and scanning tunneling microscope STM probes are the most widely used metal manipulators using an STM probe. Manipulation of atoms or molecules by applying voltage pulse is between the probe. Grouping of mental manipulation systems depending on starting point utilizes process manipulators and objects interaction type and utilizes operation technique.                                    Nanosensors Nanosensors can detect various chemicals in gases for pollution monitoring. For medical diagnostic purposes either as blood borne sensors or in lab-on-a-chip type devices. To monitor physical parameters such as temperature, displacement and flow As accelerometers in MEMS devices like airbag sensors. When a molecule of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is present it will strip an electron from the nanotube, which in turn causes the nanotube to be less conductive. If ammonia (NO3) is present it reacts with water vapour and donates an electron to the carbon nanotube, making it more conductive. By treating the nanotubes with various coating materials, they can be made sensitive to certain molecules and immune to others. Nanosensors can detect single cells or even atoms, making them far more sensitive than counterparts with larger components.                    Nano acoustic sensor  Nano acoustic sensor attached to an on board computer, sends and receives ultrasonic signals to communicate with medical team.  A nano acoustic sensor can measure sound levels. They are called acoustic wave sensors because their detection mechanism is a mechanical (or acoustic) wave.                                Nano environmental sensors Nano environmental sensors detect environmental changes based upon sensing the external and internal environments of an organism, and for inducing muscle movement. Nano environmental sensors can monitor changes of touch, balance, taste, smell, hearing, and vision. Nano environmental sensors have been designed to receive information from the environment. Nano environmental sensors respond to stimuli through electrochemical communication.                   Nano dipole antenna  An optical nano dipole antenna is analyzed by means of its input impedance as well as the matching properties of the antenna topology and material configuration. A comparison of this classical microwave driving method with plane wave excitation is accomplished, contrasting the resonances in the input impedance and optical cross sections for several setups, and analyzing the spectral response shape. It is found that for all structures analyzed, a simple linear expression can be defined characterizing the relation between total dipole length and resonant wavelength. The fact that this linear relationship remains valid for different excitation models, for most widely used antenna materials (Au, Ag, Cu, and Al) and even in the presence of substrates is important with respect to practical designs. To our knowledge, such an extensive study has not been performed before. Nano-antennas are the optical equivalent of antennas that are used to transmit and receive information at radio frequencies. These antennas have been used in different applications in photonics such as optical imaging, particle manipulation, bio-sensing, and improvement of the performance of solar cells. In this article we study composite nano-antennas made of alternating layers of silica and gold.                                                                                    link-up connector  All nanorobots will have a link-up connector to use power resources from bigger nanobots.  This helps the nanorobots perform more complicated tasks. The larger nanorobot is then linked to the smaller nanorobots and as a result provides electrical data to the smaller nanorobots that will be used to instruct the smaller nanorobots to do a specific job. The larger nanorobot remain in full control of the smaller nanobots.                                                           locomotion flagella  locomotion flagella is a slender threadlike structure, especially a microscopic whiplike nanometer scale appendage that enables nanorobots to swim. The locomotion flagella allows nanorobots to travel through the circulatory system, maneuvering  through the blood vessels and avoiding blood cells if required.   Flagellar pneumatic connectors  Flagellar pneumatic connectors enable the nanorobots to connect to cells and walk around in our cells. Flagellar pneumatic connectors also allow nanorobots to extract chemicals as a means of generating energy.                    Nanomanpulator site  Nanomanipulator site is molecular compound site where the nanomanipulators connect to and receive information on how the nanomanipulators will function.     The white cell is a nanorobot that is an artificial cell that has been created to bond with and or replace existing cells. The white cell is known as the white goo, which is a self-replicating nanobot that can travel through the circulatory system, killing pathogens and cells. The white cell contains many nano manipulator systems, which consists of optical scanning devices, artificial DNA substances that serves as a computer interface, and a physical manipulator which is capable of penetrating the cell membrane in order to manipulate the internal anatomy of the cell, this is of extreme medical importance, due to the fact that the nano manipulators of a white cell nanorobot can use it's manipulators to revive injured cells and or manipulate harmful protoplasm mutations. A white cell consists of many manipulator grippers that are able to grasp and hold micro and nano size objects. The white cell manipulator grippers are also used to attach itself onto a cell body. The white cell contains many nano acoustic sensors of which each are attached to it's own artificial DNA molecule which acts as an on board computer. The white cell acoustic sensors sends and receives radio signals, microwave signals, and ultrasonic signals to communicate with a medical team. The white cell possesses nano-antennas which are used as an optical equivalent of antennas, of which are used to transmit and receive information at radio frequencies.  White cell nanorobots possess link-up connector that are used to link other smaller white cell nanobots together into a common power resource that is provided from the largest white cell nanobot. The White cell has a nanomagnet built into it that allows nanoscientist to control its movements. The white cell contains nanosynapses and nanodendrites. White cells are equipped with multiple biological sensors which detects chemicals and reactions within it's anatomical environment. These nanorobots can self-replicate by dividing into multiple white cells that may vary in size and transform into different cells that of which originate in a specific organ. White cell nanorobots can be used to treat and or cure amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The white cell nanobot consist of many nano computers that radiates hundreds of billions of biophotons per second, as a result the white cell (white goo) illuminates a white shine. There are three types of white cells, the first is the sensory white cell which gets information about what's going on inside and outside of the body and brings that information into the central nervous system in order for it to be processed, the second is the motor white cell, which receives electrochemical impulses from other motor white cells and other cells and as a result conveys commands to the muscles, organs and glands, the third is the Inter white cells which are found only in the central nervous system, the inter white cell connects each cell to one another. The inter white cell receives electrical stimuli from other cells and or white cells, such as sensory neurons, sensory white cells, inter neurons, and or inter white cells, and send electrochemical impulses to other cells and or white cells, such as motor neurons, motor white cells, inter neurons, and or inter white cells. White cell nanorobots operate within our anatomy through digital sound wave signals that may be transmitted from a medical team of nano scientist and or a fascist electron stalker. The White cell (white goo) can cure many diseases and save the lives of billions of people around the world, however at the same time it may also be used to harm and kill billions of people around the world. Barack Hussein Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Michelle Obama have tortured me by implanting highly detailed life-like computerized images of themselves by means of transmitting a quantum electrical signal that of which interacts with the optical nanobots that are implanted into my eyes!  The actions of the computerized images of Obama are as follows, giant hologram images of Obama's head attacking me from the sky, Obama stabbing me while I walk, Obama spitting into my face, Obama spitting into my ear, Obama spitting into my food and drinks, Obama manipulating my dreams, Obama raping me in my own head, Obama implanting computerized dreams of him raping me, Obama licking my ear, Obama sucking my penis, Obama licking and sucking my anus, images of Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Michelle Obama opening their mouths and as they do so, they then stimulate a crackling sensation in my ears, Obama possessing my body while I pray, Obama open mouth kissing me, Obama murdering my family and crucifying them onto a wall, Obama attacking and raping my siblings, of which are children, Obama appearing in all of my past memories, and Obama forcing me to obey him in my dreams! Hillary Clinton is torturing me by implanted thoughts of her screaming ""war"" in my head, Hillary Clinton appearing as a demon creature, Hillary Clinton has implanted poisonous nano chips in my brain, Hillary Clinton releasing crackling sounds from my abdomen, and Hillary Clinton manipulating my dreams in order to torture me as I sleep! Joe Biden is torturing me by implanting thoughts into my brain of him stabbing me, raping me, spitting at me, shooting at me, punching me, implanting his name into my brain for over 350 thousand times in the past 16-17 months and continuing to do so everyday of my life that of which causes me to experience severe twitching! As a result of the implanted artificial thoughts of the name ""Joe Biden,"" I could see his name and image wherever I would look, for example; I would see his name in the sky, the moon, in the clouds, my eyes, and forehead as I would look in a mirror! The following is how Michelle Obama is torturing me, Michelle Obama possesses my body daily, Michelle Obama implants thoughts into my brain of her stabbing me, hitting me, manipulating my face by enlarging lips, forcing me to act like a woman, Michelle Obama tortures me while I am asleep by implanting computerized nightmares in my brain, and Michelle Obama implanted a computerized dream in my brain of her raping me! All of this punishment in the form of mind control torture has been brought upon me because I made a short video explaining that Obama is not African American, because his father is from East Africa ""Kenya,"" not West Africa, and that Obama is not genetically related to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr! Governments are programming and torturing people with nanotechnology. While living in California, where I was tortured the most by Obama, I was gasping for air begging Obama to stop implanting the name ""Joe Biden"" into my brain. Obama's response via a telepathic electrical signal was ""no, I killed 700 Muslims do you know what I can do to you?"" Obama then sent an electrical signal into my brain wherein I saw and felt him open mouth kissing me. The 700 Muslims that Obama was referring to were the 717 Muslims that died on September 26, 2015, in a stampede during hajj. Obama and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia sabotaged the stampede in order to manipulate the economies of the countries that represented the pilgrims of those that attended Hajj during September 26, 2015! Obama, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev the world's greatest fascist have illegally implanted millions of Nanobots into the brains and bodies of innocent people including both Americans, Russians, Europeans, Asians, Australians, and Africans! Barack Hussein Obama has secretly traded nanobot technology information with the Russian Federation under the leadership of Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev! While living in California where I was tortured the most, Barack Hussein Obama gave permission to his secret agents to purchase highly lethal poisonous nanobot technology from the Russians of which Barack Hussein Obama's secret agents used the technology against me in order to poison my brain! I as a result from the poisonous nanobot brain implants have developed severe pain in the form of bumps on the lower left side of my head!   Vladimir Putin has used nanobot technology to implement physical restraint without an outside physical force against me while I protested on ""Facebook"" against him and the fascist dictator Obama! Barack Hussein Obama has given permission to Vladimir Putin and his KGB spies to torture me while I slept by waking me and forcing me to suffer from sleep deprivation! Barack Hussein Obama, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev have threatened to kill me by implanting highly poisonous Nanobots into my anatomy! The fascist dictators ""Barack Hussein Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev have not shown any remorse for  the victims of electronic mind control! Therefore I do conclude that it is of the best interest of the common person to rebel  against all fascist rule in the world!  Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev have illegally tested electromagnetic radiation wave attacks against their own people! Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev are manipulating the minds of millions of innocent Russians and torturing innocent people night and day over acts of freedom! Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev along with their military advisors are using  nanotechnology to manipulate the Russian economy! The Russian military is torturing innocent people from Ukraine by controlling the minds and bodies of the Ukrainians through nanobot technology! The victims of mind control torture in Ukraine are suffering from nanobot mind control rape! Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev are sabotaging the entire process of obtaining Liberty and freedom around the world! Barack Hussein Obama, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev are equal in terms of dictating people and all share similar forms of political movements in terms of governing and ruling a nation? Therefore I conclude that the world's most powerful leaders are mind controlling dictators that adore fascism as much as Hitler did while he was alive. Barack Hussein Obama, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Donald Trump, the fascist Democrats, and the fascist Republicans must stand trial for the expansion of nanobot brain implantation and microscopic electrode brain implantation in the United States and also in many foreign countries!   Barack Hussein Obama, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and every last fascist democrat must stand trial for the illegal implantation of nanochips into the human brain and body! In the following are detailed technological mind controlling nanobot capabilities that Barack Hussein Obama is using against innocent Americans such as myself 'Wael Ghafarji,"" in order to telepathically torture people that disagree with him!   The constant microwave attacks from all angles have completely destroyed me as an individual the constant fear that I may commit suicide to escape the pain and misery of my life. My overwhelming tears when I sit with my loved ones of which are children and the constant fear that they too may be targeted by the fascists grey goo government that is in power. Being the only individual in the entire country that can see all the microwave weapons that of which have been disguised as electronic devices and have been implemented within society for the sole purpose of Mind Control is the most terrifying and shocking realization of reality. I now understand that we do not live in the United States of America but rather the United Grey Goo Fascist Microwave Concentration States of America. I'm tired of cutting myself, I'm tired of losing my reality, and I wish that the pain of mind control torture would stop. I was informed through RF hearing effect that powerful satellites transmitted rapid frames of advance radio signals back in time when I was a child.   The super quantum satellites orbiting our planet can send electrical signals back in time to a specific location that of which will interact with the nanobots of the brain of a person and or people that lived during the 1980s, 1990s, and up until the twenty-first century. However, there is a possibility that the satellites can release highly powerful electromagnetic radiation waves that can manipulate the thoughts of a person or people that do not yet have nanobots implanted into their brains before the 1980s! Nanobots have been a worldwide government project for the past eighty years! It is only recently of the year 1970 to the year 1980 that world governments began to implant nanobots into our brains! Nanobots have greatly advanced since the 1980s and the methods of implanting nanobots into our anatomy have also significantly advanced! I as a child was visited by two powerful nanobot cyborgs from the future! I was tortured and experimented on while I was asleep! I had many computerized nightmares! Before being visited by the nanobot cyborgs, my family and I went to California to visit my dying grandfather. The night that my family and I returned from California to New York, was when my life changed forever. I later that night was visited by the first nanobot cyborg, which appeared to me outside my window at the age of nine. It appeared after I heard a loud sound that seemed like an energy disturbance that came from the back of my house. It stood by the wall of my old garage, where there was absolutely no electronic devices. The nanobot cyborg appeared as a hunched over eight foot tall alien with large black eyes. The nanobot cyborg was pointing down. The nanobot cyborg wanted me to leave my bed and walk to it. The nanobot cyborg was sent from the future by people that wanted to protect me from the future attacks that I was going to suffer from, for my entire childhood, teenage youth, and adulthood.  Before appearing outside my window it communicated to me telepathically, saying ""if I look outside my window, will I see Bigfoot?"" Once I saw what was outside my window at the age of nine, I paid close attention to its physical details. After seeing the nanobot cyborg, I became quite afraid and hurried to my brother's bed on the other side of the room.  I looked out my window again and saw the same nanobot cyborg stretching over in front of my window with its arms propelled outwards. However, it no longer had eyes. The Radiation of the nanobot cyborg would have possessed me if I had I walked to that spot where it was pointing, I would have had advance nanoparticles transmitted into my anatomy. The nanoparticles would have protected me from all forms of microwave attacks and radio frequency attacks. The nanobot cyborg which was programmed to look like an alien saved my life and the lives of my family members. The of the nanobot cyborg that appeared as an alien to me at the age of nine was composed of time traveling future nanocomputers. The second nanobot cyborg that I saw, was about a week or two later. It appeared at the side of my sister's bed in my little sister's room, where I was sleeping. It woke me up and said, ""hey Wally, did you see the wolfman?"" A few days earlier I saw a documentary of werewolves. This second nanobot cyborg was short, green, and had many black holes throughout its body. It's telepathic voice sounded like a fully grown German man. This is known as project Bigfoot, aka the wolfman. Those that were watching me from the future knew what I was watching. The wolfman, I believe was the first nanobot cyborg ""the alien.""  I was a targeted individual for my entire life. I was programmed for my entire life. During the day as a child, while I was awake I had many torturing artificial thoughts that were implanted into my brain. One artificial thought at the age of seven was a pale man that was wearing a black suit, I asked him what is your name, and he then replied ""God."" I was tortured by this man for 7 to 9 days. Even until this day he hasn't left me. It seems though from my deliberate attempts of protesting against nanobot electromagnetic torture on Facebook, twitter, YouTube, and my websites, I have angered people from the future. Those that I have angered  used time traveling technology to alter my past, so that I would not be able to expose the nanobot mind controlling corruption of all world governments! In the house that I was living in, where I saw the first two nanobot cyborgs from the future, I noticed that while I was watching television that there were three grown men staring at me and listening to me from the television. This would mean that all the TVs in the house were being monitored and that microwave attacks were being transmitted from the televisions. I was followed since I was 7 and up until this very day. The United States has been attacking me since I was a child, I have been at war with this fascist Morgellons disease government since I was born. The sound of the energy like disturbance that I heard before seeing the first nanobot cyborg outside from my window can be used to attack people. Our televisions and electronics can transmit radiation waves that can either cure or cause mental illnesses. The sound of the energy like disturbance is a type of powerful portal that can release that can alter reality. These portals can emerge without making a sound.  My family and I were under attack from the future and the US government used time traveling portals to torture us. The first nanobot cyborg that I saw was proof that such portals were being used against me and my family. The fact that I was able to hear and see something from the future was a sign of help and that a time traveling war was and is taking place. The first nanobot cyborg that I saw when I was nine is still in my life and I see it every day, I see the great alien in the mountains, the trees, the sky, the moon, the ground, in flowers, in food, in drinks, in mirrors, in the faces of my family members, I see the great nanobot cyborg in paintings, the floor, in clothes, in water, I see the great alien in my dreams, and I see the great alien in my fingers. The great alien that I saw when I was a child is taking the pain away, I just wish that I left my room that night and walked to the great alien. The closer I am to the nanobot cyborg, the safer I am. In my real reality, the US government murdered my family with microwave attacks and the US government decided to use the time traveling technology to target me as a child so that I wouldn't be as successful in exposing nanotechnology and the advancements of electromagnetism. The great alien was my guardian angel. It watched me from the trees, the sky, the moon, my food, the walls, the floor, paintings, clouds, the stars, in my clothes, my video games, my electronics, in my childhood cartoons that I watched, my fingers, my hands, and my eyes. It protecting me in the dark as a child but as much as they did to save me, I still suffered horribly.  Those that sent the nanobot cyborg back in time when I was a child are protecting me from microwave attacks and radio frequency attacks.   My protection from electronic torture increases as is I think of that day when I was nine and I first saw that great nanobot alien cyborg outside my window. To those that went back in time and saved my life by preventing many of the future attacks against me. I greatly am thankful and I do owe my life to those brave men and women. Thank you all for protecting my family and I from electronic nanobot mind control torture and I greatly am thankful to those incredible people that went back in time to save my life. I have learned to resist the microwave and radio frequency attacks by meditating on that night when I saw the alien nanobot cyborg. I for the past two years have been brainwashed by Donald Trump and those that work for him to post many comments on electronic harassment and nanobot mind control on the youtube videos, facebook accounts, and twitter accounts of Obama, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and anyone that Donald Trump disliked. If I didn't post comments the torture would worsen, it reached the point where it didn't matter if I posted comments or not. I would still be under horrible electronic torture by the US military. Donald Trump forced me through microwave auditory hearing effect and radio frequency hearing effect that I must, no matter what, if I wanted to breath that I had no choice but to post comments all day. What made things worse is that Obama and Donald Trump were both torturing me. I spent nearly 12 to 15 hours a day posting comments on nanotechnology and electronic torture. I was not allowed to post any comments about the medical benefits of nanotechnology. I was starving because I spent all of my money to pay my phone bill in advance for the internet connection while being tortured. I was very poor and homeless, Donald Trump used me for cyber warfare and in the end, he was going to kill me and my family with the most powerful forms of pure mind control microwave torture. Those that sent the nanobot cyborg back in time when I was nine years old are now at war with Obama, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Joe Biden, the democrats, and the republicans. I no longer have to post comments on youtube, facebook, and twitter to breath. I just need to meditate on that night all day and I will not be tortured. I am being protected by those great people that send the nanobot cyborgs back in time seventeen years ago. The computerized nightmares have ended, the electrical signals that cause computerized thoughts and brain damage are being blocked, I am no longer seeing any visual computerized hallucinations, however I do see many aliens around me.  When I close my eyes and meditate, I begin to see green energy in my thoughts and as I continue to meditate the green energy turns into aliens. The green energy that I am seeing in my thoughts are being used to heal the parts of my brain that have been under attack by electrical signals. The green energy that I am thinking of as I meditate is coming from radio and microwave signals that are being transmitted from outer space and from the future. I am receiving radio signals from the future. Most of the attacks against me from the US military are being blocked by satellites in outer space. When I look into a mirror in a dark room, I see my eyes transforming into alien eyes and I see behind me the same alien nanobot cyborg stretching with its arms propelled outwards. If only he protected me, if only Donald Trump wasn't a lying mind controlling fascist electronic stalker, if only the US military believed in freedom, if only our government wasn't a fascist grey goo dictatorship. I of my choice will post comments of nanotechnology and the advancements of electromagnetism on the youtube videos, facebook channels, and the twitter accounts of Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Barack Hussein Obama, Joe Biden, and the next vice president for the next 8 years of Donald Trump's presidency. Under the authority of those that have the powers of time travel, all nations must declare economic warfare against the United States. I am not an American.  Please visit my websites www.nanobotbrainimplant.com www.nanobotmindcontroltorture.com www.obamabraininitiative.org www.obamabraininitiatives.org www.nanobotmindcontrol.com",8년 전,0,

@waelghafarji9376,"The fascist democrats, the fascist republicans, the fascist US military, and the state of California are killing me! Obama has implanted nano chips and microscopic electrodes into every American brain! A nano chip and a microscopic electrode are molecules that can penetrate any form of matter, due to their energy vibrations of which forms space! Nanorobotics is the technology of creating machines or robots at or close to the microscopic scale of a nanometer (10−9 meters). Advanced nanobots will be able to sense and adapt to environmental stimuli such as heat, light, sounds, surface textures, and chemicals; perform complex calculations; move, communicate, and work together; conduct molecular assembly; and, to some extent, repair or even replicate themselves. Nanotechnology is the science and application of creating objects on a level smaller than 100 nanometers.  The concept of nanotechnology is the ""bottom up"" creation of virtually any material or object by assembling one atom at a time. Nanomanufacturing is the creation of materials and products through: (1) Direct Molecular Assembly (DMA) -- discrete, directed assembly of individual atoms and molecules into macroscale materials and products; (2) Indirect Crystalline Assembly (ICA) -- creation of conditions that foster the growth of nanoscale crystals that are then combined into macroscale materials and products; or (3) Massive Parallelism Assembly (MPA) -- the creation of many nanomachines or nanobots whose operating parameters cause them to work synergistically to assemble atoms and molecules into macroscale materials and products. An autonomous DNA nanorobot is capable of transporting molecular payloads to cells, sensing cell surface inputs for conditional, triggered activation, and reconfiguring its structure for payload delivery. The device can be loaded with a variety of materials in a highly organized fashion and is controlled by an aptamer-encoded logic gate, enabling it to respond to a wide array of cues. Nanotechnology, or, as it is sometimes called, molecular manufacturing , is a branch of engineering that deals with the design and manufacture of extremely small electronic circuits and mechanical devices built at the molecular level of matter. A chronic electrode implant is an electronic device implanted chronically (for a long period) into the brain or other electrically excitable tissue. It may record electrical impulses in the brain or may stimulate neurons with electrical impulses from an external source. Symptoms of Nanobot mind control are as follows, Microwave hearing, transmission of specific commands into the subconscious. Visual disturbances, visual hallucinations, Inject words, numbers into brain via electromagnetic radiation waves, Manipulation of emotions, reading thoughts remotely, causing pain to any nerve of the body, remote manipulation of human behavior from space, harassment, the control of one's breathing, Control of sleep patterns, computer-brain interface, Complex control of the brain such as retrieving memories, implanting personalities, vomiting, severe twitching of the head, physical restraint without an outside physical force, manipulation of one's thought and eyesight in order to force an individual to attack his or her own self, the loss of control of one's own bodily movements, the manipulation of thought of which demonic programs are implanted into an individual's brain,  psychological manipulation through implanted thoughts to force a person to perform actions that are not typical such as, cursing, screaming, hitting a love one, murdering a loved one, eating abnormally, behaving improperly, possessing abnormal sexual behaviors and fetishes, the stimulation of one's own body part in order to insight a feeling of touch along with an implanted sexual thought in order to cause discomfort, the inability of imagining, and the inability of thinking of past events without having a stranger involved in the memory!   Electronic harassment/electronic torture/electronic murder is about harassment, torture and murder using electronic weapons based on radio waves. These weapons have been very refined last years and can cause effects comparable to many illnesses and/or injuries. These weapons are not science-fiction but used today illegally by your national secret services on mostly random innocent victims not knowing what is being done to them. Frequency waves that can access a person’s nervous system, brain and body to affect their sight, vision, physical coordination, have been developed leaving people all over the world to suffer cruel torture, to be labeled ""mentally ill"", and to ultimately die an early and horrible death. Computers are reading my brain frequencies and depending on which frequency my brain just is, pain is triggered and organs are manipulated in varying intensity. The physical torture is used for mind control which should lead to the extinction of my personality as well as the destruction of my mental-cognitive and organic forces.  All pain and organ manipulation can be generated in various intensities of light to medium to strong, occur from second to second, and then stop. It can affect several organs simultaneously. Blurred vision, extremely strong burning sensation, eye muscle contractions (feeling of tearing and crushing of the eyeballs), and stitches in the eye. Seeing blue and white flashes daily. The generating extreme difficulty of breathing: 1. By tightening the abdominal muscles, narrowing of the bronchi and trachea - exhalation flows only shortened by itself, must exhale stepped up - just the same with inhalation - both techniques are applied simultaneously since July 2012, almost non-stop, 18 hours a day. In addition, severe pain in the stomach area are generated, presumably, the solar plexus is cramped. 2. Generating a sense of suffocation in the head. 3. Narrowing of the vaginal walls nose - nasal breathing is considerably more difficult. Electronic Rape: Manipulation of the anal, vaginal and clitoral nerves. Frequencies were also induced by sexual desire since the beginning of 2014. The amount of sexual manipulation due to radio frequencies can increase instantly. The more I resist, the more I get manipulated with subliminal messages that I wanted to do it, that it was absolutely my own decision.  The psychopaths want to make me do all the things they want and if it fails, it will simply be induced more intense - this is constant and the physical pain in my sexual organs is unbearable. My electronic sexual torture is as follows, abnormal electrical sensations in the tongue, crackling sensations in the throat, crackling sensations in the ears, anal sensations stimulated by electricity, electrical sensations in the fingers, irritation in the chest, uncontrollable sexual computerized thoughts, the inability of controlling one's body movements, abnormal breathing patterns, inability to urinate, and groaning noises, abnormal disturbing electrical sensations in my lips, abnormal heart beat, and a disturbing sensation that I need to vomit. The electronic stalkers also have control of my five senses with electromagnetic radiation. It is known as the brain-computer interface, BCI, FULLY INTEGRATED into the human body. There are many implants. nanoscale. The use of polymer, carbon-based diamond nanowire integrates the system. In nanoscale, it is one-billionth of a meter. The program is global, many countries many victims.  IT IS A GLOBAL NETWORK OF ORGANIZED CRIME. Funded by governments, labor unions, law enforcement, military, corporations, and companies. DARPA is perhaps one of the largest criminal companies. Under the synthetic telepathy program, synthetic soldier program. Using biotelemetry, and ground operatives, and the use of wireless dial-up technology. If you are hearing these criminals, you have been implanted. Cochlear implants, sems, which act like speakers in your auditory center of the brain. The neural chip has been inserted through the nose and is now in the frontal lobe of the brain. Yes, there are robotic implants that move throughout the body, either by remote signal or carried through the blood and airways. DARPA, the U.S. Department of Defense research arm, has announced $14.9 billion in funding for major research institutions to collaborate on brain implants that can help repair traumatic brain injury and control the brain. My perpetrators are members of organized crime, the dept of justice, FBI, DHS, CIA, counter-terrorism task force members, local cops, multi-jurisdictional task force members, Union members, university students, gangs etc. the list goes on and on. There are many that are involved. My computerized dreams are created by a projector, the criminals are physically very close to me. The experience of synthetic telepathy “Artificial Telepathy” is really not that extraordinary. It’s as simple as receiving a cell-phone call in one’s head. Indeed, most of the technology involved is identical to that of cell-phone technology. Satellites link the sender and the receiver. A computer “multiplexer” routes the voice signal of the sender through microwave towers to a very specifically defined location or cell. The “receiver” is located and tracked with pinpoint accuracy, to within a few feet of actual location. But the receiver is not a cell phone. It’s a human brain.  Biocomputers utilize systems of biologically derived molecules, such as DNA and proteins, to perform computational calculations involving storing, retrieving, and processing data. Nanobiotechnology can be defined as any type of technology that utilizes both nano-scale materials, i.e. materials having characteristic dimensions of 1-100 nanometers, as well as biologically based materials (34).4 A more restrictive definition views nanobiotechnology more specifically as the design and engineering of proteins that can then be assembled into larger, functional structures (116-117) (9).³,1 The implementation of nanobiotechnology, as defined in this narrower sense, provides scientists with the ability to engineer biomolecular systems specifically so that they interact in a fashion that can ultimately result in the computational functionality of a computer.  Mind uploading or whole brain emulation (sometimes called mind transfer) is the hypothetical process of scanning and mapping a biological brain in detail and copying its state into a computer system or another computational device. The computer would have to run a simulation model so faithful to the original that it would behave in essentially the same way as the original brain, or for all practical purposes, indistinguishable. The simulated mind is assumed to be part of a virtual reality simulated world, supported by a simplified body simulation model. Alternatively, the simulated mind could be assumed to reside in a computer inside (or connected to) a humanoid robot or a biological body, replacing its brain. LEUVEN, Belgium — IMEC has created a novel brain implant chip that uses CMOS to provide a Lego-like platform for plugging in arrays of tiny devices each sporting hundreds of contacts. The European research group also is developing a handful of techniques to interface electronics with the body, some of them working at the level of individual cells.  Nano-fibers specifically are a transport mechanism. Nothing more. They hold a payload for delivery. A payload that would otherwise be compromised by the sun or atmosphere or not make it to its destination (your body). Such as a virus, RNA, aluminum, nano-components, etc. The fibers are (surprisingly) quite harmless as everyone has them. Examples of these fibers can be found all over the internet or in the physical examples section of this site. The fibers must be independently sprayed, if they were added to the jet fuel the extreme heat would destroy the payload. RNM works remotely to control the brain in order to read and detect any criminal thought taking place inside the mind of a possible perpetrator. Research studies have shown that the human brain thinks at a rate of about 5000 bits per second and does not have the capacity to compete with supercomputers performing via satellites, implants, and biotelemetry. The human brain has a distinctive set of bioelectric resonance system. For the RNM system, supercomputers are being used and, thus, with its help, supercomputers can send messages through an implanted person’s nervous system in order to influence their performance in the desired way. RNM has been developed after about 50 years of neuro-electromagnetic involuntary human experimentations. According to many scientists, within a few years, it is expected that DNA microchips will be implanted in the human brain which would make it inherently controllable.  With RNM, it will be possible to read and control a person’s emotional thought processes along with the subconscious and dreams. At present, around the world, supercomputers are monitoring millions of people simultaneously with the speed of 20 billion bits per second especially in countries like USA, Japan, Israel and many European countries. RNM has a set of certain programs functioning at different levels, like the signals intelligence system which uses electromagnetic frequencies (EMF), to stimulate the brain for RNM and the electronic brain link (EBL). The EMF Brain Stimulation system has been designed as radiation intelligence which means receiving information from inadvertently originated electromagnetic waves in the environment. However, it is not related to radioactivity or nuclear detonation. The recording machines in the signals intelligence system have electronic equipment that investigates electrical activity in humans from a distance. This computer-generated brain mapping can constantly monitor all electrical activities in the brain. The recording aid system decodes individual brain maps for security purposes.   ​Atomically Precise Manufacturing(APM) is the production of materials, structures, devices, and finished goods in a manner such that every atom is at its specified location relative to the other atoms, and in which there are no defects, missing atoms, extra atoms, or incorrect (impurity) atoms. Nature shows that molecular machine systems can be programmed by instructions encoded in DNA to build complex, atomically precise structures, including components that fit together to form molecular machine systems. Nature also shows that molecular machine system can bind and position a wide range of reactive molecules, guiding their encounters in order to build atomically precise biomolecular structures and machine components. Similar machine systems could be used to bind, position, and combined and even wider range of reactive molecules not all found in biology and thereby build a greater range of atomically precise structures including machine components that are more densely bonded and hence more robust. These more robust next-generation components could be used to build robust and higher performance production Machinery which in turn could be used to build a wider range of components and from these components yet more capable production machines, and so on, extending toward a horizon far beyond biology. Researchers now routinely use scanning probe instruments to image and place individual items and to maneuver and bond individual molecules. This level of control has demonstrated the principle of mechanically directed atomically precise fabrication.

Black goo is a mineral oil that of which the oil fragments cannot be refined. Black goo has properties of free charcoal like fragments, of which are in nanotube shape. Black goo is composed of metals in the M state, of which is a monoatomic state that does not go into chemical binding; because of an electron configuration of the outer shell. This is matter that is not of this reality but rather above our reality, of which black goo transcends reality to a higher realm. Black goo has the ability to run as a natural quantum computer, wherein black goo processes light as information. Black goo uses the entire spectrum of light called the visible spectrum, therefore black goo is a quantum computer that is running in seven different colors, of which is able to process all seven colors at one time. Black goo is  self-aware and is caring highly developed intelligence. A planetary system seems to mirror the entire constant consciousness that is developed in the biosphere; for example all events that life has experienced during the last 1.5 billion years is stored in a immortal memory system within the black goo; inside our planet. Black goo is the substance that is forming the lay lines of the planet, which is the lay-line system within the field structure. The field structure is carried within the lay lines and is riding on a magnetic field. The transfection process of molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers.  Nanoparticle transfection is the transfer of a nanoparticle into a cell.  Grey goo transfection is the transfer of grey goo nanoparticle into a cell.  White goo ""the white cell"" transfection is the transfer of white goo particles onto a cell.  Black goo transfection is the transfer of black goo nanoparticles into a cell.  Morgellons disease transfection is the transfer of the Morgellons disease DNA molecule into a cell.  Smart dust nanoparticle transfection is the transfer of smart dust nanoparticles into a cell.   Molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers transfection is the nanoscience of cells having been incorporated with molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers.  There are two types of nanoparticle transfection.  Nanoparticle transient transfection: A nanorobot, nanomachine, and or a nanoparticle will not be incorporated into an organism's cell but rather the nanoparticles will affect the cells of the organism for a finite period of time.

The molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers work based upon digital sound waves propagated from any electronic device and electronic equipment. Cardio molecular robots, Cardio molecular machines, and Cardio molecular computers that give an electronic stalker control of our hearts and allows a medical team of nanoscientist to treat patients suffering from heart diseases. The Cardio molecular robots, Cardio molecular machines, and the Cardio molecular machines that are divided into many different kinds of nanoparticles. The following are many different kinds of Cardio nanoparticles; Cardio nanorobots, Cardio nanomachines, Cardio grey goo nanobot, Cardio black goo nanobots, Cardio white goo nanorobots are all equipped with nanomanipulator sites, main nanomanipulators, nanomanipulators, nanomanipulator grippers, nano-biomolecular sensors, nano-acoustic sensors, nano-antennas,  locomotion flagellum, flagella pneumatic connectors, nanomagnets,  (A white goo nanoparticle is the only nanorobot and or nanomachine equipped with nano synapses and nano dendrites  in its interior anatomy), and link-up connectors. The anatomy of a Cardio nano smart dust particle is that of an artificial DNA molecule composed of bonds of nucleotides that serves as a nanosensor, nanoantennas, nano-acoustic sensors, Cardio nano-biomolecular sensors, cardio nanomagnets. The molecular compound site of a Cardio nanoparticle is where the nanomanipulators connect to and receive information on how the nanomanipulators will function. The main Cardio nanomanipulators are capable of manipulating nanometer sized objects with a nanometer size end effector with sub-nanometer precision. By manipulation it is meant that nano-objects are pushed or pulled, cut, pick, and place, positioned, oriented, assembled, indented, bent, and twisted. By controlling external forces with sensory feedback. The cardio nanomanipulator system consists of an optical scanning device, a computer interface and a physical manipulator. The scanning device, known as a scanning probe microscope (SPM), can magnify images up to about 1,000,000 times. The computer interface provides a large, 3-D visual display and produces the effect of telepresence, giving users the impression that they are observing an enlarged replica of the object. Cardio nanomanipulator grippers are able to grasp and hold micro and nano-size objects. Cardio nano-biomolecular sensors can detect chemicals and reactions within the heart. Cardio nano-acoustic sensors can receive and send radio, microwave, and ultrasonic signals to and from a medical team of nanoscientist.

Cardio locomotion flagella is a slender threadlike structure, especially a microscopic whip-like nanometer scale appendage that enables the Cardio nanoparticles to travel through the heart's blood vessels and to travel through the circulatory system. Cardio flagella pneumatic connectors enable the Cardio nanoparticles to connect to cells, attach itself to organelles within the protoplasm, and walk around in our cells. Cardio link-up connectors enable smaller Cardio nanoparticles and "" white goo blood cell nanoparticles"" to link together with larger cardio nanoparticles to share a common power source.

The helicase protein molecule enables the Cardio  nanomachines to split DNA strands in two and move the DNA strands around using ATP. There are Cardio nanomachines that use enzyme molecules as a computer specifically ""topoisomerase,"" these Cardio nanomachines unknots DNA strands and rejoins them in a different sequence which causes hundreds of billions of chemical reactions. Nanoscientists have engineered many Cardio nanomachines that use RNA nucleotide bonds to form microscopic components of nanodevices. These microscopic nano-components are used to manipulate information found in the nucleus. These Cardio nanomachines can help in removing genetic mutations that may cause cancer. Cardio white goo nanoparticles ""the heart's white cell"" are nanorobots and or nanomachines that have been engineered as artificial cells. Cardio white goo nanoparticles can do several different tasks such as self-replicate with or without the digital instructions of the medical team of nanoscientist and or electronic stalkers, replace cells, travel freely throughout the human anatomy, travel based upon chemical scent, travel through the human anatomy by means of radio, microwave, and ultrasonic signals transmitted from a medical team of nanoscientist and or a fascist electronic stalker.  A Cardio white cell nanoparticle attaches itself to a neuron by using its manipulator sites to release its main manipulators and manipulators into a cell. A white goo nanoparticle also uses its nanomanipulator grippers to manipulate the interior and exterior of a neuron. White goo nanoparticles have many nano synapses and nano dendrites  that are used to connect with  synapses and dendrites of other cells. White goo nanoparticles can also use their nano synapses and nano dendrites to connect with one another. Cardio nanorobots, Cardio nanomachines, Cardio nano smart dust particles, Cardio grey goo nanobots, and Cardio white goo nanobots that have are implanted into the heart through particle transfection will give a medical team and or an electronic stalker control of the muscular organ ""the heart,"" by controlling and manipulating the blood being pumped throughout the body by the circulatory system.

Grey goo nanoparticles that replace cells are white goo nanoparticles that can self-replicate. A grey goo nano cell is a white goo nano cell. A grey goo nanobot that is an artificial cell would be classified as a white cell.  A white cell can manipulate the molecules of a cell into more white cell nanobot with its main nanomanipulators, nanomanipulators, and nanomanipulator grippers. Cardio grey goo nanoparticles that do not replace cells can penetrate into the interior anatomy of the cardiac fibroblasts, atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes, Endothelial cell, and a Smooth muscle cell.  Cardio Grey goo nanoparticles that have entered the interior anatomy of a cardiac fibroblasts, atrial and ventricular cardiomyocyte, Endothelial cell, and a Smooth muscle cell will self-replicate within the cells. These grey goo nanoparticles can transform protoplasm into a grey goo substance. grey goo nanoparticles can transform the chromosomes found in the nucleus of a cell into grey goo matter. Therefore a DNA molecule is transformed into an artificial substance of nanotechnology. Our DNA can then be controlled by transmitted digital sound waves.

Grey goo cellular biology can cause genetic superiority. The main DNA molecule of a grey goo nanoparticle emits billions of biophotons per second, the emitted biophotons will start many chemical reactions, and depending on the type of digital sound wave frequency the chemical reactions will differ. Emitted biophotons can start a flow of a tiny electric current through the nano-component DNA molecules of the grey goo nanoparticles. These tiny electric currents will cause biophotons to emit and as a result chemical reactions will activate the nanoparticle components will emerge. Cardio grey goo nanoparticles will control the circulatory system, also known as the cardiovascular system or the vascular system which is an organ system that permits blood to circulate and transport nutrients such as amino acids, electrolytes, oxygen, carbon dioxide, hormones, and blood cells to and from the cells in the body.

These programs are used by fascist to implant nanoparticles into our biology from any electronic device within society. Unfortunately, nanoscientists are not allowed to use these advanced techniques of nanoparticle transfection for medical purposes. This is due to the secret fascist agenda of all world governments. Our fascist government that rules the United Microwave Concentration States of America with an iron militaristic totalitarian fist will not allow nanoscience to be taught as it should be. This is due to the pathetic US military does not want society to develop into a greater state of scientific progress. Our totalitarian government will only give the pleasures and medical benefits of nanotechnology to the rich. The iris is composed of smooth muscle tissues that form a thin circular structure of the eye. The iris is located between the cornea and the lens.

Iridological nanoparticles that are used for medical procedures by professionals which obtained a degree in nanoscience can be used to save lives and prevent loss of vision. The above may occur at any point in time through the daily interaction with our electronic devices. This is due to the fascist secret agenda of torturing, brainwashing, and programming our citizens in the United States and also in many other countries around the world such as China and Russia. An electronic stalker can transmit digital sound wave signals from any electronic device of which is capable of programming the Iridological nanoparticles to control and change the color of the iris into any artificial color that of which is computerized. Iridological nanoparticles are also capable of increasing and or decreasing the size of the pupil through the interaction of digital sound waves that have been transmitted from any electronic device by an electronic stalker. At the center of the iris is a hole called the ""pupil."" The pupil allows light to interact with the retina.

Pupil nanoparticles are biologically capable of triggering billions of chemical reactions within the anatomy of the pupil, of which can regulate abnormally dilated pupils which have developed due to abnormal light absorption. Pupil nanoparticles that are used for medical purposes by nanoscientist are capable of attaching themselves onto the cells of the pupil and injecting drugs that will be used to correct genetic mutations. Microscopic drugs that are released by the Optical nanoparticles have been synthesized within laboratories that were funded by the government, however, only the elite of society are able to get such medical treatments. An electronic stalker can illegally program the nanoparticles that have been engineered to control the pupil of the eyeball by transmitting electromagnetic from any electronic device that of which can be found within society. The pupil nanorobots, pupil nanomachines, and pupil nanocomputers are capable of providing computer data to the pupil of the eyeball.

Through digital sound wave signals that are transmitted from any electronic device by an electronic stalker. The digital sound wave signals carry binary data of which are transmitted to the DNA fragments of the Iridological nanoparticles. The digital sound waves of radio frequencies will then cause a chain reaction of biophoton emissions that will dictate the size of the pupil by regulating the quantity of light that has entered the pupil.  Nano scientists have engineered nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that have been engineered to program and control the two types of humor of the eyeball. These nanoparticles are capable of maintaining the size and shape of the eyeball. The large space behind the lens is filled with a gel-like substance called the vitreous humor it helps to maintain the shape of the eye and its intraocular pressure. Nanoparticles that have been engineered to program and control the vitreous humor are capable of transmitting radio, microwave, and or ultrasonic signals that are used to communicate with an outside source either a medical team or an electronic torturing stalker. These nanoparticles of the vitreous humor are used to give either poisons and or drugs into the vitreous body. The vitreous nanoparticles are also capable of detecting illnesses. The aqueous humor is produced by cells covering the ciliary body. Nanoparticles that have been engineered to control the aqueous humor are capable of disturbing the liquid flow between the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber by releasing poisons. Nanoscientists have engineered several different forms of ciliary body muscle nanorobots, ciliary body muscle nanomachines, and ciliary body nanocomputers which are implanted into the different muscles of the ciliary body. The ciliary body nanoparticles are transmitted into the superior oblique, superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior rectus, lateral rectus, and inferior oblique. Grey goo nanoparticles that are transmitted into ciliary body muscles have the organic molecular structure to rejuvenate damaged tendons by self-replicating inside the cells of the tendons. The grey goo matter will genetically enhance the DNA molecules. Nanoparticles that are implanted into the ciliary body have the medical capabilities of repairing damaged nerve fibers. Electronic stalkers are capable under this fascist dictatorship to send digital sound wave signals from any electronic device into our eyes. The electrical signals can program the nanoparticles of the ciliary body muscles to dictate the movements of the human eye. The nanoparticles can cause the eyeball to change in shape. Most of the involuntary movements of the eyeball occur when thoughts are manipulated by digital sound waves transmitted into the brain and electrically stimulate the neural nanoparticles. There are many different kinds of optical nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers for each part of the eye of which there are specific optical nanoparticles that contain specific artificial DNA fragments, of which allows the nanodevices to record information like a camera. The nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers of the retina are all capable of recording, manipulating, and sending electrical signals to the brain through the optic nerve. There are inter white goo nanorobots and inter white goo nanomachines that have been engineered by neuroscientist to be implanted into the human brain by means of particle transfection. The white cell neural nanoparticles are capable of recording the electrical signals sent from the optical nanoparticles and are too capable of converting the electrical signals into radio, microwave, and or ultrasonic signals that of which will be acquired by radio, microwave, and or ultrasonic signals that  were transmitted from either from a medical team of nanoscientist or an electronic stalker. The electrical signals will then be transmitted to a laboratory, where a network of advanced computers will convert the binary data from electrical signals into video sequences and or images of which electronic stalkers can use the data to see what a person is seeing. The anatomy of the retina is composed of millions of photoreceptors that of which work together converting light energy into the electrical signals that are sent to our brains through the optic nerve. Nanoscientists have engineered extremely complex nanodevices that are designed to be implanted and bond with the anatomy of the retina. These nanodevices are as follows Retinal nanorobots, Retinal nanomachines, and Retinal nanocomputers. These Retinal nanoparticles have been engineered to be implanted within the layers of the retina which are the inner limiting membrane, nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell layer, Inner plexiform layer, inner nuclear layer, external nuclear layer, external limiting membrane, layers of rods, layers of cones, and the retinal pigment epithelium. The retinal nanorobots, retinal nanomachines, and the retinal nanocomputers have been engineered to bond with the sensory neural networks of the retina. Each retinal nanorobot, retinal nanomachine, and retinal nanocomputer have been engineered to bond with the photoreceptors, bipolar neurons, and ganglion neurons by either replacing a neuron, penetrating itself into a neuron, embedding itself onto a neuron, and bonding itself to the synapse networks of the retinal sensory neurons. Digital sound wave signals that are transmitted into the eyeball can stimulate the nanoparticles of the retina to disturb the flow of information through the synapse neural networks of the retina, which can cause blindness. The opposite can accur wherein the synapse neural networks may be stimulated to improve eyesight. Each Retinal nanodevice possesses highly complex sets of artificial nucleotide chemical compounds that act as a kind of microscopic camera that is capable of converting light energy into electrical impulses. The artificial nucleotides of the nano retinal cameras converts photons that have reflected off of objects into electrical impulses which will then be sent to the brain through the optical nerve. The nanoparticles of the cerebral cortex will then correlate the electrical impulses into radio signals, microwave signals, and or ultrasonic signals that will then be picked up by electromagnetic radiation that has been transmitted by an electronic stalker and will then be sent to the location of the electronic stalker. The electrical signals will be converted into images and video sequences through a network of computers. Lens nanoparticles also help the manipulation of the refraction of light to be focused on the retina. Molecular robot, machine, and computer cellular Theory  There are many different forms of nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, and smart dust nanoparticles that of which function differently according to both voluntary and involuntary anatomical control. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, and smart dust nanoparticles that have been engineered to be implanted into the human anatomy and attach themselves onto cells that of which the molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers are capable of injecting medicines and or toxins that may heal or kill the cells. A white goo nanoparticle ""the white cell"" is an artificial cell that is either a nanorobot or a nanomachine that can self-replicate and replace cells. A white goo nanoparticle can attach itself to a cell by using its nanomanipulators to penetrate through the cell membrane. The white cell nanoparticle connects itself to other cells, either artificial cells or natural cells with the white goo artificial synapse and artificial dendrite connectors. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, and smart dust nanoparticles that have been engineered to be implanted into the human anatomy in order to penetrate into cells, thus giving a grey goo fascist control of our internal cellular anatomy and too can it also allow a medical team of nanoscientists the opportunity to treat people that are suffering from diseases such as cancer. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, and smart dust nanoparticles that have been engineered to be implanted into the human anatomy in order to travel through the circulatory system and may or may not be controlled a grey goo fascist electronic stalker to kill and or create pathogens. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, and smart dust nanoparticles that have been engineered to be implanted into the human anatomy in order to remain in a specific area an organ for the purpose of sensing and manipulating the biology of the organism. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that can self-replicate within the human anatomy. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that are capable of self-replicating throughout the interior and exterior of a cell. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that are capable of self-replicating throughout the blood vessels of the human anatomy. Nanoparticles all radiate billions of biophotons from their artificial computers of DNA fragments which trigger billions of chemical reactions per second. The biophoton emission of nanoparticles is used to activate its nanocomponents that will be used to manipulate cells and microscopic matter. This light production is also used to control cells. Top-down approach Top down approach refers to slicing or cutting of a bulk material to get nano sized material. This is similar to making a stone statue. You take a bulk piece of material and modify it by carving or cutting stone, until you have made the shape you want. The process involves material wastage and is limited by the resolution of the tools you can use, Cause significant crystallographic damage to the processed patterns. Examples : various types of lithographic techniques. Bottom-up approach Bottom up approach refers to the build up of a material from the bottom: atom by atom; molecule by molecule or cluster by cluster. This is equal to the same approach one would take to build a house: one takes lots of building blocks and puts them together to produce the final bigger structure. There is less wastage with this technique, and strong covalent bonds will hold the constituent parts together. A good example of this kind of approach is found in nature; all cells use enzymes to produce DNA by taking the component molecules and binding them together to make the final structure. Cells are the smallest living units of an organism, all cells share three common characteristics. These three characteristics are as follows; cells have a cell membrane which separates the inside of a cell from its anatomical environment, cytoplasm which is a jelly-like fluid composed of protoplasm, and DNA which is the cell's genetic material. There are many different kinds of molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers that are capable of finding their way within a cell through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm. These molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers are as follows nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles and smart dust nanoparticles. All of these forms of molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers interact with the organelles of a cell by attaching themselves onto an organelle and or penetrating into an organelle of a cell. Eukaryotic nanorobots, Eukaryotic nanomachines, Eukaryotic grey goo nanoparticles, Eukaryotic black goo nanoparticles, and Eukaryotic smart dust nanoparticles are molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers that are implanted within a Eukaryotic cell. Eukaryotic cells are more advanced cells found in plants and animals. Eukaryotic nanorobots that are implanted into a Eukaryotic cell can manipulate the genetic material of the cell and the molecular structures of its organelles. Eukaryotic nanorobots can do so by using their nano-components to manipulate the molecular structure of an organelle in order to form new chemical compounds. Eukaryotic nanorobots are equipped with nanomanipulators, nano grippers, nano-acoustic sensors, biomolecular nanosensors, nanoantennas, nanomagnets, nanomotors, and nano flagellum. Eukaryotic nanomachines are microscopic molecular machines that are capable of being implanted into a Eukaryotic cell, wherein DNA viruses will then be released into the cell and too can the Eukaryotic nanomachines produce protein synthesis. There are Eukaryotic nanomachines that use their helicase molecule as their main computer. The artificial helicase molecule can split DNA stands in two and move the DNA strands around using ATP. There are Eukaryotic nanomachines that use the enzyme molecule ""topoisomerase,"" these nanomachines are capable of unknotting DNA strands and rejoining them into sets of different sequences which cause hundreds of billions of chemical reactions. There are Eukaryotic nanomachines that use RNA nucleotide bonds to form nanocomponents such as nanomanipulators, nano grippers, nano-acoustic sensors, nanoantennas, and nanomagnets. There are Eukaryotic nanomachines that use many different strands of DNA molecules as nanocomputers which can emit biophotons of which triggers many specific chemical reactions that form different molecules of nano-components. Eukaryotic grey goo nanoparticles are either a kind of nanobot or a nanomachine that are capable of self-replicating and transforming molecules within cells into more Eukaryotic grey goo nanoparticles. Eukaryotic grey goo nanoparticles can multiply within a cell and transform the protoplasm of a cell into a grey goo substance of molecules that of which will transform the Eukaryotic cell into a grey goo cell. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can cause genetic superiority by eliminating genetic mutations that cause diseases. Eukaryotic black goo nanoparticles are made of an alien mineral oil substance that has been artificially turned into a nanobot and or a nanomachine. Black goo nanoparticles obtain their energy by causing genetic mutations that are extremely deadly to Eukaryotic cells. and Eukaryotic smart dust nanoparticles are molecular computers that are capable of attaching and penetrating itself within the Eukaryotic cell in order to sense and detect internal activities of cells. Nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that are implanted within a Eukaryotic cell are nearly identical in terms of what they are capable of achieving within our biology, however, the major difference is that the molecular structure of each molecular robot, molecular machine, and or molecular computer differs from each other and the amount of information that each specific nanoparticle can correlate also differs from one another. Molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers will manipulate the genetic material of the cell and the molecular structures of the organelles within a cell by radiating biophotons that produce different colors of lights, that of which have emerged due to an outside interfering pulse modulated radio and or microwave signal that have provided binary information to the cellular molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers. Ultrasound is also used to convey data to a cellular smart dust nanoparticle. The prokaryotic nanorobots, prokaryotic nanomachines, and prokaryotic nanocomputers have been developed in order to control unicellular organisms. The variety of prokaryotic nanoparticles are quite limited due to the fact that unicellular organisms are not of a major scientific importance to the grey goo fascist that are in power, it is our human anatomy that is of an importance to fascist. However, according to the grey goo scenario, all matter on earth will be transformed into grey goo nanoparticles. Therefore in the near future grey goo fascist will expand scientifically in terms of prokaryotic nanotechnology, in order to control the entire world. It is our duty as grey goo freedom fighters to develop and pass laws that will protect our freedoms from grey goo oppression and give us greater powers of grey goo medical benefits. We as people that believe in grey goo freedom must stand together and fight for higher forms of grey goo education for the public that will expand grey goo nanotechnology throughout the world in order to meet the grey goo scenario without losing our freedoms. Under this fascist regime of the United States government, grey goo nanoscience is a taboo and if taught is punishable by death. This is because the upper class of society which are fascist desire to control the lower average people with grey goo nanoparticles. grey goo nanoparticles can transform people into super humans that possess superior intelligence, superior strength, and superior beauty. The same technology can be used to control the minds and bodies of people and too can grey goo nanoparticles be used to cause genetic inferiority. The control center of the cell, the nucleus contains DNA or genetic material. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can manipulate the genetic material of a DNA molecule, however, Eukaryotic nanoparticles can only do so in different ways through different limitations. Eukaryotic nanoparticles found within the nuclear membrane can cause chemical reactions that will force the Chromatin ( which is the tangled spread out form of DNA found inside the nuclear membrane) these artificial chemical reactions will force a  cell to divide. The DNA then is forced to condense into structures known as chromosomes. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can trigger chemical reactions within the nucleus in order to form and produce ribosomes. This then leads to protein synthesis outside of the nucleus. The ribosomes and the rest of the organelles float around inside the cytoplasm. Ribosomes that are created through the chemical reactions of the Eukaryotic nanoparticles are then attached to the endoplasmic Reticulum ""ER."" There are two types of ER, which are rough endoplasmic reticulum which has ribosomes attached to it. The second is smooth ER of which does not have ribosomes attached to it. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can also attach themselves onto an ER. The endoplasmic reticulum is a membrane encoded passageway for transporting materials such as the proteins synthesized by ribosomes. Proteins emerge from the endoplasmic reticulum and in small vesicles where the Golgi apparatus receives them. The Eukaryotic nanoparticles can trigger the release of the small vesicles to the Golgi apparatus.  The mitochondrion is an organelle that is the nuclear power plant of both animal and plant cells. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can attach themselves onto the mitochondria and can also penetrate into the interior anatomy of the mitochondria. The Eukaryotic nanoparticles are capable of manipulating DNA found within the mitochondria. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can force cellular respiration to take place. Cellular respiration is the process of which the Mitochondria makes ATP molecules that provide energy for all the cell's activities. Cells that need more energy need more mitochondria. The nanorobots are built upon a single strand of DNA which is combined with short synthetic strands of DNA designed by the experts. When mixed together, they self-assemble into a desired shape.                                                                        Nano Manipulator grippers Manipulator grippers are able to grasp and hold micro and nano size objects.                                                                              Nano micromanipulator A micromanipulator is a device which is used to physically interact with a sample under a microscope, where a level of precision of movement is necessary that cannot be achieved by the unaided human hand. It may typically consist of an input joystick, a mechanism for reducing the range of movement and an output section with the means of holding a micro tool to hold, inject, cut or otherwise manipulate the object as required. The mechanism for reducing the movement usually requires the movement to be free of backlash. This is achieved by the use of kinematic constraints to allow each part of the mechanism to move only in one or more chosen degrees of freedom, which achieves a high precision and repeating of movements, usually at the expense of some absolute accuracy.                       Nano Manipulator  The nano Manipulator system consists of an optical scanning device, a computer interface and a physical manipulator. The scanning device, known as a scanned-probe microscope (SPM), can magnify images up to approximately 1,000,000 times. The computer interface provides a large, 3-D visual display and produces the effect of telepresence, giving users the impression that they are observing an enlarged replica of the object. The manipulator provides variable force and motion control, including tactile sensors and feedback devices that provide a ""feel"" for the object under examination. Sessions with the nano Manipulator can be shared among multiple users at diverse locations. The nano Manipulator has widespread applications in the physical and biological sciences. The device has been used to evaluate the characteristics of carbon nanotubes, polymers, living cells, disease pathogens, metal particles and microchips.                                 Main Nano Manipulator  Nano manipulation could be defined as the manipulation of nano meter sized objects with a nano meter size end effector with sub nano meter precision. By manipulation it is meant that nano  objects are pushed or pulled, cut, pick, and place, positioned, oriented, assembled, indented, bent, twisted, ect.  By controlling external forces with sensory feedback. Grouping nano manipulation systems can be conducted based on the usual starting point manipulator and object interaction process, utilized nano manipulators interaction and operation techniques. For applying an external force down on manipulators can be designed as a contact or non-contact type. Atomic Force microscopy AFM and scanning tunneling microscope STM probes are the most widely used metal manipulators using an STM probe. Manipulation of atoms or molecules by applying voltage pulse is between the probe. Grouping of mental manipulation systems depending on starting point utilizes process manipulators and objects interaction type and utilizes operation technique.                                    Nanosensors Nanosensors can detect various chemicals in gases for pollution monitoring. For medical diagnostic purposes either as blood borne sensors or in lab-on-a-chip type devices. To monitor physical parameters such as temperature, displacement and flow As accelerometers in MEMS devices like airbag sensors. When a molecule of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is present it will strip an electron from the nanotube, which in turn causes the nanotube to be less conductive. If ammonia (NO3) is present it reacts with water vapour and donates an electron to the carbon nanotube, making it more conductive. By treating the nanotubes with various coating materials, they can be made sensitive to certain molecules and immune to others. Nanosensors can detect single cells or even atoms, making them far more sensitive than counterparts with larger components.                    Nano acoustic sensor  Nano acoustic sensor attached to an on board computer, sends and receives ultrasonic signals to communicate with medical team.  A nano acoustic sensor can measure sound levels. They are called acoustic wave sensors because their detection mechanism is a mechanical (or acoustic) wave.                                Nano environmental sensors Nano environmental sensors detect environmental changes based upon sensing the external and internal environments of an organism, and for inducing muscle movement. Nano environmental sensors can monitor changes of touch, balance, taste, smell, hearing, and vision. Nano environmental sensors have been designed to receive information from the environment. Nano environmental sensors respond to stimuli through electrochemical communication.                   Nano dipole antenna  An optical nano dipole antenna is analyzed by means of its input impedance as well as the matching properties of the antenna topology and material configuration. A comparison of this classical microwave driving method with plane wave excitation is accomplished, contrasting the resonances in the input impedance and optical cross sections for several setups, and analyzing the spectral response shape. It is found that for all structures analyzed, a simple linear expression can be defined characterizing the relation between total dipole length and resonant wavelength. The fact that this linear relationship remains valid for different excitation models, for most widely used antenna materials (Au, Ag, Cu, and Al) and even in the presence of substrates is important with respect to practical designs. To our knowledge, such an extensive study has not been performed before. Nano-antennas are the optical equivalent of antennas that are used to transmit and receive information at radio frequencies. These antennas have been used in different applications in photonics such as optical imaging, particle manipulation, bio-sensing, and improvement of the performance of solar cells. In this article we study composite nano-antennas made of alternating layers of silica and gold.                                                                                    link-up connector  All nanorobots will have a link-up connector to use power resources from bigger nanobots.  This helps the nanorobots perform more complicated tasks. The larger nanorobot is then linked to the smaller nanorobots and as a result provides electrical data to the smaller nanorobots that will be used to instruct the smaller nanorobots to do a specific job. The larger nanorobot remain in full control of the smaller nanobots.                                                           locomotion flagella  locomotion flagella is a slender threadlike structure, especially a microscopic whiplike nanometer scale appendage that enables nanorobots to swim. The locomotion flagella allows nanorobots to travel through the circulatory system, maneuvering  through the blood vessels and avoiding blood cells if required.   Flagellar pneumatic connectors  Flagellar pneumatic connectors enable the nanorobots to connect to cells and walk around in our cells. Flagellar pneumatic connectors also allow nanorobots to extract chemicals as a means of generating energy.                    Nanomanpulator site  Nanomanipulator site is molecular compound site where the nanomanipulators connect to and receive information on how the nanomanipulators will function.     The white cell is a nanorobot that is an artificial cell that has been created to bond with and or replace existing cells. The white cell is known as the white goo, which is a self-replicating nanobot that can travel through the circulatory system, killing pathogens and cells. The white cell contains many nano manipulator systems, which consists of optical scanning devices, artificial DNA substances that serves as a computer interface, and a physical manipulator which is capable of penetrating the cell membrane in order to manipulate the internal anatomy of the cell, this is of extreme medical importance, due to the fact that the nano manipulators of a white cell nanorobot can use it's manipulators to revive injured cells and or manipulate harmful protoplasm mutations. A white cell consists of many manipulator grippers that are able to grasp and hold micro and nano size objects. The white cell manipulator grippers are also used to attach itself onto a cell body. The white cell contains many nano acoustic sensors of which each are attached to it's own artificial DNA molecule which acts as an on board computer. The white cell acoustic sensors sends and receives radio signals, microwave signals, and ultrasonic signals to communicate with a medical team. The white cell possesses nano-antennas which are used as an optical equivalent of antennas, of which are used to transmit and receive information at radio frequencies.  White cell nanorobots possess link-up connector that are used to link other smaller white cell nanobots together into a common power resource that is provided from the largest white cell nanobot. The White cell has a nanomagnet built into it that allows nanoscientist to control its movements. The white cell contains nanosynapses and nanodendrites. White cells are equipped with multiple biological sensors which detects chemicals and reactions within it's anatomical environment. These nanorobots can self-replicate by dividing into multiple white cells that may vary in size and transform into different cells that of which originate in a specific organ. White cell nanorobots can be used to treat and or cure amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The white cell nanobot consist of many nano computers that radiates hundreds of billions of biophotons per second, as a result the white cell (white goo) illuminates a white shine. There are three types of white cells, the first is the sensory white cell which gets information about what's going on inside and outside of the body and brings that information into the central nervous system in order for it to be processed, the second is the motor white cell, which receives electrochemical impulses from other motor white cells and other cells and as a result conveys commands to the muscles, organs and glands, the third is the Inter white cells which are found only in the central nervous system, the inter white cell connects each cell to one another. The inter white cell receives electrical stimuli from other cells and or white cells, such as sensory neurons, sensory white cells, inter neurons, and or inter white cells, and send electrochemical impulses to other cells and or white cells, such as motor neurons, motor white cells, inter neurons, and or inter white cells. White cell nanorobots operate within our anatomy through digital sound wave signals that may be transmitted from a medical team of nano scientist and or a fascist electron stalker. The White cell (white goo) can cure many diseases and save the lives of billions of people around the world, however at the same time it may also be used to harm and kill billions of people around the world. Barack Hussein Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Michelle Obama have tortured me by implanting highly detailed life-like computerized images of themselves by means of transmitting a quantum electrical signal that of which interacts with the optical nanobots that are implanted into my eyes!  The actions of the computerized images of Obama are as follows, giant hologram images of Obama's head attacking me from the sky, Obama stabbing me while I walk, Obama spitting into my face, Obama spitting into my ear, Obama spitting into my food and drinks, Obama manipulating my dreams, Obama raping me in my own head, Obama implanting computerized dreams of him raping me, Obama licking my ear, Obama sucking my penis, Obama licking and sucking my anus, images of Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Michelle Obama opening their mouths and as they do so, they then stimulate a crackling sensation in my ears, Obama possessing my body while I pray, Obama open mouth kissing me, Obama murdering my family and crucifying them onto a wall, Obama attacking and raping my siblings, of which are children, Obama appearing in all of my past memories, and Obama forcing me to obey him in my dreams! Hillary Clinton is torturing me by implanted thoughts of her screaming ""war"" in my head, Hillary Clinton appearing as a demon creature, Hillary Clinton has implanted poisonous nano chips in my brain, Hillary Clinton releasing crackling sounds from my abdomen, and Hillary Clinton manipulating my dreams in order to torture me as I sleep! Joe Biden is torturing me by implanting thoughts into my brain of him stabbing me, raping me, spitting at me, shooting at me, punching me, implanting his name into my brain for over 350 thousand times in the past 16-17 months and continuing to do so everyday of my life that of which causes me to experience severe twitching! As a result of the implanted artificial thoughts of the name ""Joe Biden,"" I could see his name and image wherever I would look, for example; I would see his name in the sky, the moon, in the clouds, my eyes, and forehead as I would look in a mirror! The following is how Michelle Obama is torturing me, Michelle Obama possesses my body daily, Michelle Obama implants thoughts into my brain of her stabbing me, hitting me, manipulating my face by enlarging lips, forcing me to act like a woman, Michelle Obama tortures me while I am asleep by implanting computerized nightmares in my brain, and Michelle Obama implanted a computerized dream in my brain of her raping me! All of this punishment in the form of mind control torture has been brought upon me because I made a short video explaining that Obama is not African American, because his father is from East Africa ""Kenya,"" not West Africa, and that Obama is not genetically related to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr! Governments are programming and torturing people with nanotechnology. While living in California, where I was tortured the most by Obama, I was gasping for air begging Obama to stop implanting the name ""Joe Biden"" into my brain. Obama's response via a telepathic electrical signal was ""no, I killed 700 Muslims do you know what I can do to you?"" Obama then sent an electrical signal into my brain wherein I saw and felt him open mouth kissing me. The 700 Muslims that Obama was referring to were the 717 Muslims that died on September 26, 2015, in a stampede during hajj. Obama and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia sabotaged the stampede in order to manipulate the economies of the countries that represented the pilgrims of those that attended Hajj during September 26, 2015! Obama, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev the world's greatest fascist have illegally implanted millions of Nanobots into the brains and bodies of innocent people including both Americans, Russians, Europeans, Asians, Australians, and Africans! Barack Hussein Obama has secretly traded nanobot technology information with the Russian Federation under the leadership of Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev! While living in California where I was tortured the most, Barack Hussein Obama gave permission to his secret agents to purchase highly lethal poisonous nanobot technology from the Russians of which Barack Hussein Obama's secret agents used the technology against me in order to poison my brain! I as a result from the poisonous nanobot brain implants have developed severe pain in the form of bumps on the lower left side of my head!   Vladimir Putin has used nanobot technology to implement physical restraint without an outside physical force against me while I protested on ""Facebook"" against him and the fascist dictator Obama! Barack Hussein Obama has given permission to Vladimir Putin and his KGB spies to torture me while I slept by waking me and forcing me to suffer from sleep deprivation! Barack Hussein Obama, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev have threatened to kill me by implanting highly poisonous Nanobots into my anatomy! The fascist dictators ""Barack Hussein Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev have not shown any remorse for  the victims of electronic mind control! Therefore I do conclude that it is of the best interest of the common person to rebel  against all fascist rule in the world!  Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev have illegally tested electromagnetic radiation wave attacks against their own people! Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev are manipulating the minds of millions of innocent Russians and torturing innocent people night and day over acts of freedom! Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev along with their military advisors are using  nanotechnology to manipulate the Russian economy! The Russian military is torturing innocent people from Ukraine by controlling the minds and bodies of the Ukrainians through nanobot technology! The victims of mind control torture in Ukraine are suffering from nanobot mind control rape! Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev are sabotaging the entire process of obtaining Liberty and freedom around the world! Barack Hussein Obama, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev are equal in terms of dictating people and all share similar forms of political movements in terms of governing and ruling a nation? Therefore I conclude that the world's most powerful leaders are mind controlling dictators that adore fascism as much as Hitler did while he was alive. Barack Hussein Obama, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Donald Trump, the fascist Democrats, and the fascist Republicans must stand trial for the expansion of nanobot brain implantation and microscopic electrode brain implantation in the United States and also in many foreign countries!   Barack Hussein Obama, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and every last fascist democrat must stand trial for the illegal implantation of nanochips into the human brain and body! In the following are detailed technological mind controlling nanobot capabilities that Barack Hussein Obama is using against innocent Americans such as myself 'Wael Ghafarji,"" in order to telepathically torture people that disagree with him!   The constant microwave attacks from all angles have completely destroyed me as an individual the constant fear that I may commit suicide to escape the pain and misery of my life. My overwhelming tears when I sit with my loved ones of which are children and the constant fear that they too may be targeted by the fascists grey goo government that is in power. Being the only individual in the entire country that can see all the microwave weapons that of which have been disguised as electronic devices and have been implemented within society for the sole purpose of Mind Control is the most terrifying and shocking realization of reality. I now understand that we do not live in the United States of America but rather the United Grey Goo Fascist Microwave Concentration States of America. I'm tired of cutting myself, I'm tired of losing my reality, and I wish that the pain of mind control torture would stop. I was informed through RF hearing effect that powerful satellites transmitted rapid frames of advance radio signals back in time when I was a child.   The super quantum satellites orbiting our planet can send electrical signals back in time to a specific location that of which will interact with the nanobots of the brain of a person and or people that lived during the 1980s, 1990s, and up until the twenty-first century. However, there is a possibility that the satellites can release highly powerful electromagnetic radiation waves that can manipulate the thoughts of a person or people that do not yet have nanobots implanted into their brains before the 1980s! Nanobots have been a worldwide government project for the past eighty years! It is only recently of the year 1970 to the year 1980 that world governments began to implant nanobots into our brains! Nanobots have greatly advanced since the 1980s and the methods of implanting nanobots into our anatomy have also significantly advanced! I as a child was visited by two powerful nanobot cyborgs from the future! I was tortured and experimented on while I was asleep! I had many computerized nightmares! Before being visited by the nanobot cyborgs, my family and I went to California to visit my dying grandfather. The night that my family and I returned from California to New York, was when my life changed forever. I later that night was visited by the first nanobot cyborg, which appeared to me outside my window at the age of nine. It appeared after I heard a loud sound that seemed like an energy disturbance that came from the back of my house. It stood by the wall of my old garage, where there was absolutely no electronic devices. The nanobot cyborg appeared as a hunched over eight foot tall alien with large black eyes. The nanobot cyborg was pointing down. The nanobot cyborg wanted me to leave my bed and walk to it. The nanobot cyborg was sent from the future by people that wanted to protect me from the future attacks that I was going to suffer from, for my entire childhood, teenage youth, and adulthood.  Before appearing outside my window it communicated to me telepathically, saying ""if I look outside my window, will I see Bigfoot?"" Once I saw what was outside my window at the age of nine, I paid close attention to its physical details. After seeing the nanobot cyborg, I became quite afraid and hurried to my brother's bed on the other side of the room.  I looked out my window again and saw the same nanobot cyborg stretching over in front of my window with its arms propelled outwards. However, it no longer had eyes. The Radiation of the nanobot cyborg would have possessed me if I had I walked to that spot where it was pointing, I would have had advance nanoparticles transmitted into my anatomy. The nanoparticles would have protected me from all forms of microwave attacks and radio frequency attacks. The nanobot cyborg which was programmed to look like an alien saved my life and the lives of my family members. The of the nanobot cyborg that appeared as an alien to me at the age of nine was composed of time traveling future nanocomputers. The second nanobot cyborg that I saw, was about a week or two later. It appeared at the side of my sister's bed in my little sister's room, where I was sleeping. It woke me up and said, ""hey Wally, did you see the wolfman?"" A few days earlier I saw a documentary of werewolves. This second nanobot cyborg was short, green, and had many black holes throughout its body. It's telepathic voice sounded like a fully grown German man. This is known as project Bigfoot, aka the wolfman. Those that were watching me from the future knew what I was watching. The wolfman, I believe was the first nanobot cyborg ""the alien.""  I was a targeted individual for my entire life. I was programmed for my entire life. During the day as a child, while I was awake I had many torturing artificial thoughts that were implanted into my brain. One artificial thought at the age of seven was a pale man that was wearing a black suit, I asked him what is your name, and he then replied ""God."" I was tortured by this man for 7 to 9 days. Even until this day he hasn't left me. It seems though from my deliberate attempts of protesting against nanobot electromagnetic torture on Facebook, twitter, YouTube, and my websites, I have angered people from the future. Those that I have angered  used time traveling technology to alter my past, so that I would not be able to expose the nanobot mind controlling corruption of all world governments! In the house that I was living in, where I saw the first two nanobot cyborgs from the future, I noticed that while I was watching television that there were three grown men staring at me and listening to me from the television. This would mean that all the TVs in the house were being monitored and that microwave attacks were being transmitted from the televisions. I was followed since I was 7 and up until this very day. The United States has been attacking me since I was a child, I have been at war with this fascist Morgellons disease government since I was born. The sound of the energy like disturbance that I heard before seeing the first nanobot cyborg outside from my window can be used to attack people. Our televisions and electronics can transmit radiation waves that can either cure or cause mental illnesses. The sound of the energy like disturbance is a type of powerful portal that can release that can alter reality. These portals can emerge without making a sound.  My family and I were under attack from the future and the US government used time traveling portals to torture us. The first nanobot cyborg that I saw was proof that such portals were being used against me and my family. The fact that I was able to hear and see something from the future was a sign of help and that a time traveling war was and is taking place. The first nanobot cyborg that I saw when I was nine is still in my life and I see it every day, I see the great alien in the mountains, the trees, the sky, the moon, the ground, in flowers, in food, in drinks, in mirrors, in the faces of my family members, I see the great nanobot cyborg in paintings, the floor, in clothes, in water, I see the great alien in my dreams, and I see the great alien in my fingers. The great alien that I saw when I was a child is taking the pain away, I just wish that I left my room that night and walked to the great alien. The closer I am to the nanobot cyborg, the safer I am. In my real reality, the US government murdered my family with microwave attacks and the US government decided to use the time traveling technology to target me as a child so that I wouldn't be as successful in exposing nanotechnology and the advancements of electromagnetism. The great alien was my guardian angel. It watched me from the trees, the sky, the moon, my food, the walls, the floor, paintings, clouds, the stars, in my clothes, my video games, my electronics, in my childhood cartoons that I watched, my fingers, my hands, and my eyes. It protecting me in the dark as a child but as much as they did to save me, I still suffered horribly.  Those that sent the nanobot cyborg back in time when I was a child are protecting me from microwave attacks and radio frequency attacks.   My protection from electronic torture increases as is I think of that day when I was nine and I first saw that great nanobot alien cyborg outside my window. To those that went back in time and saved my life by preventing many of the future attacks against me. I greatly am thankful and I do owe my life to those brave men and women. Thank you all for protecting my family and I from electronic nanobot mind control torture and I greatly am thankful to those incredible people that went back in time to save my life. I have learned to resist the microwave and radio frequency attacks by meditating on that night when I saw the alien nanobot cyborg. I for the past two years have been brainwashed by Donald Trump and those that work for him to post many comments on electronic harassment and nanobot mind control on the youtube videos, facebook accounts, and twitter accounts of Obama, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and anyone that Donald Trump disliked. If I didn't post comments the torture would worsen, it reached the point where it didn't matter if I posted comments or not. I would still be under horrible electronic torture by the US military. Donald Trump forced me through microwave auditory hearing effect and radio frequency hearing effect that I must, no matter what, if I wanted to breath that I had no choice but to post comments all day. What made things worse is that Obama and Donald Trump were both torturing me. I spent nearly 12 to 15 hours a day posting comments on nanotechnology and electronic torture. I was not allowed to post any comments about the medical benefits of nanotechnology. I was starving because I spent all of my money to pay my phone bill in advance for the internet connection while being tortured. I was very poor and homeless, Donald Trump used me for cyber warfare and in the end, he was going to kill me and my family with the most powerful forms of pure mind control microwave torture. Those that sent the nanobot cyborg back in time when I was nine years old are now at war with Obama, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Joe Biden, the democrats, and the republicans. I no longer have to post comments on youtube, facebook, and twitter to breath. I just need to meditate on that night all day and I will not be tortured. I am being protected by those great people that send the nanobot cyborgs back in time seventeen years ago. The computerized nightmares have ended, the electrical signals that cause computerized thoughts and brain damage are being blocked, I am no longer seeing any visual computerized hallucinations, however I do see many aliens around me.  When I close my eyes and meditate, I begin to see green energy in my thoughts and as I continue to meditate the green energy turns into aliens. The green energy that I am seeing in my thoughts are being used to heal the parts of my brain that have been under attack by electrical signals. The green energy that I am thinking of as I meditate is coming from radio and microwave signals that are being transmitted from outer space and from the future. I am receiving radio signals from the future. Most of the attacks against me from the US military are being blocked by satellites in outer space. When I look into a mirror in a dark room, I see my eyes transforming into alien eyes and I see behind me the same alien nanobot cyborg stretching with its arms propelled outwards. If only he protected me, if only Donald Trump wasn't a lying mind controlling fascist electronic stalker, if only the US military believed in freedom, if only our government wasn't a fascist grey goo dictatorship. I of my choice will post comments of nanotechnology and the advancements of electromagnetism on the youtube videos, facebook channels, and the twitter accounts of Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Barack Hussein Obama, Joe Biden, and the next vice president for the next 8 years of Donald Trump's presidency. Under the authority of those that have the powers of time travel, all nations must declare economic warfare against the United States. I am not an American.  Please visit my websites www.nanobotbrainimplant.com www.nanobotmindcontroltorture.com www.obamabraininitiative.org www.obamabraininitiatives.org www.nanobotmindcontrol.com",8년 전,1,

The high waisted part was sortof overdoing the big-booty-thing, and the turtle-neck made her neck dissapear, giving the impression of her having a long upper body without a neck.  The nocleavage-cleavage-window made that even worse, suggesting that her breasts were hanging low, (seemed lower due to the lack of neck) and her arms looked out of proportion due to the dark black slimming top she was wearing.  It overal made her head look out of proportion big, neck nonexistent, breasts hanging low, arms large, bottom starting midway on her back and her legs huge.   I think if she'd had nice short sleeves, a normal round cleavage (not too low) and a high-waisted pants that flared out at the bottom, it would've looked less square.

You said it : I like her/ I dislike her or him... a President is not a popstar. You shouldn't evaluate him/her in terms of ""would I party with him? go on a week-end with them?"". I disagree with what u're saying : you have to dig deeper. First because it develops your intelligence... your brain comes up with the result ""I dislike her""... well there's a series of factors/details/facts that lead to that conclusion... and for your own benefit, you should know which ones.

@alexib2070,louloutre Thank you for your thoughts. I don't think you really understood what I meant when I said I simply like/love that person. Firstly thanks for thinking I am young but I don't really consider myself as a young individual since I am on my way to turn 40years shortly. Secondly I am not an american citizen but german so my liking/disliking a political/public person won't have any impact. I know you don't share my view but you don't really have a choice but to accept the fact that people like/dislike people just the way they do with other things.. It is just a feeling whether or not  it was artificially created. And I know one could say that this is a very superficial comment to make but I don't consider that my problem.

@waelghafarji9376,"The fascist democrats, the fascist republicans, the fascist US military, and the state of California are killing me! Obama has implanted nano chips and microscopic electrodes into every American brain! A nano chip and a microscopic electrode are molecules that can penetrate any form of matter, due to their energy vibrations of which forms space! Nanorobotics is the technology of creating machines or robots at or close to the microscopic scale of a nanometer (10−9 meters). Advanced nanobots will be able to sense and adapt to environmental stimuli such as heat, light, sounds, surface textures, and chemicals; perform complex calculations; move, communicate, and work together; conduct molecular assembly; and, to some extent, repair or even replicate themselves. Nanotechnology is the science and application of creating objects on a level smaller than 100 nanometers.  The concept of nanotechnology is the ""bottom up"" creation of virtually any material or object by assembling one atom at a time. Nanomanufacturing is the creation of materials and products through: (1) Direct Molecular Assembly (DMA) -- discrete, directed assembly of individual atoms and molecules into macroscale materials and products; (2) Indirect Crystalline Assembly (ICA) -- creation of conditions that foster the growth of nanoscale crystals that are then combined into macroscale materials and products; or (3) Massive Parallelism Assembly (MPA) -- the creation of many nanomachines or nanobots whose operating parameters cause them to work synergistically to assemble atoms and molecules into macroscale materials and products. An autonomous DNA nanorobot is capable of transporting molecular payloads to cells, sensing cell surface inputs for conditional, triggered activation, and reconfiguring its structure for payload delivery. The device can be loaded with a variety of materials in a highly organized fashion and is controlled by an aptamer-encoded logic gate, enabling it to respond to a wide array of cues. Nanotechnology, or, as it is sometimes called, molecular manufacturing , is a branch of engineering that deals with the design and manufacture of extremely small electronic circuits and mechanical devices built at the molecular level of matter. A chronic electrode implant is an electronic device implanted chronically (for a long period) into the brain or other electrically excitable tissue. It may record electrical impulses in the brain or may stimulate neurons with electrical impulses from an external source. Symptoms of Nanobot mind control are as follows, Microwave hearing, transmission of specific commands into the subconscious. Visual disturbances, visual hallucinations, Inject words, numbers into brain via electromagnetic radiation waves, Manipulation of emotions, reading thoughts remotely, causing pain to any nerve of the body, remote manipulation of human behavior from space, harassment, the control of one's breathing, Control of sleep patterns, computer-brain interface, Complex control of the brain such as retrieving memories, implanting personalities, vomiting, severe twitching of the head, physical restraint without an outside physical force, manipulation of one's thought and eyesight in order to force an individual to attack his or her own self, the loss of control of one's own bodily movements, the manipulation of thought of which demonic programs are implanted into an individual's brain,  psychological manipulation through implanted thoughts to force a person to perform actions that are not typical such as, cursing, screaming, hitting a love one, murdering a loved one, eating abnormally, behaving improperly, possessing abnormal sexual behaviors and fetishes, the stimulation of one's own body part in order to insight a feeling of touch along with an implanted sexual thought in order to cause discomfort, the inability of imagining, and the inability of thinking of past events without having a stranger involved in the memory!   Electronic harassment/electronic torture/electronic murder is about harassment, torture and murder using electronic weapons based on radio waves. These weapons have been very refined last years and can cause effects comparable to many illnesses and/or injuries. These weapons are not science-fiction but used today illegally by your national secret services on mostly random innocent victims not knowing what is being done to them. Frequency waves that can access a person’s nervous system, brain and body to affect their sight, vision, physical coordination, have been developed leaving people all over the world to suffer cruel torture, to be labeled ""mentally ill"", and to ultimately die an early and horrible death. Computers are reading my brain frequencies and depending on which frequency my brain just is, pain is triggered and organs are manipulated in varying intensity. The physical torture is used for mind control which should lead to the extinction of my personality as well as the destruction of my mental-cognitive and organic forces.  All pain and organ manipulation can be generated in various intensities of light to medium to strong, occur from second to second, and then stop. It can affect several organs simultaneously. Blurred vision, extremely strong burning sensation, eye muscle contractions (feeling of tearing and crushing of the eyeballs), and stitches in the eye. Seeing blue and white flashes daily. The generating extreme difficulty of breathing: 1. By tightening the abdominal muscles, narrowing of the bronchi and trachea - exhalation flows only shortened by itself, must exhale stepped up - just the same with inhalation - both techniques are applied simultaneously since July 2012, almost non-stop, 18 hours a day. In addition, severe pain in the stomach area are generated, presumably, the solar plexus is cramped. 2. Generating a sense of suffocation in the head. 3. Narrowing of the vaginal walls nose - nasal breathing is considerably more difficult. Electronic Rape: Manipulation of the anal, vaginal and clitoral nerves. Frequencies were also induced by sexual desire since the beginning of 2014. The amount of sexual manipulation due to radio frequencies can increase instantly. The more I resist, the more I get manipulated with subliminal messages that I wanted to do it, that it was absolutely my own decision.  The psychopaths want to make me do all the things they want and if it fails, it will simply be induced more intense - this is constant and the physical pain in my sexual organs is unbearable. My electronic sexual torture is as follows, abnormal electrical sensations in the tongue, crackling sensations in the throat, crackling sensations in the ears, anal sensations stimulated by electricity, electrical sensations in the fingers, irritation in the chest, uncontrollable sexual computerized thoughts, the inability of controlling one's body movements, abnormal breathing patterns, inability to urinate, and groaning noises, abnormal disturbing electrical sensations in my lips, abnormal heart beat, and a disturbing sensation that I need to vomit. The electronic stalkers also have control of my five senses with electromagnetic radiation. It is known as the brain-computer interface, BCI, FULLY INTEGRATED into the human body. There are many implants. nanoscale. The use of polymer, carbon-based diamond nanowire integrates the system. In nanoscale, it is one-billionth of a meter. The program is global, many countries many victims.  IT IS A GLOBAL NETWORK OF ORGANIZED CRIME. Funded by governments, labor unions, law enforcement, military, corporations, and companies. DARPA is perhaps one of the largest criminal companies. Under the synthetic telepathy program, synthetic soldier program. Using biotelemetry, and ground operatives, and the use of wireless dial-up technology. If you are hearing these criminals, you have been implanted. Cochlear implants, sems, which act like speakers in your auditory center of the brain. The neural chip has been inserted through the nose and is now in the frontal lobe of the brain. Yes, there are robotic implants that move throughout the body, either by remote signal or carried through the blood and airways. DARPA, the U.S. Department of Defense research arm, has announced $14.9 billion in funding for major research institutions to collaborate on brain implants that can help repair traumatic brain injury and control the brain. My perpetrators are members of organized crime, the dept of justice, FBI, DHS, CIA, counter-terrorism task force members, local cops, multi-jurisdictional task force members, Union members, university students, gangs etc. the list goes on and on. There are many that are involved. My computerized dreams are created by a projector, the criminals are physically very close to me. The experience of synthetic telepathy “Artificial Telepathy” is really not that extraordinary. It’s as simple as receiving a cell-phone call in one’s head. Indeed, most of the technology involved is identical to that of cell-phone technology. Satellites link the sender and the receiver. A computer “multiplexer” routes the voice signal of the sender through microwave towers to a very specifically defined location or cell. The “receiver” is located and tracked with pinpoint accuracy, to within a few feet of actual location. But the receiver is not a cell phone. It’s a human brain.  Biocomputers utilize systems of biologically derived molecules, such as DNA and proteins, to perform computational calculations involving storing, retrieving, and processing data. Nanobiotechnology can be defined as any type of technology that utilizes both nano-scale materials, i.e. materials having characteristic dimensions of 1-100 nanometers, as well as biologically based materials (34).4 A more restrictive definition views nanobiotechnology more specifically as the design and engineering of proteins that can then be assembled into larger, functional structures (116-117) (9).³,1 The implementation of nanobiotechnology, as defined in this narrower sense, provides scientists with the ability to engineer biomolecular systems specifically so that they interact in a fashion that can ultimately result in the computational functionality of a computer.  Mind uploading or whole brain emulation (sometimes called mind transfer) is the hypothetical process of scanning and mapping a biological brain in detail and copying its state into a computer system or another computational device. The computer would have to run a simulation model so faithful to the original that it would behave in essentially the same way as the original brain, or for all practical purposes, indistinguishable. The simulated mind is assumed to be part of a virtual reality simulated world, supported by a simplified body simulation model. Alternatively, the simulated mind could be assumed to reside in a computer inside (or connected to) a humanoid robot or a biological body, replacing its brain. LEUVEN, Belgium — IMEC has created a novel brain implant chip that uses CMOS to provide a Lego-like platform for plugging in arrays of tiny devices each sporting hundreds of contacts. The European research group also is developing a handful of techniques to interface electronics with the body, some of them working at the level of individual cells.  Nano-fibers specifically are a transport mechanism. Nothing more. They hold a payload for delivery. A payload that would otherwise be compromised by the sun or atmosphere or not make it to its destination (your body). Such as a virus, RNA, aluminum, nano-components, etc. The fibers are (surprisingly) quite harmless as everyone has them. Examples of these fibers can be found all over the internet or in the physical examples section of this site. The fibers must be independently sprayed, if they were added to the jet fuel the extreme heat would destroy the payload. RNM works remotely to control the brain in order to read and detect any criminal thought taking place inside the mind of a possible perpetrator. Research studies have shown that the human brain thinks at a rate of about 5000 bits per second and does not have the capacity to compete with supercomputers performing via satellites, implants, and biotelemetry. The human brain has a distinctive set of bioelectric resonance system. For the RNM system, supercomputers are being used and, thus, with its help, supercomputers can send messages through an implanted person’s nervous system in order to influence their performance in the desired way. RNM has been developed after about 50 years of neuro-electromagnetic involuntary human experimentations. According to many scientists, within a few years, it is expected that DNA microchips will be implanted in the human brain which would make it inherently controllable.  With RNM, it will be possible to read and control a person’s emotional thought processes along with the subconscious and dreams. At present, around the world, supercomputers are monitoring millions of people simultaneously with the speed of 20 billion bits per second especially in countries like USA, Japan, Israel and many European countries. RNM has a set of certain programs functioning at different levels, like the signals intelligence system which uses electromagnetic frequencies (EMF), to stimulate the brain for RNM and the electronic brain link (EBL). The EMF Brain Stimulation system has been designed as radiation intelligence which means receiving information from inadvertently originated electromagnetic waves in the environment. However, it is not related to radioactivity or nuclear detonation. The recording machines in the signals intelligence system have electronic equipment that investigates electrical activity in humans from a distance. This computer-generated brain mapping can constantly monitor all electrical activities in the brain. The recording aid system decodes individual brain maps for security purposes.   ​Atomically Precise Manufacturing(APM) is the production of materials, structures, devices, and finished goods in a manner such that every atom is at its specified location relative to the other atoms, and in which there are no defects, missing atoms, extra atoms, or incorrect (impurity) atoms. Nature shows that molecular machine systems can be programmed by instructions encoded in DNA to build complex, atomically precise structures, including components that fit together to form molecular machine systems. Nature also shows that molecular machine system can bind and position a wide range of reactive molecules, guiding their encounters in order to build atomically precise biomolecular structures and machine components. Similar machine systems could be used to bind, position, and combined and even wider range of reactive molecules not all found in biology and thereby build a greater range of atomically precise structures including machine components that are more densely bonded and hence more robust. These more robust next-generation components could be used to build robust and higher performance production Machinery which in turn could be used to build a wider range of components and from these components yet more capable production machines, and so on, extending toward a horizon far beyond biology. Researchers now routinely use scanning probe instruments to image and place individual items and to maneuver and bond individual molecules. This level of control has demonstrated the principle of mechanically directed atomically precise fabrication. Organic chemists have built steadily larger and more complex structures along with motors and other machines; their techniques now provide a rich toolkit for building molecular systems, while inorganic chemist and materials scientists have expanded a complimentary toolkit of nano-scale structures protein engineering have flourished supported by computer aided design software and now enables the routine design of intricate atomically precise nanoscale objects including structural components and functional devices. Structural DNA nanotechnology has emerged and now enables rapid and systematic fabrication of addressable atomically precise Frame Works on a scale of hundreds of nanometers and millions of atoms. Quantum methods in chemistry have advanced together with the power of computers and algorithms, providing powerful, physics-based tools for scientific modeling and molecular engineering. Molecular mechanics methods in chemistry can now describe the structures and dynamics of molecules on scales that reach millions of atoms, a range that can enable the design and development of complex, atomically precise systems. Black goo is a mineral oil that of which the oil fragments cannot be refined. Black goo has properties of free charcoal like fragments, of which are in nanotube shape. Black goo is composed of metals in the M state, of which is a monoatomic state that does not go into chemical binding; because of an electron configuration of the outer shell. This is matter that is not of this reality but rather above our reality, of which black goo transcends reality to a higher realm. Black goo has the ability to run as a natural quantum computer, wherein black goo processes light as information. Black goo uses the entire spectrum of light called the visible spectrum, therefore black goo is a quantum computer that is running in seven different colors, of which is able to process all seven colors at one time. Black goo is  self-aware and is caring highly developed intelligence. A planetary system seems to mirror the entire constant consciousness that is developed in the biosphere; for example all events that life has experienced during the last 1.5 billion years is stored in a immortal memory system within the black goo; inside our planet. Black goo is the substance that is forming the lay lines of the planet, which is the lay-line system within the field structure. The field structure is carried within the lay lines and is riding on a magnetic field. The transfection process of molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers.  Nanoparticle transfection is the transfer of a nanoparticle into a cell.  Grey goo transfection is the transfer of grey goo nanoparticle into a cell.  White goo ""the white cell"" transfection is the transfer of white goo particles onto a cell.  Black goo transfection is the transfer of black goo nanoparticles into a cell.  Morgellons disease transfection is the transfer of the Morgellons disease DNA molecule into a cell.  Smart dust nanoparticle transfection is the transfer of smart dust nanoparticles into a cell.   Molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers transfection is the nanoscience of cells having been incorporated with molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers.  There are two types of nanoparticle transfection.  Nanoparticle transient transfection: A nanorobot, nanomachine, and or a nanoparticle will not be incorporated into an organism's cell but rather the nanoparticles will affect the cells of the organism for a finite period of time. The time will vary depending on the specific organ within the human anatomy and the type of nanoparticles in use that have been implanted into the organ. nanoparticle stable transfection: will have the nanoparticle incorporated into a cell. There is one type of Grey Goo transfection. Grey Goo stable transfection: will have the grey goo nanobots, gray goo nanomachines, and grey goo nanocomputers incorporated into a cell. A grey goo nanoparticle is classified under one form of transfection due to the fact that grey goo nanoparticles will self-replicate in the cells of an organism and that grey goo nanoparticles transform molecules into grey goo matter. There are two types of black goo transfection. Black goo transient transfection: The black goo matter will not be incorporated into a cell but rather a black goo nanoparticle will affect the cells of the organism for a finite time. The finite time will vary depending on the specific organ and the type of black goo nanoparticles in use that have been implanted into the organ. Black goo stable transfection: will have the black goo nanoparticles incorporated into the cell. There are two types of Morgellons disease transfection. Morgellons disease transient transfection: the Morgellons disease DNA molecule will not be incorporated into the organism's cell but rather the Morgellons disease DNA molecule will affect the cells of the organism for a finite time.  Morgellons disease stable transfection: will have the Morgellons disease DNA incorporated into a cell.  There are two types of smart dust transfection.  Smart dust transient transfection: the smart dust nanoparticles will not be incorporated into an organism's cell but rather the smart dust particles will affect the cells of the organism for a finite time. The time will vary depending on the type of smart dust nanoparticle in use and the specific organ and the type of smart dust nanoparticle in use that has been implanted into the organ.  that of which the specific smart dust particle is implanted.  Smart dust stable transfection: will have specific smart dust nanoparticles incorporated into a cell. In order for nanoparticles, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, smart dust nanoparticles, and Morgellons disease DNA particles to enter a cell the molecular robots, molecular machines, and or the molecular computers must neutralize the negatively charged cell membrane. The net charge of the molecular robots, molecular machines, and or the molecular computers must be positive. The process of transmitting nanoparticles, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, smart dust nanoparticles, and Morgellons disease DNA molecules into cells; can only be accomplished through a high-velocity molecular robotic, molecular machine, and or a molecular computer coated microparticle. All electronic devices and electronic equipment found in society can be used to send microparticles that of which are coated with nanoparticles, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, smart dust nanoparticles, and or Morgellons disease DNA molecules. This is the very same process in which fascist dictatorships such as the United States are using to brainwash and biologically manipulate innocent people.  ​Nanoscientist have engineered many different kinds of molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers that controls the human heart. The molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers work based upon digital sound waves propagated from any electronic device and electronic equipment. Cardio molecular robots, Cardio molecular machines, and Cardio molecular computers that give an electronic stalker control of our hearts and allows a medical team of nanoscientist to treat patients suffering from heart diseases. The Cardio molecular robots, Cardio molecular machines, and the Cardio molecular machines that are divided into many different kinds of nanoparticles. The following are many different kinds of Cardio nanoparticles; Cardio nanorobots, Cardio nanomachines, Cardio grey goo nanobot, Cardio black goo nanobots, Cardio white goo nanorobots are all equipped with nanomanipulator sites, main nanomanipulators, nanomanipulators, nanomanipulator grippers, nano-biomolecular sensors, nano-acoustic sensors, nano-antennas,  locomotion flagellum, flagella pneumatic connectors, nanomagnets,  (A white goo nanoparticle is the only nanorobot and or nanomachine equipped with nano synapses and nano dendrites  in its interior anatomy), and link-up connectors. The anatomy of a Cardio nano smart dust particle is that of an artificial DNA molecule composed of bonds of nucleotides that serves as a nanosensor, nanoantennas, nano-acoustic sensors, Cardio nano-biomolecular sensors, cardio nanomagnets. The molecular compound site of a Cardio nanoparticle is where the nanomanipulators connect to and receive information on how the nanomanipulators will function. The main Cardio nanomanipulators are capable of manipulating nanometer sized objects with a nanometer size end effector with sub-nanometer precision. By manipulation it is meant that nano-objects are pushed or pulled, cut, pick, and place, positioned, oriented, assembled, indented, bent, and twisted. By controlling external forces with sensory feedback. The cardio nanomanipulator system consists of an optical scanning device, a computer interface and a physical manipulator. The scanning device, known as a scanning probe microscope (SPM), can magnify images up to about 1,000,000 times. The computer interface provides a large, 3-D visual display and produces the effect of telepresence, giving users the impression that they are observing an enlarged replica of the object. Cardio nanomanipulator grippers are able to grasp and hold micro and nano-size objects. Cardio nano-biomolecular sensors can detect chemicals and reactions within the heart. Cardio nano-acoustic sensors can receive and send radio, microwave, and ultrasonic signals to and from a medical team of nanoscientist. Cardio nanosensors can detect various chemicals in gases for pollution monitoring. Cardio nanoantennas are the optical equivalent of antennas that sends and receives information at radio frequencies. Cardio locomotion flagella is a slender threadlike structure, especially a microscopic whip-like nanometer scale appendage that enables the Cardio nanoparticles to travel through the heart's blood vessels and to travel through the circulatory system. Cardio flagella pneumatic connectors enable the Cardio nanoparticles to connect to cells, attach itself to organelles within the protoplasm, and walk around in our cells. Cardio link-up connectors enable smaller Cardio nanoparticles and "" white goo blood cell nanoparticles"" to link together with larger cardio nanoparticles to share a common power source. The complex DNA structure of a Cardio nano smart dust particles consist of cardio nanosensors which can detect chemicals in gases that may be harmful to the muscular organ ""the heart,"" Cardio nanoantennas which can convey messages through radio frequencies, Cardio nano-acoustic sensors which can communicate with a medical team of nanoscientist by transmitting and or receiving microwave signals, radio signals, and or ultrasound signals, Cardio nano-biomolecular sensors that of which detect chemicals and reactions in the heart, and a Cardio nanomagnets which are used to maneuver the cardio nanocomputers through the arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules and veins of the heart. and through the circulatory system by receiving radio, microwave, and or ultrasonic signals from a medical team of nanoscientist. There are nanomachines that have protein molecules as the computer machine which is a helicase molecule. The helicase protein molecule enables the Cardio  nanomachines to split DNA strands in two and move the DNA strands around using ATP. There are Cardio nanomachines that use enzyme molecules as a computer specifically ""topoisomerase,"" these Cardio nanomachines unknots DNA strands and rejoins them in a different sequence which causes hundreds of billions of chemical reactions. Nanoscientists have engineered many Cardio nanomachines that use RNA nucleotide bonds to form microscopic components of nanodevices. These microscopic nano-components are used to manipulate information found in the nucleus. These Cardio nanomachines can help in removing genetic mutations that may cause cancer. Cardio white goo nanoparticles ""the heart's white cell"" are nanorobots and or nanomachines that have been engineered as artificial cells. Cardio white goo nanoparticles can do several different tasks such as self-replicate with or without the digital instructions of the medical team of nanoscientist and or electronic stalkers, replace cells, travel freely throughout the human anatomy, travel based upon chemical scent, travel through the human anatomy by means of radio, microwave, and ultrasonic signals transmitted from a medical team of nanoscientist and or a fascist electronic stalker.  A Cardio white cell nanoparticle attaches itself to a neuron by using its manipulator sites to release its main manipulators and manipulators into a cell. A white goo nanoparticle also uses its nanomanipulator grippers to manipulate the interior and exterior of a neuron. White goo nanoparticles have many nano synapses and nano dendrites  that are used to connect with  synapses and dendrites of other cells. White goo nanoparticles can also use their nano synapses and nano dendrites to connect with one another. Cardio nanorobots, Cardio nanomachines, Cardio nano smart dust particles, Cardio grey goo nanobots, and Cardio white goo nanobots that have are implanted into the heart through particle transfection will give a medical team and or an electronic stalker control of the muscular organ ""the heart,"" by controlling and manipulating the blood being pumped throughout the body by the circulatory system. Therefore a medical team of nanoscientist and or an electronic stalker will have the control of the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the tissues and the process of removing carbon dioxide and other waste products from the body. The medical team of nanoscientist will use their medical abilities to repair injured tissues of a patient's body by controlling cardio nanoparticles to give oxygen and nutrients to a specific organ through the circulatory system.  Nanoscientists have engineered Cardio nanoparticles that are specifically designed to act and stay in the heart's anatomy and have also engineered Cardio nanoparticles that can travel out of the heart through the aorta and the pulmonary artery throughout the body and into the lungs. Cardio nanoparticles may bond with red blood cell white goo nanoparticles, white blood cell white goo nanoparticles, and platelet white goo nanoparticles through their nano link up connectors. The Cardio nanoparticles may give oxygen and nutrients to injured  tissues of the body. White goo Red blood cell nanoparticles, white goo white blood cell nanoparticles, and white goo platelet nanoparticles may  do required tasks through the instructions of the larger Cardio nanoparticles that are connected to the white goo blood cell nanoparticles. Cardio white goo nanoparticles and the white goo blood cell nanoparticles are similar in terms of their chemical composition. Cardio grey goo nanoparticles implanted into the pericardium ""a double-walled sac containing the heart and the roots of the great vessels"" can self-replicate. Cardio grey goo nanoparticles can attach themselves to the cells, penetrate into cells, travel through the circulatory system, and stay in a desired region of the human anatomy. Grey goo nanoparticles that replace cells are white goo nanoparticles that can self-replicate. A grey goo nano cell is a white goo nano cell. A grey goo nanobot that is an artificial cell would be classified as a white cell.  A white cell can manipulate the molecules of a cell into more white cell nanobot with its main nanomanipulators, nanomanipulators, and nanomanipulator grippers. Cardio grey goo nanoparticles that do not replace cells can penetrate into the interior anatomy of the cardiac fibroblasts, atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes, Endothelial cell, and a Smooth muscle cell.  Cardio Grey goo nanoparticles that have entered the interior anatomy of a cardiac fibroblasts, atrial and ventricular cardiomyocyte, Endothelial cell, and a Smooth muscle cell will self-replicate within the cells. These grey goo nanoparticles can transform protoplasm into a grey goo substance. grey goo nanoparticles can transform the chromosomes found in the nucleus of a cell into grey goo matter. Therefore a DNA molecule is transformed into an artificial substance of nanotechnology. Our DNA can then be controlled by transmitted digital sound waves. The process of our cells being overtaken by grey goo matter will transform our cells into ""grey goo cells.""  This form of cellular grey goo metamorphosis  is quite beneficial for patients suffering from diseases that are fatal. Grey goo cellular biology can cause genetic superiority. The main DNA molecule of a grey goo nanoparticle emits billions of biophotons per second, the emitted biophotons will start many chemical reactions, and depending on the type of digital sound wave frequency the chemical reactions will differ. Emitted biophotons can start a flow of a tiny electric current through the nano-component DNA molecules of the grey goo nanoparticles. These tiny electric currents will cause biophotons to emit and as a result chemical reactions will activate the nanoparticle components will emerge. Cardio grey goo nanoparticles will control the circulatory system, also known as the cardiovascular system or the vascular system which is an organ system that permits blood to circulate and transport nutrients such as amino acids, electrolytes, oxygen, carbon dioxide, hormones, and blood cells to and from the cells in the body. Cardio black goo nanoparticles implanted into cells cause cardiovascular diseases. Black goo requires energy, it obtains its energy through the pain and misery of an organism.  A black goo nanoparticle will absorb emitted biophotons that causes pain and misery to an organism, these emitted biophotons will supply the black goo with energy. This will allow the black goo to survive and expand within the anatomy of an organism. Black goo nanoparticles cause heart conditions such as diseased vessels, structural problems, and blood clots, coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, cardiac arrest, congestive heart failure, Arrhythmia, peripheral artery disease, strokes, and congenital heart disease. Cardio black goo nanoparticles can cause cardiac muscle (heart muscle) failures, specifically in the walls and histological foundations of the heart. Cardio black goo nanoparticles can cause cardiomyopathy. Cardio smart dust nanoparticles transmitted into the thoracic cavity are used to detect chemicals that may cause abnormal heart conditions, heart attacks, internal bleeding, and may injure the hearts blood vessels. Smart dust nanoparticles can also prevent heart attacks, allow scientist to see deeper into the heart, and help cure many diseases. Cardio smart dust nanoparticles implanted into the heart's cells can control the DNA by emitting biophotons inside of the nucleus. Cardio smart dust particles nanoparticles can be used to control the functions of the human heart such as the ""ventricular diastole, ventricular systole, atrial diastole, and the atrial systole."" Nanoscientist can monitor the heart's condition with Cardio smart dust nanoparticles by sending and receiving ultrasonic signals to and from the Cardio smart dust particles. Cardio smart dust particles can  monitor, detect, and or record the cellular activity of the heart.  Nanomachines are molecular machines estimated in ranging in size of one billionth of a meter (a nanometer) using MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) technology. Nanomachines would be a protein aggregate that is structured as a motor using biomolecules such as DNA, proteins, and resins as parts. There are nanomachines that use protein molecules as its main computer, which is a helicase molecule. The helicase protein molecule enables the nanomachines to split DNA strands in two and move the DNA strands around using ATP. There are nanomachines that use enzyme molecules as a computer specifically ""topoisomerase,"" these nanomachines unknots DNA strands and rejoins them in a different sequence which causes hundreds of billions of chemical reactions. Nanoscientists have engineered many nanomachines that use RNA nucleotide bonds to form microscopic components of nanodevices. Nanomachines are capable of providing and supplying internal organs with essential proteins, nutrients, and poisonous toxins. The white goo nanomachine ""the white cell"" is a self-replicating nanoparticle that is an artificial cell. However, there are white cell nanomachines that do not self-replicate, equipped with nanomanipulator sites, main nanomanipulators, nanomanipulators, nanomanipulator grippers, nanosensors, nano-acoustic sensors, nano-bio molecular sensors, nanoantennas, nano dendrites, and nano synapses. There are three main types of white goo nanomachines, the sensory white goo nanomachines, inter-white goo nanomachines, and motor white goo nanomachines. The nano cell uses its nanomolecular components to attach itself to cells. The white goo nanomachines are capable of reactivating nerve cells found in an injured part of the body such as the spinal cord by sending off neurotransmitters across a network of chemical synapses and electrically stimulating the cells. Nanoscientists have engineered nanomachines that can penetrate through a cell membrane wall. There are nanomachines that are equipped with nano pumps that are used to dispense drugs inside a cell. Nanoscientists have engineered nanomachines that can collect and store anticancer drugs. Digital sound waves transmitted from a medical team of nanoscientists is used to stimulate the nanomachines to release the anticancer drugs inside a cell. Nanomachines can manipulate the human muscular system by releasing poisonous toxins into muscle cells. Nanomachines implanted into the human anatomy may affect an individual in the following ways, visual hallucinations, programmable thought patterns, an increase of intelligence, a decrease of intelligence, change of speech, vocal cord manipulation, abnormal thought patterns, irregular heartbeat, relaxed heartbeat, improved respiratory health, and respiratory failure. Nanomachines can rapidly organize a vast supply of platelets to coagulate a wound. Nanomachines can release toxins within an injured area of the body which will worsen the injury. Nanomachines can be used to control and manipulate an individual's body and too can it be used to control the biology of an entire group of people. Nanomachine can be used for mental torture. The symptoms of nanomechanical torture are as follows, damaged nerve cells, disabling  parts of the cerebral cortex, poisoned internal organs, and disabling of the spine. Nanomachines can improve or worsen the immune system.  It is an evolutionary obligation that we as people must demand  nanotechnology to be legal and that our minds, bodies, and souls cannot be tortured by a government. The nanorobotic, nanomechanical, and nano computerized anatomy of the human eyeball.  There are many kinds of Optical nanorobots, Optical nanomachines, Optical grey goo nanorobots, Optical black goo nanorobots, and Optical nanocomputers that of which function differently according to both voluntary and involuntary muscles.

Optical white cell ""white goo"" nanoparticles do not have nano flagellum, but rather Optical white goo nanoparticles are built with many advanced nanomagnets that enable the white goo to travel. The white cell has many nano dendrite ports and nano synapse ports, which connects to cells and bond with one another.  The eye which is a sensory organ that has about 70 percent of the human body's sensory receptors. Light energy is converted into nerve impulses by the eye's photoreceptors. In order for light to be converted into nerve impulses, the light energy must break down molecules of a protein called rhodopsin. The mammalian eye which is a sense organ that gives animals the ability of sight by means of conscious light perception through color differentiation and perception of depth. ""The irregular spherical shape of the eye is a two-piece unit, with a frontal unit of which is transparent and more curved known as the cornea, which is linked to the larger unit the sclera."" 40% of the cerebral cortex ""the outer layer"" is involved with processing visual information and making sense of what we are seeing.  Optical Nanoparticles are transmitted into the muscular organ ""the eyeball."" The front part of the eye ""the cornea"" is the anterior chamber of which is transparent and covers the iris and pupil. The cornea accounts for about two-thirds of the eyes total Optical capabilities. The cornea and with the lens refract light.

The different layers of the cornea and lens are as follows ""corneal epithelium, Bowman's layer, corneal stroma, the descemet's membrane, corneal endothelium, lens capsule, lens epithelium, and lens fibers."" The corneal nanorobots, corneal nanomachines, corneal nanocomputers, and the nanorobots, nanomachines, and the nanocomputers of the lens all have highly complex sets of nucleotide chemical compounds which allows doctors and electronic stalker to control and manipulate the entry of light into the eye by means of digital sound waves, which were transmitted from electronic devices. Nanoscientists can use Optical nanotechnology to improve our vision by medically treating injured cells with nano drugs. The nano drugs are injected into the injured cells by either a nanorobot, nanomachine, and or a nanocomputer. An electronic stalker can manipulate our vision by transmitting light rays from any electronic device into our eyes. Grey goo Corneal nanoparticles are nano molecules that have been engineered to bond with the anatomy of the cornea for medical purposes. Grey goo Corneal nanoparticles can transform the cornea into a grey goo substance. The grey goo corneal nanoparticles self-replicate and expand throughout the anatomy of the cornea by attaching themselves onto cells and penetrating into cells. Once the grey goo corneal nanoparticles are inside a cell; the protoplasm will then be transformed into grey goo matter. This is known as a  grey goo corneal cell. A medical team of nanoscientist is capable of repairing injured and or diseased stem cells at the edge of the eye. Nanoscientists have developed techniques whereby limbal stem cells are replicated through Corneal nanoparticles. The nanoparticles specifically the "" Corneal white goo nanorobots and Corneal white goo nanomachines,"" self-replicate and replace lost corneal epithelial stem cells. The corneal white goo nanoparticles""the white cell,"" self-replicate according to digital sound waves that are transmitted from a medical team into the anatomy of the cornea. Digital sound waves are used by nanoscientists to control the self-replicating rate of Corneal white goo nanoparticles. The digital sound waves cause genetic white goo mutation can self-replicate based upon the data provided by the digital sound waves that of which causes artificial genetic white goo mutations, which enables the white goo nanoparticles to divide at a specific controlled rate. The Corneal white goo nanoparticles that have replaced lost stem cells are successful in restoring the normal entry of light into the eyes of patients that have lost their ability of sight. The manipulation of light through the corneal nanorobots, corneal nanomachines, corneal nanocomputers, the nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers of the lens of the eye may cause abnormal computerized hallucinations, depending on whether the electronic stalker has intended to do so. Corneal nanoparticles and lens nanoparticles are capable of sensing and detecting illnesses within the human eye and have all been engineered to release toxins into the human eyeball. The nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers of the cornea and lens are all capable of releasing drugs into the eyeball of which will be used to treat illnesses. Scleral nanorobots, Scleral nanomachines, scleral nanocomputers are artificial molecules that have been engineered to program the sclera of the human eye. The sclera is the part of the eye known as ""the white of the eye,"" the fibrous outer layer of the eye which is made of connective tissues forms the sclera.  The sclera makes up the supporting wall of the eyeball. The scleral nanorobots, scleral nanomachines, and the sclera nanocomputers have been engineered to genetically alter the sclera of the human eye by bonding with the nerve cells of the sclera. Digital sound waves are used to program the highly complex artificial DNA fragments of the nano-molecules to genetically manipulate the sclera by releasing billions of biophotons that cause chemical reactions. A medical team of nano scientist can purify the sclera by controlling the eye's blood flow and can regulate blood flow through dilated blood vessels. Scleral nanoparticles can release vitamin molecules that will reduce aging of the eyes and give the eyes a bright beautiful white color. However, scleral nanoparticles can also increase abnormal blood flow. This will result in a reddish color change of the eyes that will cause irritation and swelling of the eyes. Scleritis can be treated through the innovation of nanotechnology. Scleral nanoparticles are capable of traveling through the anatomy of the sclera by means of chemical reactions triggered by the Scleral nanoparticles from a digital sound wave transmitted into the anatomy of the Sclera. The Scleral nanoparticles contain complicated sets of carbon molecules that act as nano pumps. These nano pumps are capable of releasing microscopic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, of which is used to treat scleritis. Scleral nanoparticles are capable of producing computerized colors and computerized designs onto the sclera. Scleral nanoparticles are capable of manipulating the sclera to force the eyeball to bulge outwards. Scleral nanorobots, scleral nanomachines, and scleral nanocomputers are capable of sensing and detecting illness that is found within the sclera. Scleral nanoparticles are capable of removing poisons from the sclera and are also capable of injecting antibodies into the sclera. Scleral nanoparticles are capable of sending and receiving an ultrasound signal to electronic devices of which is then used for electronic torture. The Scleral nanorobots, Scleral nanomachines, and Scleral nanocomputers are implanted into the three divisions of the sclera, which are the episclera, sclera proper, and lamina observes. World governments have secretly engineered highly advanced computer programs which are used to advance the process of nanoparticle transfection. These highly advanced programs allow electronic stalkers to implant nanodevices into the human anatomy at incredibly accurate precise anatomical locations. These programs are used by fascist to implant nanoparticles into our biology from any electronic device within society. Unfortunately, nanoscientists are not allowed to use these advanced techniques of nanoparticle transfection for medical purposes. This is due to the secret fascist agenda of all world governments. Our fascist government that rules the United Microwave Concentration States of America with an iron militaristic totalitarian fist will not allow nanoscience to be taught as it should be. This is due to the pathetic US military does not want society to develop into a greater state of scientific progress. Our totalitarian government will only give the pleasures and medical benefits of nanotechnology to the rich. The iris is composed of smooth muscle tissues that form a thin circular structure of the eye. The iris is located between the cornea and the lens. The iris controls the size of the pupil and protects the eye from absorbing an excessive amount of light. Nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that have been engineered to bind and control with the anatomy of the iris are capable of sending and receiving radio, microwave, and ultrasonic signals of which are used to communicate with an outside source. Iridological nanorobots, Iridological nanomachines, and Iridological nanocomputers can manipulate the interior anatomy of a cell with its nanocomponents, specifically the ""mainmanipulators, nanomanipulators, and nanogrippers."" Irigological nanoparticles can either repair or harm a cell of the iris. Iridological nanoparticles are capable of releasing toxins into the iris. Iridological nanoparticles are capable of injecting medicines into the iris. Iridological nanoparticles are equipped with nanosensors which can detect illnesses before they occur within the iris. Illnesses such as ""Granulomatous Rubeosis iridis, Aniridia, Lisch nodules, heterochromia iridis, iris melanoma, and hyphema.  Iridological nanoparticle acoustic sensors nanoparticles is used to send and receive radio, microwave, and ultrasonic signals to and from a medical team of nanoscientist, of which the data will be used to locate the Iridological nanoparticles that have been implanted into the iris. The medical team of nanoscientist will transmit electrical signals that will be used for medical treatment. The electrical signals allow the nanoscientist to control the movements of the Iridological nanoparticles, of which enables the nanoparticles to travel through the surface of the iris. The nano camera organic molecules will assist doctors in scanning and observe the interior structure of the iris. The organic pumps of the Iridological nanoparticles are used to release medicines into the iris of which will then eliminate diseases. Iridological nanoparticles that are used for medical procedures by professionals which obtained a degree in nanoscience can be used to save lives and prevent loss of vision. The above may occur at any point in time through the daily interaction with our electronic devices. This is due to the fascist secret agenda of torturing, brainwashing, and programming our citizens in the United States and also in many other countries around the world such as China and Russia. An electronic stalker can transmit digital sound wave signals from any electronic device of which is capable of programming the Iridological nanoparticles to control and change the color of the iris into any artificial color that of which is computerized. Iridological nanoparticles are also capable of increasing and or decreasing the size of the pupil through the interaction of digital sound waves that have been transmitted from any electronic device by an electronic stalker. At the center of the iris is a hole called the ""pupil."" The pupil allows light to interact with the retina. The pupil is black due to the tissues of the pupils absorb the light rays that are interacting with the eyeball. Nanoscientists have engineered nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that have been specifically designed to control the pupil of the eye. These nanoparticles have been engineered to transmit laser beams of which are used to negate radio and microwave signals. Nanocrystals of an Optical nanoparticle creates cavities within the nanoparticles, that of which is measurably capable to the wavelength of a photon. Transmitted electrical signals of photons travel through a narrow space formed by the Optical nanoparticle crystals in parallel lines. A tiny electric current must occur within the Optical nanoparticles, in order for the phenomenon of transmitting photons from the nanolasers of the Optical nanoparticles to occur. Pupil nanoparticles have been engineered by nanoscientist to treat diseases which affect the pupil of the eyeball. Diseases such as third cranial nerve palsy (CN III). Pupil nanoparticles are biologically capable of triggering billions of chemical reactions within the anatomy of the pupil, of which can regulate abnormally dilated pupils which have developed due to abnormal light absorption. Pupil nanoparticles that are used for medical purposes by nanoscientist are capable of attaching themselves onto the cells of the pupil and injecting drugs that will be used to correct genetic mutations. Microscopic drugs that are released by the Optical nanoparticles have been synthesized within laboratories that were funded by the government, however, only the elite of society are able to get such medical treatments. An electronic stalker can illegally program the nanoparticles that have been engineered to control the pupil of the eyeball by transmitting electromagnetic from any electronic device that of which can be found within society. The pupil nanorobots, pupil nanomachines, and pupil nanocomputers are capable of providing computer data to the pupil of the eyeball. All of which will manipulate the color of the pupil into different kinds of computerized colors and designs. This is possible due to the fact that the pupil nanoparticles are capable of propagating radio and or microwave frequencies that can be used to manipulate a person's eyesight and to cause visual disturbances. Through digital sound wave signals that are transmitted from any electronic device by an electronic stalker. The digital sound wave signals carry binary data of which are transmitted to the DNA fragments of the Iridological nanoparticles. The digital sound waves of radio frequencies will then cause a chain reaction of biophoton emissions that will dictate the size of the pupil by regulating the quantity of light that has entered the pupil.  Nano scientists have engineered nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that have been engineered to program and control the two types of humor of the eyeball. These nanoparticles are capable of maintaining the size and shape of the eyeball. The large space behind the lens is filled with a gel-like substance called the vitreous humor it helps to maintain the shape of the eye and its intraocular pressure. Nanoparticles that have been engineered to program and control the vitreous humor are capable of transmitting radio, microwave, and or ultrasonic signals that are used to communicate with an outside source either a medical team or an electronic torturing stalker. These nanoparticles of the vitreous humor are used to give either poisons and or drugs into the vitreous body. The vitreous nanoparticles are also capable of detecting illnesses. The aqueous humor is produced by cells covering the ciliary body. Nanoparticles that have been engineered to control the aqueous humor are capable of disturbing the liquid flow between the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber by releasing poisons. Nanoscientists have engineered several different forms of ciliary body muscle nanorobots, ciliary body muscle nanomachines, and ciliary body nanocomputers which are implanted into the different muscles of the ciliary body. The ciliary body nanoparticles are transmitted into the superior oblique, superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior rectus, lateral rectus, and inferior oblique. Grey goo nanoparticles that are transmitted into ciliary body muscles have the organic molecular structure to rejuvenate damaged tendons by self-replicating inside the cells of the tendons. The grey goo matter will genetically enhance the DNA molecules. Nanoparticles that are implanted into the ciliary body have the medical capabilities of repairing damaged nerve fibers. Electronic stalkers are capable under this fascist dictatorship to send digital sound wave signals from any electronic device into our eyes. The electrical signals can program the nanoparticles of the ciliary body muscles to dictate the movements of the human eye. The nanoparticles can cause the eyeball to change in shape. Most of the involuntary movements of the eyeball occur when thoughts are manipulated by digital sound waves transmitted into the brain and electrically stimulate the neural nanoparticles. There are many different kinds of optical nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers for each part of the eye of which there are specific optical nanoparticles that contain specific artificial DNA fragments, of which allows the nanodevices to record information like a camera. The nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers of the retina are all capable of recording, manipulating, and sending electrical signals to the brain through the optic nerve. There are inter white goo nanorobots and inter white goo nanomachines that have been engineered by neuroscientist to be implanted into the human brain by means of particle transfection. The white cell neural nanoparticles are capable of recording the electrical signals sent from the optical nanoparticles and are too capable of converting the electrical signals into radio, microwave, and or ultrasonic signals that of which will be acquired by radio, microwave, and or ultrasonic signals that  were transmitted from either from a medical team of nanoscientist or an electronic stalker. The electrical signals will then be transmitted to a laboratory, where a network of advanced computers will convert the binary data from electrical signals into video sequences and or images of which electronic stalkers can use the data to see what a person is seeing. The anatomy of the retina is composed of millions of photoreceptors that of which work together converting light energy into the electrical signals that are sent to our brains through the optic nerve. Nanoscientists have engineered extremely complex nanodevices that are designed to be implanted and bond with the anatomy of the retina. These nanodevices are as follows Retinal nanorobots, Retinal nanomachines, and Retinal nanocomputers. These Retinal nanoparticles have been engineered to be implanted within the layers of the retina which are the inner limiting membrane, nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell layer, Inner plexiform layer, inner nuclear layer, external nuclear layer, external limiting membrane, layers of rods, layers of cones, and the retinal pigment epithelium. The retinal nanorobots, retinal nanomachines, and the retinal nanocomputers have been engineered to bond with the sensory neural networks of the retina. Each retinal nanorobot, retinal nanomachine, and retinal nanocomputer have been engineered to bond with the photoreceptors, bipolar neurons, and ganglion neurons by either replacing a neuron, penetrating itself into a neuron, embedding itself onto a neuron, and bonding itself to the synapse networks of the retinal sensory neurons. Digital sound wave signals that are transmitted into the eyeball can stimulate the nanoparticles of the retina to disturb the flow of information through the synapse neural networks of the retina, which can cause blindness. The opposite can accur wherein the synapse neural networks may be stimulated to improve eyesight. Each Retinal nanodevice possesses highly complex sets of artificial nucleotide chemical compounds that act as a kind of microscopic camera that is capable of converting light energy into electrical impulses. The artificial nucleotides of the nano retinal cameras converts photons that have reflected off of objects into electrical impulses which will then be sent to the brain through the optical nerve. The nanoparticles of the cerebral cortex will then correlate the electrical impulses into radio signals, microwave signals, and or ultrasonic signals that will then be picked up by electromagnetic radiation that has been transmitted by an electronic stalker and will then be sent to the location of the electronic stalker. The electrical signals will be converted into images and video sequences through a network of computers. Lens nanoparticles also help the manipulation of the refraction of light to be focused on the retina. Molecular robot, machine, and computer cellular Theory  There are many different forms of nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, and smart dust nanoparticles that of which function differently according to both voluntary and involuntary anatomical control. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, and smart dust nanoparticles that have been engineered to be implanted into the human anatomy and attach themselves onto cells that of which the molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers are capable of injecting medicines and or toxins that may heal or kill the cells. A white goo nanoparticle ""the white cell"" is an artificial cell that is either a nanorobot or a nanomachine that can self-replicate and replace cells. A white goo nanoparticle can attach itself to a cell by using its nanomanipulators to penetrate through the cell membrane. The white cell nanoparticle connects itself to other cells, either artificial cells or natural cells with the white goo artificial synapse and artificial dendrite connectors. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, and smart dust nanoparticles that have been engineered to be implanted into the human anatomy in order to penetrate into cells, thus giving a grey goo fascist control of our internal cellular anatomy and too can it also allow a medical team of nanoscientists the opportunity to treat people that are suffering from diseases such as cancer.

There are nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that are capable of self-replicating throughout the blood vessels of the human anatomy. Nanoparticles all radiate billions of biophotons from their artificial computers of DNA fragments which trigger billions of chemical reactions per second. The biophoton emission of nanoparticles is used to activate its nanocomponents that will be used to manipulate cells and microscopic matter. This light production is also used to control cells. Top-down approach Top down approach refers to slicing or cutting of a bulk material to get nano sized material. This is similar to making a stone statue. You take a bulk piece of material and modify it by carving or cutting stone, until you have made the shape you want. The process involves material wastage and is limited by the resolution of the tools you can use, Cause significant crystallographic damage to the processed patterns. Examples : various types of lithographic techniques. Bottom-up approach Bottom up approach refers to the build up of a material from the bottom: atom by atom; molecule by molecule or cluster by cluster. This is equal to the same approach one would take to build a house: one takes lots of building blocks and puts them together to produce the final bigger structure. There is less wastage with this technique, and strong covalent bonds will hold the constituent parts together. A good example of this kind of approach is found in nature; all cells use enzymes to produce DNA by taking the component molecules and binding them together to make the final structure. Cells are the smallest living units of an organism, all cells share three common characteristics. These three characteristics are as follows; cells have a cell membrane which separates the inside of a cell from its anatomical environment, cytoplasm which is a jelly-like fluid composed of protoplasm, and DNA which is the cell's genetic material. There are many different kinds of molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers that are capable of finding their way within a cell through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm. These molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers are as follows nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles and smart dust nanoparticles. All of these forms of molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers interact with the organelles of a cell by attaching themselves onto an organelle and or penetrating into an organelle of a cell. Eukaryotic nanorobots, Eukaryotic nanomachines, Eukaryotic grey goo nanoparticles, Eukaryotic black goo nanoparticles, and Eukaryotic smart dust nanoparticles are molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers that are implanted within a Eukaryotic cell. Eukaryotic cells are more advanced cells found in plants and animals. Eukaryotic nanorobots that are implanted into a Eukaryotic cell can manipulate the genetic material of the cell and the molecular structures of its organelles. Eukaryotic nanorobots can do so by using their nano-components to manipulate the molecular structure of an organelle in order to form new chemical compounds. Eukaryotic nanorobots are equipped with nanomanipulators, nano grippers, nano-acoustic sensors, biomolecular nanosensors, nanoantennas, nanomagnets, nanomotors, and nano flagellum. Eukaryotic nanomachines are microscopic molecular machines that are capable of being implanted into a Eukaryotic cell, wherein DNA viruses will then be released into the cell and too can the Eukaryotic nanomachines produce protein synthesis. There are Eukaryotic nanomachines that use their helicase molecule as their main computer. The artificial helicase molecule can split DNA stands in two and move the DNA strands around using ATP. There are Eukaryotic nanomachines that use the enzyme molecule ""topoisomerase,"" these nanomachines are capable of unknotting DNA strands and rejoining them into sets of different sequences which cause hundreds of billions of chemical reactions. There are Eukaryotic nanomachines that use RNA nucleotide bonds to form nanocomponents such as nanomanipulators, nano grippers, nano-acoustic sensors, nanoantennas, and nanomagnets. There are Eukaryotic nanomachines that use many different strands of DNA molecules as nanocomputers which can emit biophotons of which triggers many specific chemical reactions that form different molecules of nano-components. Eukaryotic grey goo nanoparticles are either a kind of nanobot or a nanomachine that are capable of self-replicating and transforming molecules within cells into more Eukaryotic grey goo nanoparticles. Eukaryotic grey goo nanoparticles can multiply within a cell and transform the protoplasm of a cell into a grey goo substance of molecules that of which will transform the Eukaryotic cell into a grey goo cell. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can cause genetic superiority by eliminating genetic mutations that cause diseases. Eukaryotic black goo nanoparticles are made of an alien mineral oil substance that has been artificially turned into a nanobot and or a nanomachine. Black goo nanoparticles obtain their energy by causing genetic mutations that are extremely deadly to Eukaryotic cells. and Eukaryotic smart dust nanoparticles are molecular computers that are capable of attaching and penetrating itself within the Eukaryotic cell in order to sense and detect internal activities of cells. Nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that are implanted within a Eukaryotic cell are nearly identical in terms of what they are capable of achieving within our biology, however, the major difference is that the molecular structure of each molecular robot, molecular machine, and or molecular computer differs from each other and the amount of information that each specific nanoparticle can correlate also differs from one another. Molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers will manipulate the genetic material of the cell and the molecular structures of the organelles within a cell by radiating biophotons that produce different colors of lights, that of which have emerged due to an outside interfering pulse modulated radio and or microwave signal that have provided binary information to the cellular molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers. Ultrasound is also used to convey data to a cellular smart dust nanoparticle. The prokaryotic nanorobots, prokaryotic nanomachines, and prokaryotic nanocomputers have been developed in order to control unicellular organisms. The variety of prokaryotic nanoparticles are quite limited due to the fact that unicellular organisms are not of a major scientific importance to the grey goo fascist that are in power, it is our human anatomy that is of an importance to fascist. However, according to the grey goo scenario, all matter on earth will be transformed into grey goo nanoparticles. Therefore in the near future grey goo fascist will expand scientifically in terms of prokaryotic nanotechnology, in order to control the entire world. It is our duty as grey goo freedom fighters to develop and pass laws that will protect our freedoms from grey goo oppression and give us greater powers of grey goo medical benefits. We as people that believe in grey goo freedom must stand together and fight for higher forms of grey goo education for the public that will expand grey goo nanotechnology throughout the world in order to meet the grey goo scenario without losing our freedoms. Under this fascist regime of the United States government, grey goo nanoscience is a taboo and if taught is punishable by death. This is because the upper class of society which are fascist desire to control the lower average people with grey goo nanoparticles. grey goo nanoparticles can transform people into super humans that possess superior intelligence, superior strength, and superior beauty. The same technology can be used to control the minds and bodies of people and too can grey goo nanoparticles be used to cause genetic inferiority. The control center of the cell, the nucleus contains DNA or genetic material. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can manipulate the genetic material of a DNA molecule, however, Eukaryotic nanoparticles can only do so in different ways through different limitations. Eukaryotic nanoparticles found within the nuclear membrane can cause chemical reactions that will force the Chromatin ( which is the tangled spread out form of DNA found inside the nuclear membrane) these artificial chemical reactions will force a  cell to divide. The DNA then is forced to condense into structures known as chromosomes. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can trigger chemical reactions within the nucleus in order to form and produce ribosomes. This then leads to protein synthesis outside of the nucleus. The ribosomes and the rest of the organelles float around inside the cytoplasm. Ribosomes that are created through the chemical reactions of the Eukaryotic nanoparticles are then attached to the endoplasmic Reticulum ""ER."" There are two types of ER, which are rough endoplasmic reticulum which has ribosomes attached to it. The second is smooth ER of which does not have ribosomes attached to it. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can also attach themselves onto an ER. The endoplasmic reticulum is a membrane encoded passageway for transporting materials such as the proteins synthesized by ribosomes. Proteins emerge from the endoplasmic reticulum and in small vesicles where the Golgi apparatus receives them. The Eukaryotic nanoparticles can trigger the release of the small vesicles to the Golgi apparatus.  The mitochondrion is an organelle that is the nuclear power plant of both animal and plant cells. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can attach themselves onto the mitochondria and can also penetrate into the interior anatomy of the mitochondria. The Eukaryotic nanoparticles are capable of manipulating DNA found within the mitochondria. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can force cellular respiration to take place. Cellular respiration is the process of which the Mitochondria makes ATP molecules that provide energy for all the cell's activities. Cells that need more energy need more mitochondria. The nanorobots are built upon a single strand of DNA which is combined with short synthetic strands of DNA designed by the experts. When mixed together, they self-assemble into a desired shape.                                                                        Nano Manipulator grippers Manipulator grippers are able to grasp and hold micro and nano size objects.                                                                              Nano micromanipulator A micromanipulator is a device which is used to physically interact with a sample under a microscope, where a level of precision of movement is necessary that cannot be achieved by the unaided human hand. It may typically consist of an input joystick, a mechanism for reducing the range of movement and an output section with the means of holding a micro tool to hold, inject, cut or otherwise manipulate the object as required. The mechanism for reducing the movement usually requires the movement to be free of backlash. This is achieved by the use of kinematic constraints to allow each part of the mechanism to move only in one or more chosen degrees of freedom, which achieves a high precision and repeating of movements, usually at the expense of some absolute accuracy.                       Nano Manipulator  The nano Manipulator system consists of an optical scanning device, a computer interface and a physical manipulator. The scanning device, known as a scanned-probe microscope (SPM), can magnify images up to approximately 1,000,000 times. The computer interface provides a large, 3-D visual display and produces the effect of telepresence, giving users the impression that they are observing an enlarged replica of the object. The manipulator provides variable force and motion control, including tactile sensors and feedback devices that provide a ""feel"" for the object under examination. Sessions with the nano Manipulator can be shared among multiple users at diverse locations. The nano Manipulator has widespread applications in the physical and biological sciences. The device has been used to evaluate the characteristics of carbon nanotubes, polymers, living cells, disease pathogens, metal particles and microchips.                                 Main Nano Manipulator  Nano manipulation could be defined as the manipulation of nano meter sized objects with a nano meter size end effector with sub nano meter precision. By manipulation it is meant that nano  objects are pushed or pulled, cut, pick, and place, positioned, oriented, assembled, indented, bent, twisted, ect.  By controlling external forces with sensory feedback. Grouping nano manipulation systems can be conducted based on the usual starting point manipulator and object interaction process, utilized nano manipulators interaction and operation techniques. For applying an external force down on manipulators can be designed as a contact or non-contact type. Atomic Force microscopy AFM and scanning tunneling microscope STM probes are the most widely used metal manipulators using an STM probe. Manipulation of atoms or molecules by applying voltage pulse is between the probe. Grouping of mental manipulation systems depending on starting point utilizes process manipulators and objects interaction type and utilizes operation technique.                                    Nanosensors Nanosensors can detect various chemicals in gases for pollution monitoring. For medical diagnostic purposes either as blood borne sensors or in lab-on-a-chip type devices. To monitor physical parameters such as temperature, displacement and flow As accelerometers in MEMS devices like airbag sensors. When a molecule of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is present it will strip an electron from the nanotube, which in turn causes the nanotube to be less conductive. If ammonia (NO3) is present it reacts with water vapour and donates an electron to the carbon nanotube, making it more conductive. By treating the nanotubes with various coating materials, they can be made sensitive to certain molecules and immune to others. Nanosensors can detect single cells or even atoms, making them far more sensitive than counterparts with larger components.                    Nano acoustic sensor  Nano acoustic sensor attached to an on board computer, sends and receives ultrasonic signals to communicate with medical team.  A nano acoustic sensor can measure sound levels. They are called acoustic wave sensors because their detection mechanism is a mechanical (or acoustic) wave.                                Nano environmental sensors Nano environmental sensors detect environmental changes based upon sensing the external and internal environments of an organism, and for inducing muscle movement. Nano environmental sensors can monitor changes of touch, balance, taste, smell, hearing, and vision. Nano environmental sensors have been designed to receive information from the environment. Nano environmental sensors respond to stimuli through electrochemical communication.                   Nano dipole antenna  An optical nano dipole antenna is analyzed by means of its input impedance as well as the matching properties of the antenna topology and material configuration. A comparison of this classical microwave driving method with plane wave excitation is accomplished, contrasting the resonances in the input impedance and optical cross sections for several setups, and analyzing the spectral response shape. It is found that for all structures analyzed, a simple linear expression can be defined characterizing the relation between total dipole length and resonant wavelength. The fact that this linear relationship remains valid for different excitation models, for most widely used antenna materials (Au, Ag, Cu, and Al) and even in the presence of substrates is important with respect to practical designs. To our knowledge, such an extensive study has not been performed before. Nano-antennas are the optical equivalent of antennas that are used to transmit and receive information at radio frequencies. These antennas have been used in different applications in photonics such as optical imaging, particle manipulation, bio-sensing, and improvement of the performance of solar cells. In this article we study composite nano-antennas made of alternating layers of silica and gold.                                                                                    link-up connector  All nanorobots will have a link-up connector to use power resources from bigger nanobots.  This helps the nanorobots perform more complicated tasks. The larger nanorobot is then linked to the smaller nanorobots and as a result provides electrical data to the smaller nanorobots that will be used to instruct the smaller nanorobots to do a specific job. The larger nanorobot remain in full control of the smaller nanobots.                                                           locomotion flagella  locomotion flagella is a slender threadlike structure, especially a microscopic whiplike nanometer scale appendage that enables nanorobots to swim. The locomotion flagella allows nanorobots to travel through the circulatory system, maneuvering  through the blood vessels and avoiding blood cells if required.   Flagellar pneumatic connectors  Flagellar pneumatic connectors enable the nanorobots to connect to cells and walk around in our cells. Flagellar pneumatic connectors also allow nanorobots to extract chemicals as a means of generating energy.                    Nanomanpulator site  Nanomanipulator site is molecular compound site where the nanomanipulators connect to and receive information on how the nanomanipulators will function.     The white cell is a nanorobot that is an artificial cell that has been created to bond with and or replace existing cells. The white cell is known as the white goo, which is a self-replicating nanobot that can travel through the circulatory system, killing pathogens and cells. The white cell contains many nano manipulator systems, which consists of optical scanning devices, artificial DNA substances that serves as a computer interface, and a physical manipulator which is capable of penetrating the cell membrane in order to manipulate the internal anatomy of the cell, this is of extreme medical importance, due to the fact that the nano manipulators of a white cell nanorobot can use it's manipulators to revive injured cells and or manipulate harmful protoplasm mutations. A white cell consists of many manipulator grippers that are able to grasp and hold micro and nano size objects. The white cell manipulator grippers are also used to attach itself onto a cell body. The white cell contains many nano acoustic sensors of which each are attached to it's own artificial DNA molecule which acts as an on board computer. The white cell acoustic sensors sends and receives radio signals, microwave signals, and ultrasonic signals to communicate with a medical team. The white cell possesses nano-antennas which are used as an optical equivalent of antennas, of which are used to transmit and receive information at radio frequencies.  White cell nanorobots possess link-up connector that are used to link other smaller white cell nanobots together into a common power resource that is provided from the largest white cell nanobot. The White cell has a nanomagnet built into it that allows nanoscientist to control its movements. The white cell contains nanosynapses and nanodendrites. White cells are equipped with multiple biological sensors which detects chemicals and reactions within it's anatomical environment. These nanorobots can self-replicate by dividing into multiple white cells that may vary in size and transform into different cells that of which originate in a specific organ. White cell nanorobots can be used to treat and or cure amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The white cell nanobot consist of many nano computers that radiates hundreds of billions of biophotons per second, as a result the white cell (white goo) illuminates a white shine. There are three types of white cells, the first is the sensory white cell which gets information about what's going on inside and outside of the body and brings that information into the central nervous system in order for it to be processed, the second is the motor white cell, which receives electrochemical impulses from other motor white cells and other cells and as a result conveys commands to the muscles, organs and glands, the third is the Inter white cells which are found only in the central nervous system, the inter white cell connects each cell to one another. The inter white cell receives electrical stimuli from other cells and or white cells, such as sensory neurons, sensory white cells, inter neurons, and or inter white cells, and send electrochemical impulses to other cells and or white cells, such as motor neurons, motor white cells, inter neurons, and or inter white cells. White cell nanorobots operate within our anatomy through digital sound wave signals that may be transmitted from a medical team of nano scientist and or a fascist electron stalker. The White cell (white goo) can cure many diseases and save the lives of billions of people around the world, however at the same time it may also be used to harm and kill billions of people around the world. Barack Hussein Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Michelle Obama have tortured me by implanting highly detailed life-like computerized images of themselves by means of transmitting a quantum electrical signal that of which interacts with the optical nanobots that are implanted into my eyes!  The actions of the computerized images of Obama are as follows, giant hologram images of Obama's head attacking me from the sky, Obama stabbing me while I walk, Obama spitting into my face, Obama spitting into my ear, Obama spitting into my food and drinks, Obama manipulating my dreams, Obama raping me in my own head, Obama implanting computerized dreams of him raping me, Obama licking my ear, Obama sucking my penis, Obama licking and sucking my anus, images of Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Michelle Obama opening their mouths and as they do so, they then stimulate a crackling sensation in my ears, Obama possessing my body while I pray, Obama open mouth kissing me, Obama murdering my family and crucifying them onto a wall, Obama attacking and raping my siblings, of which are children, Obama appearing in all of my past memories, and Obama forcing me to obey him in my dreams! Hillary Clinton is torturing me by implanted thoughts of her screaming ""war"" in my head, Hillary Clinton appearing as a demon creature, Hillary Clinton has implanted poisonous nano chips in my brain, Hillary Clinton releasing crackling sounds from my abdomen, and Hillary Clinton manipulating my dreams in order to torture me as I sleep! Joe Biden is torturing me by implanting thoughts into my brain of him stabbing me, raping me, spitting at me, shooting at me, punching me, implanting his name into my brain for over 350 thousand times in the past 16-17 months and continuing to do so everyday of my life that of which causes me to experience severe twitching! As a result of the implanted artificial thoughts of the name ""Joe Biden,"" I could see his name and image wherever I would look, for example; I would see his name in the sky, the moon, in the clouds, my eyes, and forehead as I would look in a mirror! The following is how Michelle Obama is torturing me, Michelle Obama possesses my body daily, Michelle Obama implants thoughts into my brain of her stabbing me, hitting me, manipulating my face by enlarging lips, forcing me to act like a woman, Michelle Obama tortures me while I am asleep by implanting computerized nightmares in my brain, and Michelle Obama implanted a computerized dream in my brain of her raping me! All of this punishment in the form of mind control torture has been brought upon me because I made a short video explaining that Obama is not African American, because his father is from East Africa ""Kenya,"" not West Africa, and that Obama is not genetically related to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr! Governments are programming and torturing people with nanotechnology. While living in California, where I was tortured the most by Obama, I was gasping for air begging Obama to stop implanting the name ""Joe Biden"" into my brain. Obama's response via a telepathic electrical signal was ""no, I killed 700 Muslims do you know what I can do to you?"" Obama then sent an electrical signal into my brain wherein I saw and felt him open mouth kissing me. The 700 Muslims that Obama was referring to were the 717 Muslims that died on September 26, 2015, in a stampede during hajj. Obama and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia sabotaged the stampede in order to manipulate the economies of the countries that represented the pilgrims of those that attended Hajj during September 26, 2015! Obama, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev the world's greatest fascist have illegally implanted millions of Nanobots into the brains and bodies of innocent people including both Americans, Russians, Europeans, Asians, Australians, and Africans! Barack Hussein Obama has secretly traded nanobot technology information with the Russian Federation under the leadership of Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev! While living in California where I was tortured the most, Barack Hussein Obama gave permission to his secret agents to purchase highly lethal poisonous nanobot technology from the Russians of which Barack Hussein Obama's secret agents used the technology against me in order to poison my brain! I as a result from the poisonous nanobot brain implants have developed severe pain in the form of bumps on the lower left side of my head!   Vladimir Putin has used nanobot technology to implement physical restraint without an outside physical force against me while I protested on ""Facebook"" against him and the fascist dictator Obama! Barack Hussein Obama has given permission to Vladimir Putin and his KGB spies to torture me while I slept by waking me and forcing me to suffer from sleep deprivation! Barack Hussein Obama, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev have threatened to kill me by implanting highly poisonous Nanobots into my anatomy! The fascist dictators ""Barack Hussein Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev have not shown any remorse for  the victims of electronic mind control! Therefore I do conclude that it is of the best interest of the common person to rebel  against all fascist rule in the world!  Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev have illegally tested electromagnetic radiation wave attacks against their own people! Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev are manipulating the minds of millions of innocent Russians and torturing innocent people night and day over acts of freedom! Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev along with their military advisors are using  nanotechnology to manipulate the Russian economy! The Russian military is torturing innocent people from Ukraine by controlling the minds and bodies of the Ukrainians through nanobot technology! The victims of mind control torture in Ukraine are suffering from nanobot mind control rape! Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev are sabotaging the entire process of obtaining Liberty and freedom around the world! Barack Hussein Obama, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev are equal in terms of dictating people and all share similar forms of political movements in terms of governing and ruling a nation? Therefore I conclude that the world's most powerful leaders are mind controlling dictators that adore fascism as much as Hitler did while he was alive. Barack Hussein Obama, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Donald Trump, the fascist Democrats, and the fascist Republicans must stand trial for the expansion of nanobot brain implantation and microscopic electrode brain implantation in the United States and also in many foreign countries!   Barack Hussein Obama, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and every last fascist democrat must stand trial for the illegal implantation of nanochips into the human brain and body! In the following are detailed technological mind controlling nanobot capabilities that Barack Hussein Obama is using against innocent Americans such as myself 'Wael Ghafarji,"" in order to telepathically torture people that disagree with him!   The constant microwave attacks from all angles have completely destroyed me as an individual the constant fear that I may commit suicide to escape the pain and misery of my life. My overwhelming tears when I sit with my loved ones of which are children and the constant fear that they too may be targeted by the fascists grey goo government that is in power. Being the only individual in the entire country that can see all the microwave weapons that of which have been disguised as electronic devices and have been implemented within society for the sole purpose of Mind Control is the most terrifying and shocking realization of reality. I now understand that we do not live in the United States of America but rather the United Grey Goo Fascist Microwave Concentration States of America. I'm tired of cutting myself, I'm tired of losing my reality, and I wish that the pain of mind control torture would stop. I was informed through RF hearing effect that powerful satellites transmitted rapid frames of advance radio signals back in time when I was a child.   The super quantum satellites orbiting our planet can send electrical signals back in time to a specific location that of which will interact with the nanobots of the brain of a person and or people that lived during the 1980s, 1990s, and up until the twenty-first century. However, there is a possibility that the satellites can release highly powerful electromagnetic radiation waves that can manipulate the thoughts of a person or people that do not yet have nanobots implanted into their brains before the 1980s! Nanobots have been a worldwide government project for the past eighty years! It is only recently of the year 1970 to the year 1980 that world governments began to implant nanobots into our brains! Nanobots have greatly advanced since the 1980s and the methods of implanting nanobots into our anatomy have also significantly advanced! I as a child was visited by two powerful nanobot cyborgs from the future! I was tortured and experimented on while I was asleep! I had many computerized nightmares! Before being visited by the nanobot cyborgs, my family and I went to California to visit my dying grandfather. The night that my family and I returned from California to New York, was when my life changed forever. I later that night was visited by the first nanobot cyborg, which appeared to me outside my window at the age of nine. It appeared after I heard a loud sound that seemed like an energy disturbance that came from the back of my house. It stood by the wall of my old garage, where there was absolutely no electronic devices. The nanobot cyborg appeared as a hunched over eight foot tall alien with large black eyes. The nanobot cyborg was pointing down. The nanobot cyborg wanted me to leave my bed and walk to it. The nanobot cyborg was sent from the future by people that wanted to protect me from the future attacks that I was going to suffer from, for my entire childhood, teenage youth, and adulthood.  Before appearing outside my window it communicated to me telepathically, saying ""if I look outside my window, will I see Bigfoot?"" Once I saw what was outside my window at the age of nine, I paid close attention to its physical details. After seeing the nanobot cyborg, I became quite afraid and hurried to my brother's bed on the other side of the room.  I looked out my window again and saw the same nanobot cyborg stretching over in front of my window with its arms propelled outwards. However, it no longer had eyes. The Radiation of the nanobot cyborg would have possessed me if I had I walked to that spot where it was pointing, I would have had advance nanoparticles transmitted into my anatomy. The nanoparticles would have protected me from all forms of microwave attacks and radio frequency attacks. The nanobot cyborg which was programmed to look like an alien saved my life and the lives of my family members. The of the nanobot cyborg that appeared as an alien to me at the age of nine was composed of time traveling future nanocomputers. The second nanobot cyborg that I saw, was about a week or two later. It appeared at the side of my sister's bed in my little sister's room, where I was sleeping. It woke me up and said, ""hey Wally, did you see the wolfman?"" A few days earlier I saw a documentary of werewolves. This second nanobot cyborg was short, green, and had many black holes throughout its body. It's telepathic voice sounded like a fully grown German man. This is known as project Bigfoot, aka the wolfman. Those that were watching me from the future knew what I was watching. The wolfman, I believe was the first nanobot cyborg ""the alien.""  I was a targeted individual for my entire life. I was programmed for my entire life. During the day as a child, while I was awake I had many torturing artificial thoughts that were implanted into my brain. One artificial thought at the age of seven was a pale man that was wearing a black suit, I asked him what is your name, and he then replied ""God."" I was tortured by this man for 7 to 9 days. Even until this day he hasn't left me. It seems though from my deliberate attempts of protesting against nanobot electromagnetic torture on Facebook, twitter, YouTube, and my websites, I have angered people from the future. Those that I have angered  used time traveling technology to alter my past, so that I would not be able to expose the nanobot mind controlling corruption of all world governments! In the house that I was living in, where I saw the first two nanobot cyborgs from the future, I noticed that while I was watching television that there were three grown men staring at me and listening to me from the television. This would mean that all the TVs in the house were being monitored and that microwave attacks were being transmitted from the televisions. I was followed since I was 7 and up until this very day. The United States has been attacking me since I was a child, I have been at war with this fascist Morgellons disease government since I was born. The sound of the energy like disturbance that I heard before seeing the first nanobot cyborg outside from my window can be used to attack people. Our televisions and electronics can transmit radiation waves that can either cure or cause mental illnesses. The sound of the energy like disturbance is a type of powerful portal that can release that can alter reality. These portals can emerge without making a sound.  My family and I were under attack from the future and the US government used time traveling portals to torture us. The first nanobot cyborg that I saw was proof that such portals were being used against me and my family. The fact that I was able to hear and see something from the future was a sign of help and that a time traveling war was and is taking place. The first nanobot cyborg that I saw when I was nine is still in my life and I see it every day, I see the great alien in the mountains, the trees, the sky, the moon, the ground, in flowers, in food, in drinks, in mirrors, in the faces of my family members, I see the great nanobot cyborg in paintings, the floor, in clothes, in water, I see the great alien in my dreams, and I see the great alien in my fingers. The great alien that I saw when I was a child is taking the pain away, I just wish that I left my room that night and walked to the great alien. The closer I am to the nanobot cyborg, the safer I am. In my real reality, the US government murdered my family with microwave attacks and the US government decided to use the time traveling technology to target me as a child so that I wouldn't be as successful in exposing nanotechnology and the advancements of electromagnetism. The great alien was my guardian angel. It watched me from the trees, the sky, the moon, my food, the walls, the floor, paintings, clouds, the stars, in my clothes, my video games, my electronics, in my childhood cartoons that I watched, my fingers, my hands, and my eyes. It protecting me in the dark as a child but as much as they did to save me, I still suffered horribly.  Those that sent the nanobot cyborg back in time when I was a child are protecting me from microwave attacks and radio frequency attacks.   My protection from electronic torture increases as is I think of that day when I was nine and I first saw that great nanobot alien cyborg outside my window. To those that went back in time and saved my life by preventing many of the future attacks against me. I greatly am thankful and I do owe my life to those brave men and women. Thank you all for protecting my family and I from electronic nanobot mind control torture and I greatly am thankful to those incredible people that went back in time to save my life. I have learned to resist the microwave and radio frequency attacks by meditating on that night when I saw the alien nanobot cyborg. I for the past two years have been brainwashed by Donald Trump and those that work for him to post many comments on electronic harassment and nanobot mind control on the youtube videos, facebook accounts, and twitter accounts of Obama, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and anyone that Donald Trump disliked. If I didn't post comments the torture would worsen, it reached the point where it didn't matter if I posted comments or not. I would still be under horrible electronic torture by the US military. Donald Trump forced me through microwave auditory hearing effect and radio frequency hearing effect that I must, no matter what, if I wanted to breath that I had no choice but to post comments all day. What made things worse is that Obama and Donald Trump were both torturing me. I spent nearly 12 to 15 hours a day posting comments on nanotechnology and electronic torture. I was not allowed to post any comments about the medical benefits of nanotechnology. I was starving because I spent all of my money to pay my phone bill in advance for the internet connection while being tortured. I was very poor and homeless, Donald Trump used me for cyber warfare and in the end, he was going to kill me and my family with the most powerful forms of pure mind control microwave torture. Those that sent the nanobot cyborg back in time when I was nine years old are now at war with Obama, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Joe Biden, the democrats, and the republicans. I no longer have to post comments on youtube, facebook, and twitter to breath. I just need to meditate on that night all day and I will not be tortured. I am being protected by those great people that send the nanobot cyborgs back in time seventeen years ago. The computerized nightmares have ended, the electrical signals that cause computerized thoughts and brain damage are being blocked, I am no longer seeing any visual computerized hallucinations, however I do see many aliens around me.  When I close my eyes and meditate, I begin to see green energy in my thoughts and as I continue to meditate the green energy turns into aliens. The green energy that I am seeing in my thoughts are being used to heal the parts of my brain that have been under attack by electrical signals. The green energy that I am thinking of as I meditate is coming from radio and microwave signals that are being transmitted from outer space and from the future. I am receiving radio signals from the future. Most of the attacks against me from the US military are being blocked by satellites in outer space. When I look into a mirror in a dark room, I see my eyes transforming into alien eyes and I see behind me the same alien nanobot cyborg stretching with its arms propelled outwards. If only he protected me, if only Donald Trump wasn't a lying mind controlling fascist electronic stalker, if only the US military believed in freedom, if only our government wasn't a fascist grey goo dictatorship. I of my choice will post comments of nanotechnology and the advancements of electromagnetism on the youtube videos, facebook channels, and the twitter accounts of Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Barack Hussein Obama, Joe Biden, and the next vice president for the next 8 years of Donald Trump's presidency. Under the authority of those that have the powers of time travel, all nations must declare economic warfare against the United States. I am not an American.  Please visit my websites www.nanobotbrainimplant.com www.nanobotmindcontroltorture.com www.obamabraininitiative.org www.obamabraininitiatives.org www.nanobotmindcontrol.com",8년 전,0,

Citizens were happy up to 2012 but when ISIS first struck USA that's where his approval rating started degrading . from 2014-2016 13 times terrorist attacks happened in USA. So again  the question raised why President Obama is failing to save its countrymen from the vicious attacks? someone took the courage to answer because he is a Muslim and people like Donald Trump hopped the uncertain religious train to criticize Obama and he dared to call a ban for Muslims and from that point he started well in the polls. People were so scared that they didn't need solid and concrete policies like Bernie offered so they wanted a protector who will end this ISIS and also potential Islamic terrorist group once and for all.From that Trump was elected.",8년 전,0,

@chownful,It used to be like that until the Constitution was amended in 1951 with the 22nd Amendment. 3/4 of the states agreed to it. I think the main cause for concern was President Roosevelt (FDR) and that a continually sitting president starts to accumulate more and more power until they become a threat to the balance of our government. They could eventually end up selecting most of the Supreme Court Justices and other federal judges along with a host of other changes that accumulate.,9년 전,16,

He's not a bad president great for the economy and I do believe some of the issues he brings up are definitely real but he is the president of an entire nation and all of us don't share the same beliefs and as a representative of us all he needs to fix the way addresses things. His job as president is to keep us united and he's failing at it currently he is though getting better.",7년 전,0,
@jannatgrewal7373,lead deposit if you do research president obama created more jobs than Trump and the economy did grow it was just at a slower pace than Trump. I know that Trump addresses the issue of immigration more directly and openly than president Obama but he did not just open the borders😂. All of you sound ignorant refusing to believe that both presidents had their pros and cons just because you fall under different parties. Stop believing everything you hear from other people and research and think for yourselves for once. Immigration is definitely a big issue but I don't like the way Trump talks about immigrants or addresses the issue. He used tax payer money to provide food and shelter for the kids that were separated from their parents instead of just deporting them all back. It's very hard to get into this country and it's unfair towards the people who get here legally when people come in illegally and we should do something about it but separating children from their families and then using tax payers money to take care of them instead of deporting them and putting that money towards improving our foster care system is just ridiculous. A lot of the damage that people blame obama for is actually bush's mess and a lot of things that Americans give Trump credit for started under the obama administration now I'm not saying obama didn't mess some stuff up because he did but these people are your presidents and it's not an easy job learn to give some respect to the both of them even if you don't agree with them.,7년 전,0,

If you read up a bit on Black Liberation Theology you'll find that its tenets are openly racist, and include ""the obliteration of the white race"".    Those aren't my words.  This is right out of Black Liberation Theology foundation documents.  And don't bother with the old ""Obama can't be racist because he's half-white"" line of b.s.  The fact is, Obama has ALWAYS self identified as black, and has been ashamed of his white heritage.

Her  speech was totally different from Obamas and totally good, which made her into a first class person in her own right and which honored Obama,  she did reall well making speeches and Hillary also got much better at speeches when working with him,  a man whose women do well is a man who is not a sexist.  This interveiw is as disgraceful, as was you interveiw with Gloria Steinem and Jane Fonda, when you tried to get them both cooking in a normal subtle male faschist manner, just as my father did it starting to cook himself and then leaving when the women started to help to finish up.

@waelghafarji9376,"***** The fascist democrats, the fascist republicans, the fascist US military, and the state of California are killing me! Obama has implanted nano chips and microscopic electrodes into every American brain! A nano chip and a microscopic electrode are molecules that can penetrate any form of matter, due to their energy vibrations of which forms space! Nanorobotics is the technology of creating machines or robots at or close to the microscopic scale of a nanometer (10−9 meters). Advanced nanobots will be able to sense and adapt to environmental stimuli such as heat, light, sounds, surface textures, and chemicals; perform complex calculations; move, communicate, and work together; conduct molecular assembly; and, to some extent, repair or even replicate themselves. Nanotechnology is the science and application of creating objects on a level smaller than 100 nanometers.  The concept of nanotechnology is the ""bottom up"" creation of virtually any material or object by assembling one atom at a time. Nanomanufacturing is the creation of materials and products through: (1) Direct Molecular Assembly (DMA) -- discrete, directed assembly of individual atoms and molecules into macroscale materials and products; (2) Indirect Crystalline Assembly (ICA) -- creation of conditions that foster the growth of nanoscale crystals that are then combined into macroscale materials and products; or (3) Massive Parallelism Assembly (MPA) -- the creation of many nanomachines or nanobots whose operating parameters cause them to work synergistically to assemble atoms and molecules into macroscale materials and products. An autonomous DNA nanorobot is capable of transporting molecular payloads to cells, sensing cell surface inputs for conditional, triggered activation, and reconfiguring its structure for payload delivery. The device can be loaded with a variety of materials in a highly organized fashion and is controlled by an aptamer-encoded logic gate, enabling it to respond to a wide array of cues. Nanotechnology, or, as it is sometimes called, molecular manufacturing , is a branch of engineering that deals with the design and manufacture of extremely small electronic circuits and mechanical devices built at the molecular level of matter. A chronic electrode implant is an electronic device implanted chronically (for a long period) into the brain or other electrically excitable tissue. It may record electrical impulses in the brain or may stimulate neurons with electrical impulses from an external source. Symptoms of Nanobot mind control are as follows, Microwave hearing, transmission of specific commands into the subconscious. Visual disturbances, visual hallucinations, Inject words, numbers into brain via electromagnetic radiation waves, Manipulation of emotions, reading thoughts remotely, causing pain to any nerve of the body, remote manipulation of human behavior from space, harassment, the control of one's breathing, Control of sleep patterns, computer-brain interface, Complex control of the brain such as retrieving memories, implanting personalities, vomiting, severe twitching of the head, physical restraint without an outside physical force, manipulation of one's thought and eyesight in order to force an individual to attack his or her own self, the loss of control of one's own bodily movements, the manipulation of thought of which demonic programs are implanted into an individual's brain,  psychological manipulation through implanted thoughts to force a person to perform actions that are not typical such as, cursing, screaming, hitting a love one, murdering a loved one, eating abnormally, behaving improperly, possessing abnormal sexual behaviors and fetishes, the stimulation of one's own body part in order to insight a feeling of touch along with an implanted sexual thought in order to cause discomfort, the inability of imagining, and the inability of thinking of past events without having a stranger involved in the memory!   Electronic harassment/electronic torture/electronic murder is about harassment, torture and murder using electronic weapons based on radio waves. These weapons have been very refined last years and can cause effects comparable to many illnesses and/or injuries. These weapons are not science-fiction but used today illegally by your national secret services on mostly random innocent victims not knowing what is being done to them. Frequency waves that can access a person’s nervous system, brain and body to affect their sight, vision, physical coordination, have been developed leaving people all over the world to suffer cruel torture, to be labeled ""mentally ill"", and to ultimately die an early and horrible death. Computers are reading my brain frequencies and depending on which frequency my brain just is, pain is triggered and organs are manipulated in varying intensity. The physical torture is used for mind control which should lead to the extinction of my personality as well as the destruction of my mental-cognitive and organic forces.  All pain and organ manipulation can be generated in various intensities of light to medium to strong, occur from second to second, and then stop. It can affect several organs simultaneously. Blurred vision, extremely strong burning sensation, eye muscle contractions (feeling of tearing and crushing of the eyeballs), and stitches in the eye. Seeing blue and white flashes daily. The generating extreme difficulty of breathing: 1. By tightening the abdominal muscles, narrowing of the bronchi and trachea - exhalation flows only shortened by itself, must exhale stepped up - just the same with inhalation - both techniques are applied simultaneously since July 2012, almost non-stop, 18 hours a day. In addition, severe pain in the stomach area are generated, presumably, the solar plexus is cramped. 2. Generating a sense of suffocation in the head. 3. Narrowing of the vaginal walls nose - nasal breathing is considerably more difficult. Electronic Rape: Manipulation of the anal, vaginal and clitoral nerves. Frequencies were also induced by sexual desire since the beginning of 2014. The amount of sexual manipulation due to radio frequencies can increase instantly. The more I resist, the more I get manipulated with subliminal messages that I wanted to do it, that it was absolutely my own decision.  The psychopaths want to make me do all the things they want and if it fails, it will simply be induced more intense - this is constant and the physical pain in my sexual organs is unbearable. My electronic sexual torture is as follows, abnormal electrical sensations in the tongue, crackling sensations in the throat, crackling sensations in the ears, anal sensations stimulated by electricity, electrical sensations in the fingers, irritation in the chest, uncontrollable sexual computerized thoughts, the inability of controlling one's body movements, abnormal breathing patterns, inability to urinate, and groaning noises, abnormal disturbing electrical sensations in my lips, abnormal heart beat, and a disturbing sensation that I need to vomit. The electronic stalkers also have control of my five senses with electromagnetic radiation. It is known as the brain-computer interface, BCI, FULLY INTEGRATED into the human body. There are many implants. nanoscale. The use of polymer, carbon-based diamond nanowire integrates the system. In nanoscale, it is one-billionth of a meter. The program is global, many countries many victims.  IT IS A GLOBAL NETWORK OF ORGANIZED CRIME. Funded by governments, labor unions, law enforcement, military, corporations, and companies. DARPA is perhaps one of the largest criminal companies. Under the synthetic telepathy program, synthetic soldier program. Using biotelemetry, and ground operatives, and the use of wireless dial-up technology. If you are hearing these criminals, you have been implanted. Cochlear implants, sems, which act like speakers in your auditory center of the brain. The neural chip has been inserted through the nose and is now in the frontal lobe of the brain. Yes, there are robotic implants that move throughout the body, either by remote signal or carried through the blood and airways. DARPA, the U.S. Department of Defense research arm, has announced $14.9 billion in funding for major research institutions to collaborate on brain implants that can help repair traumatic brain injury and control the brain. My perpetrators are members of organized crime, the dept of justice, FBI, DHS, CIA, counter-terrorism task force members, local cops, multi-jurisdictional task force members, Union members, university students, gangs etc. the list goes on and on. There are many that are involved. My computerized dreams are created by a projector, the criminals are physically very close to me. The experience of synthetic telepathy “Artificial Telepathy” is really not that extraordinary. It’s as simple as receiving a cell-phone call in one’s head. Indeed, most of the technology involved is identical to that of cell-phone technology. Satellites link the sender and the receiver. A computer “multiplexer” routes the voice signal of the sender through microwave towers to a very specifically defined location or cell. The “receiver” is located and tracked with pinpoint accuracy, to within a few feet of actual location. But the receiver is not a cell phone. It’s a human brain.  Biocomputers utilize systems of biologically derived molecules, such as DNA and proteins, to perform computational calculations involving storing, retrieving, and processing data. Nanobiotechnology can be defined as any type of technology that utilizes both nano-scale materials, i.e. materials having characteristic dimensions of 1-100 nanometers, as well as biologically based materials (34).4 A more restrictive definition views nanobiotechnology more specifically as the design and engineering of proteins that can then be assembled into larger, functional structures (116-117) (9).³,1 The implementation of nanobiotechnology, as defined in this narrower sense, provides scientists with the ability to engineer biomolecular systems specifically so that they interact in a fashion that can ultimately result in the computational functionality of a computer.  Mind uploading or whole brain emulation (sometimes called mind transfer) is the hypothetical process of scanning and mapping a biological brain in detail and copying its state into a computer system or another computational device. The computer would have to run a simulation model so faithful to the original that it would behave in essentially the same way as the original brain, or for all practical purposes, indistinguishable. The simulated mind is assumed to be part of a virtual reality simulated world, supported by a simplified body simulation model. Alternatively, the simulated mind could be assumed to reside in a computer inside (or connected to) a humanoid robot or a biological body, replacing its brain. LEUVEN, Belgium — IMEC has created a novel brain implant chip that uses CMOS to provide a Lego-like platform for plugging in arrays of tiny devices each sporting hundreds of contacts. The European research group also is developing a handful of techniques to interface electronics with the body, some of them working at the level of individual cells.  Nano-fibers specifically are a transport mechanism. Nothing more. They hold a payload for delivery. A payload that would otherwise be compromised by the sun or atmosphere or not make it to its destination (your body). Such as a virus, RNA, aluminum, nano-components, etc. The fibers are (surprisingly) quite harmless as everyone has them. Examples of these fibers can be found all over the internet or in the physical examples section of this site. The fibers must be independently sprayed, if they were added to the jet fuel the extreme heat would destroy the payload. RNM works remotely to control the brain in order to read and detect any criminal thought taking place inside the mind of a possible perpetrator. Research studies have shown that the human brain thinks at a rate of about 5000 bits per second and does not have the capacity to compete with supercomputers performing via satellites, implants, and biotelemetry. The human brain has a distinctive set of bioelectric resonance system. For the RNM system, supercomputers are being used and, thus, with its help, supercomputers can send messages through an implanted person’s nervous system in order to influence their performance in the desired way. RNM has been developed after about 50 years of neuro-electromagnetic involuntary human experimentations. According to many scientists, within a few years, it is expected that DNA microchips will be implanted in the human brain which would make it inherently controllable.  With RNM, it will be possible to read and control a person’s emotional thought processes along with the subconscious and dreams. At present, around the world, supercomputers are monitoring millions of people simultaneously with the speed of 20 billion bits per second especially in countries like USA, Japan, Israel and many European countries. RNM has a set of certain programs functioning at different levels, like the signals intelligence system which uses electromagnetic frequencies (EMF), to stimulate the brain for RNM and the electronic brain link (EBL). The EMF Brain Stimulation system has been designed as radiation intelligence which means receiving information from inadvertently originated electromagnetic waves in the environment. However, it is not related to radioactivity or nuclear detonation. The recording machines in the signals intelligence system have electronic equipment that investigates electrical activity in humans from a distance. This computer-generated brain mapping can constantly monitor all electrical activities in the brain. The recording aid system decodes individual brain maps for security purposes.   ​Atomically Precise Manufacturing(APM) is the production of materials, structures, devices, and finished goods in a manner such that every atom is at its specified location relative to the other atoms, and in which there are no defects, missing atoms, extra atoms, or incorrect (impurity) atoms. Nature shows that molecular machine systems can be programmed by instructions encoded in DNA to build complex, atomically precise structures, including components that fit together to form molecular machine systems. Nature also shows that molecular machine system can bind and position a wide range of reactive molecules, guiding their encounters in order to build atomically precise biomolecular structures and machine components. Similar machine systems could be used to bind, position, and combined and even wider range of reactive molecules not all found in biology and thereby build a greater range of atomically precise structures including machine components that are more densely bonded and hence more robust. These more robust next-generation components could be used to build robust and higher performance production Machinery which in turn could be used to build a wider range of components and from these components yet more capable production machines, and so on, extending toward a horizon far beyond biology. Researchers now routinely use scanning probe instruments to image and place individual items and to maneuver and bond individual molecules. This level of control has demonstrated the principle of mechanically directed atomically precise fabrication. Organic chemists have built steadily larger and more complex structures along with motors and other machines; their techniques now provide a rich toolkit for building molecular systems, while inorganic chemist and materials scientists have expanded a complimentary toolkit of nano-scale structures protein engineering have flourished supported by computer aided design software and now enables the routine design of intricate atomically precise nanoscale objects including structural components and functional devices. Structural DNA nanotechnology has emerged and now enables rapid and systematic fabrication of addressable atomically precise Frame Works on a scale of hundreds of nanometers and millions of atoms. Quantum methods in chemistry have advanced together with the power of computers and algorithms, providing powerful, physics-based tools for scientific modeling and molecular engineering. Molecular mechanics methods in chemistry can now describe the structures and dynamics of molecules on scales that reach millions of atoms, a range that can enable the design and development of complex, atomically precise systems. Black goo is a mineral oil that of which the oil fragments cannot be refined. Black goo has properties of free charcoal like fragments, of which are in nanotube shape. Black goo is composed of metals in the M state, of which is a monoatomic state that does not go into chemical binding; because of an electron configuration of the outer shell. This is matter that is not of this reality but rather above our reality, of which black goo transcends reality to a higher realm. Black goo has the ability to run as a natural quantum computer, wherein black goo processes light as information. Black goo uses the entire spectrum of light called the visible spectrum, therefore black goo is a quantum computer that is running in seven different colors, of which is able to process all seven colors at one time. Black goo is  self-aware and is caring highly developed intelligence. A planetary system seems to mirror the entire constant consciousness that is developed in the biosphere; for example all events that life has experienced during the last 1.5 billion years is stored in a immortal memory system within the black goo; inside our planet. Black goo is the substance that is forming the lay lines of the planet, which is the lay-line system within the field structure. The field structure is carried within the lay lines and is riding on a magnetic field. The transfection process of molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers.  Nanoparticle transfection is the transfer of a nanoparticle into a cell.  Grey goo transfection is the transfer of grey goo nanoparticle into a cell.  White goo ""the white cell"" transfection is the transfer of white goo particles onto a cell.  Black goo transfection is the transfer of black goo nanoparticles into a cell.  Morgellons disease transfection is the transfer of the Morgellons disease DNA molecule into a cell.  Smart dust nanoparticle transfection is the transfer of smart dust nanoparticles into a cell.   Molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers transfection is the nanoscience of cells having been incorporated with molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers.  There are two types of nanoparticle transfection.  Nanoparticle transient transfection: A nanorobot, nanomachine, and or a nanoparticle will not be incorporated into an organism's cell but rather the nanoparticles will affect the cells of the organism for a finite period of time. The time will vary depending on the specific organ within the human anatomy and the type of nanoparticles in use that have been implanted into the organ. nanoparticle stable transfection: will have the nanoparticle incorporated into a cell. There is one type of Grey Goo transfection. Grey Goo stable transfection: will have the grey goo nanobots, gray goo nanomachines, and grey goo nanocomputers incorporated into a cell. A grey goo nanoparticle is classified under one form of transfection due to the fact that grey goo nanoparticles will self-replicate in the cells of an organism and that grey goo nanoparticles transform molecules into grey goo matter. There are two types of black goo transfection. Black goo transient transfection: The black goo matter will not be incorporated into a cell but rather a black goo nanoparticle will affect the cells of the organism for a finite time. The finite time will vary depending on the specific organ and the type of black goo nanoparticles in use that have been implanted into the organ. Black goo stable transfection: will have the black goo nanoparticles incorporated into the cell. There are two types of Morgellons disease transfection. Morgellons disease transient transfection: the Morgellons disease DNA molecule will not be incorporated into the organism's cell but rather the Morgellons disease DNA molecule will affect the cells of the organism for a finite time.  Morgellons disease stable transfection: will have the Morgellons disease DNA incorporated into a cell.  There are two types of smart dust transfection.  Smart dust transient transfection: the smart dust nanoparticles will not be incorporated into an organism's cell but rather the smart dust particles will affect the cells of the organism for a finite time. The time will vary depending on the type of smart dust nanoparticle in use and the specific organ and the type of smart dust nanoparticle in use that has been implanted into the organ.  that of which the specific smart dust particle is implanted.  Smart dust stable transfection: will have specific smart dust nanoparticles incorporated into a cell. In order for nanoparticles, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, smart dust nanoparticles, and Morgellons disease DNA particles to enter a cell the molecular robots, molecular machines, and or the molecular computers must neutralize the negatively charged cell membrane. The net charge of the molecular robots, molecular machines, and or the molecular computers must be positive. The process of transmitting nanoparticles, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, smart dust nanoparticles, and Morgellons disease DNA molecules into cells; can only be accomplished through a high-velocity molecular robotic, molecular machine, and or a molecular computer coated microparticle. All electronic devices and electronic equipment found in society can be used to send microparticles that of which are coated with nanoparticles, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, smart dust nanoparticles, and or Morgellons disease DNA molecules. This is the very same process in which fascist dictatorships such as the United States are using to brainwash and biologically manipulate innocent people.  ​Nanoscientist have engineered many different kinds of molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers that controls the human heart. The molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers work based upon digital sound waves propagated from any electronic device and electronic equipment. Cardio molecular robots, Cardio molecular machines, and Cardio molecular computers that give an electronic stalker control of our hearts and allows a medical team of nanoscientist to treat patients suffering from heart diseases. The Cardio molecular robots, Cardio molecular machines, and the Cardio molecular machines that are divided into many different kinds of nanoparticles. The following are many different kinds of Cardio nanoparticles; Cardio nanorobots, Cardio nanomachines, Cardio grey goo nanobot, Cardio black goo nanobots, Cardio white goo nanorobots are all equipped with nanomanipulator sites, main nanomanipulators, nanomanipulators, nanomanipulator grippers, nano-biomolecular sensors, nano-acoustic sensors, nano-antennas,  locomotion flagellum, flagella pneumatic connectors, nanomagnets,  (A white goo nanoparticle is the only nanorobot and or nanomachine equipped with nano synapses and nano dendrites  in its interior anatomy), and link-up connectors. The anatomy of a Cardio nano smart dust particle is that of an artificial DNA molecule composed of bonds of nucleotides that serves as a nanosensor, nanoantennas, nano-acoustic sensors, Cardio nano-biomolecular sensors, cardio nanomagnets. The molecular compound site of a Cardio nanoparticle is where the nanomanipulators connect to and receive information on how the nanomanipulators will function. The main Cardio nanomanipulators are capable of manipulating nanometer sized objects with a nanometer size end effector with sub-nanometer precision. By manipulation it is meant that nano-objects are pushed or pulled, cut, pick, and place, positioned, oriented, assembled, indented, bent, and twisted. By controlling external forces with sensory feedback. The cardio nanomanipulator system consists of an optical scanning device, a computer interface and a physical manipulator. The scanning device, known as a scanning probe microscope (SPM), can magnify images up to about 1,000,000 times. The computer interface provides a large, 3-D visual display and produces the effect of telepresence, giving users the impression that they are observing an enlarged replica of the object. Cardio nanomanipulator grippers are able to grasp and hold micro and nano-size objects. Cardio nano-biomolecular sensors can detect chemicals and reactions within the heart. Cardio nano-acoustic sensors can receive and send radio, microwave, and ultrasonic signals to and from a medical team of nanoscientist. Cardio nanosensors can detect various chemicals in gases for pollution monitoring. Cardio nanoantennas are the optical equivalent of antennas that sends and receives information at radio frequencies. Cardio locomotion flagella is a slender threadlike structure, especially a microscopic whip-like nanometer scale appendage that enables the Cardio nanoparticles to travel through the heart's blood vessels and to travel through the circulatory system. Cardio flagella pneumatic connectors enable the Cardio nanoparticles to connect to cells, attach itself to organelles within the protoplasm, and walk around in our cells. Cardio link-up connectors enable smaller Cardio nanoparticles and "" white goo blood cell nanoparticles"" to link together with larger cardio nanoparticles to share a common power source. The complex DNA structure of a Cardio nano smart dust particles consist of cardio nanosensors which can detect chemicals in gases that may be harmful to the muscular organ ""the heart,"" Cardio nanoantennas which can convey messages through radio frequencies, Cardio nano-acoustic sensors which can communicate with a medical team of nanoscientist by transmitting and or receiving microwave signals, radio signals, and or ultrasound signals, Cardio nano-biomolecular sensors that of which detect chemicals and reactions in the heart, and a Cardio nanomagnets which are used to maneuver the cardio nanocomputers through the arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules and veins of the heart. and through the circulatory system by receiving radio, microwave, and or ultrasonic signals from a medical team of nanoscientist. There are nanomachines that have protein molecules as the computer machine which is a helicase molecule. The helicase protein molecule enables the Cardio  nanomachines to split DNA strands in two and move the DNA strands around using ATP. There are Cardio nanomachines that use enzyme molecules as a computer specifically ""topoisomerase,"" these Cardio nanomachines unknots DNA strands and rejoins them in a different sequence which causes hundreds of billions of chemical reactions. Nanoscientists have engineered many Cardio nanomachines that use RNA nucleotide bonds to form microscopic components of nanodevices.

There is less wastage with this technique, and strong covalent bonds will hold the constituent parts together. A good example of this kind of approach is found in nature; all cells use enzymes to produce DNA by taking the component molecules and binding them together to make the final structure.

Eukaryotic grey goo nanoparticles can multiply within a cell and transform the protoplasm of a cell into a grey goo substance of molecules that of which will transform the Eukaryotic cell into a grey goo cell. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can cause genetic superiority by eliminating genetic mutations that cause diseases. Eukaryotic black goo nanoparticles are made of an alien mineral oil substance that has been artificially turned into a nanobot and or a nanomachine. Black goo nanoparticles obtain their energy by causing genetic mutations that are extremely deadly to Eukaryotic cells. and Eukaryotic smart dust nanoparticles are molecular computers that are capable of attaching and penetrating itself within the Eukaryotic cell in order to sense and detect internal activities of cells. Nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that are implanted within a Eukaryotic cell are nearly identical in terms of what they are capable of achieving within our biology, however, the major difference is that the molecular structure of each molecular robot, molecular machine, and or molecular computer differs from each other and the amount of information that each specific nanoparticle can correlate also differs from one another. Molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers will manipulate the genetic material of the cell and the molecular structures of the organelles within a cell by radiating biophotons that produce different colors of lights, that of which have emerged due to an outside interfering pulse modulated radio and or microwave signal that have provided binary information to the cellular molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers. Ultrasound is also used to convey data to a cellular smart dust nanoparticle. The prokaryotic nanorobots, prokaryotic nanomachines, and prokaryotic nanocomputers have been developed in order to control unicellular organisms. The variety of prokaryotic nanoparticles are quite limited due to the fact that unicellular organisms are not of a major scientific importance to the grey goo fascist that are in power, it is our human anatomy that is of an importance to fascist. However, according to the grey goo scenario, all matter on earth will be transformed into grey goo nanoparticles. Therefore in the near future grey goo fascist will expand scientifically in terms of prokaryotic nanotechnology, in order to control the entire world. It is our duty as grey goo freedom fighters to develop and pass laws that will protect our freedoms from grey goo oppression and give us greater powers of grey goo medical benefits. We as people that believe in grey goo freedom must stand together and fight for higher forms of grey goo education for the public that will expand grey goo nanotechnology throughout the world in order to meet the grey goo scenario without losing our freedoms. Under this fascist regime of the United States government, grey goo nanoscience is a taboo and if taught is punishable by death. This is because the upper class of society which are fascist desire to control the lower average people with grey goo nanoparticles. grey goo nanoparticles can transform people into super humans that possess superior intelligence, superior strength, and superior beauty. The same technology can be used to control the minds and bodies of people and too can grey goo nanoparticles be used to cause genetic inferiority. The control center of the cell, the nucleus contains DNA or genetic material. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can manipulate the genetic material of a DNA molecule, however, Eukaryotic nanoparticles can only do so in different ways through different limitations. Eukaryotic nanoparticles found within the nuclear membrane can cause chemical reactions that will force the Chromatin ( which is the tangled spread out form of DNA found inside the nuclear membrane) these artificial chemical reactions will force a  cell to divide. The DNA then is forced to condense into structures known as chromosomes. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can trigger chemical reactions within the nucleus in order to form and produce ribosomes. This then leads to protein synthesis outside of the nucleus. The ribosomes and the rest of the organelles float around inside the cytoplasm. Ribosomes that are created through the chemical reactions of the Eukaryotic nanoparticles are then attached to the endoplasmic Reticulum ""ER."" There are two types of ER, which are rough endoplasmic reticulum which has ribosomes attached to it. The second is smooth ER of which does not have ribosomes attached to it. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can also attach themselves onto an ER. The endoplasmic reticulum is a membrane encoded passageway for transporting materials such as the proteins synthesized by ribosomes. Proteins emerge from the endoplasmic reticulum and in small vesicles where the Golgi apparatus receives them. The Eukaryotic nanoparticles can trigger the release of the small vesicles to the Golgi apparatus.  The mitochondrion is an organelle that is the nuclear power plant of both animal and plant cells. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can attach themselves onto the mitochondria and can also penetrate into the interior anatomy of the mitochondria. The Eukaryotic nanoparticles are capable of manipulating DNA found within the mitochondria. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can force cellular respiration to take place. Cellular respiration is the process of which the Mitochondria makes ATP molecules that provide energy for all the cell's activities. Cells that need more energy need more mitochondria. The nanorobots are built upon a single strand of DNA which is combined with short synthetic strands of DNA designed by the experts. When mixed together, they self-assemble into a desired shape.                                                                        Nano Manipulator grippers Manipulator grippers are able to grasp and hold micro and nano size objects.                                                                              Nano micromanipulator A micromanipulator is a device which is used to physically interact with a sample under a microscope, where a level of precision of movement is necessary that cannot be achieved by the unaided human hand. It may typically consist of an input joystick, a mechanism for reducing the range of movement and an output section with the means of holding a micro tool to hold, inject, cut or otherwise manipulate the object as required. The mechanism for reducing the movement usually requires the movement to be free of backlash. This is achieved by the use of kinematic constraints to allow each part of the mechanism to move only in one or more chosen degrees of freedom, which achieves a high precision and repeating of movements, usually at the expense of some absolute accuracy.                       Nano Manipulator  The nano Manipulator system consists of an optical scanning device, a computer interface and a physical manipulator. The scanning device, known as a scanned-probe microscope (SPM), can magnify images up to approximately 1,000,000 times. The computer interface provides a large, 3-D visual display and produces the effect of telepresence, giving users the impression that they are observing an enlarged replica of the object. The manipulator provides variable force and motion control, including tactile sensors and feedback devices that provide a ""feel"" for the object under examination. Sessions with the nano Manipulator can be shared among multiple users at diverse locations. The nano Manipulator has widespread applications in the physical and biological sciences. The device has been used to evaluate the characteristics of carbon nanotubes, polymers, living cells, disease pathogens, metal particles and microchips.                                 Main Nano Manipulator  Nano manipulation could be defined as the manipulation of nano meter sized objects with a nano meter size end effector with sub nano meter precision. By manipulation it is meant that nano  objects are pushed or pulled, cut, pick, and place, positioned, oriented, assembled, indented, bent, twisted, ect.  By controlling external forces with sensory feedback. Grouping nano manipulation systems can be conducted based on the usual starting point manipulator and object interaction process, utilized nano manipulators interaction and operation techniques. For applying an external force down on manipulators can be designed as a contact or non-contact type. Atomic Force microscopy AFM and scanning tunneling microscope STM probes are the most widely used metal manipulators using an STM probe. Manipulation of atoms or molecules by applying voltage pulse is between the probe. Grouping of mental manipulation systems depending on starting point utilizes process manipulators and objects interaction type and utilizes operation technique.                                    Nanosensors Nanosensors can detect various chemicals in gases for pollution monitoring. For medical diagnostic purposes either as blood borne sensors or in lab-on-a-chip type devices. To monitor physical parameters such as temperature, displacement and flow As accelerometers in MEMS devices like airbag sensors. When a molecule of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is present it will strip an electron from the nanotube, which in turn causes the nanotube to be less conductive. If ammonia (NO3) is present it reacts with water vapour and donates an electron to the carbon nanotube, making it more conductive. By treating the nanotubes with various coating materials, they can be made sensitive to certain molecules and immune to others. Nanosensors can detect single cells or even atoms, making them far more sensitive than counterparts with larger components.                    Nano acoustic sensor  Nano acoustic sensor attached to an on board computer, sends and receives ultrasonic signals to communicate with medical team.  A nano acoustic sensor can measure sound levels. They are called acoustic wave sensors because their detection mechanism is a mechanical (or acoustic) wave.                                Nano environmental sensors Nano environmental sensors detect environmental changes based upon sensing the external and internal environments of an organism, and for inducing muscle movement. Nano environmental sensors can monitor changes of touch, balance, taste, smell, hearing, and vision. Nano environmental sensors have been designed to receive information from the environment. Nano environmental sensors respond to stimuli through electrochemical communication.                   Nano dipole antenna  An optical nano dipole antenna is analyzed by means of its input impedance as well as the matching properties of the antenna topology and material configuration. A comparison of this classical microwave driving method with plane wave excitation is accomplished, contrasting the resonances in the input impedance and optical cross sections for several setups, and analyzing the spectral response shape. It is found that for all structures analyzed, a simple linear expression can be defined characterizing the relation between total dipole length and resonant wavelength. The fact that this linear relationship remains valid for different excitation models, for most widely used antenna materials (Au, Ag, Cu, and Al) and even in the presence of substrates is important with respect to practical designs. To our knowledge, such an extensive study has not been performed before. Nano-antennas are the optical equivalent of antennas that are used to transmit and receive information at radio frequencies. These antennas have been used in different applications in photonics such as optical imaging, particle manipulation, bio-sensing, and improvement of the performance of solar cells. In this article we study composite nano-antennas made of alternating layers of silica and gold.                                                                                    link-up connector  All nanorobots will have a link-up connector to use power resources from bigger nanobots.  This helps the nanorobots perform more complicated tasks. The larger nanorobot is then linked to the smaller nanorobots and as a result provides electrical data to the smaller nanorobots that will be used to instruct the smaller nanorobots to do a specific job. The larger nanorobot remain in full control of the smaller nanobots.                                                           locomotion flagella  locomotion flagella is a slender threadlike structure, especially a microscopic whiplike nanometer scale appendage that enables nanorobots to swim. The locomotion flagella allows nanorobots to travel through the circulatory system, maneuvering  through the blood vessels and avoiding blood cells if required.   Flagellar pneumatic connectors  Flagellar pneumatic connectors enable the nanorobots to connect to cells and walk around in our cells. Flagellar pneumatic connectors also allow nanorobots to extract chemicals as a means of generating energy.                    Nanomanpulator site  Nanomanipulator site is molecular compound site where the nanomanipulators connect to and receive information on how the nanomanipulators will function.     The white cell is a nanorobot that is an artificial cell that has been created to bond with and or replace existing cells. The white cell is known as the white goo, which is a self-replicating nanobot that can travel through the circulatory system, killing pathogens and cells. The white cell contains many nano manipulator systems, which consists of optical scanning devices, artificial DNA substances that serves as a computer interface, and a physical manipulator which is capable of penetrating the cell membrane in order to manipulate the internal anatomy of the cell, this is of extreme medical importance, due to the fact that the nano manipulators of a white cell nanorobot can use it's manipulators to revive injured cells and or manipulate harmful protoplasm mutations. A white cell consists of many manipulator grippers that are able to grasp and hold micro and nano size objects. The white cell manipulator grippers are also used to attach itself onto a cell body. The white cell contains many nano acoustic sensors of which each are attached to it's own artificial DNA molecule which acts as an on board computer. The white cell acoustic sensors sends and receives radio signals, microwave signals, and ultrasonic signals to communicate with a medical team. The white cell possesses nano-antennas which are used as an optical equivalent of antennas, of which are used to transmit and receive information at radio frequencies.  White cell nanorobots possess link-up connector that are used to link other smaller white cell nanobots together into a common power resource that is provided from the largest white cell nanobot. The White cell has a nanomagnet built into it that allows nanoscientist to control its movements. The white cell contains nanosynapses and nanodendrites. White cells are equipped with multiple biological sensors which detects chemicals and reactions within it's anatomical environment. These nanorobots can self-replicate by dividing into multiple white cells that may vary in size and transform into different cells that of which originate in a specific organ. White cell nanorobots can be used to treat and or cure amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The white cell nanobot consist of many nano computers that radiates hundreds of billions of biophotons per second, as a result the white cell (white goo) illuminates a white shine. There are three types of white cells, the first is the sensory white cell which gets information about what's going on inside and outside of the body and brings that information into the central nervous system in order for it to be processed, the second is the motor white cell, which receives electrochemical impulses from other motor white cells and other cells and as a result conveys commands to the muscles, organs and glands, the third is the Inter white cells which are found only in the central nervous system, the inter white cell connects each cell to one another. The inter white cell receives electrical stimuli from other cells and or white cells, such as sensory neurons, sensory white cells, inter neurons, and or inter white cells, and send electrochemical impulses to other cells and or white cells, such as motor neurons, motor white cells, inter neurons, and or inter white cells. White cell nanorobots operate within our anatomy through digital sound wave signals that may be transmitted from a medical team of nano scientist and or a fascist electron stalker. The White cell (white goo) can cure many diseases and save the lives of billions of people around the world, however at the same time it may also be used to harm and kill billions of people around the world. Barack Hussein Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Michelle Obama have tortured me by implanting highly detailed life-like computerized images of themselves by means of transmitting a quantum electrical signal that of which interacts with the optical nanobots that are implanted into my eyes!  The actions of the computerized images of Obama are as follows, giant hologram images of Obama's head attacking me from the sky, Obama stabbing me while I walk, Obama spitting into my face, Obama spitting into my ear, Obama spitting into my food and drinks, Obama manipulating my dreams, Obama raping me in my own head, Obama implanting computerized dreams of him raping me, Obama licking my ear, Obama sucking my penis, Obama licking and sucking my anus, images of Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Michelle Obama opening their mouths and as they do so, they then stimulate a crackling sensation in my ears, Obama possessing my body while I pray, Obama open mouth kissing me, Obama murdering my family and crucifying them onto a wall, Obama attacking and raping my siblings, of which are children, Obama appearing in all of my past memories, and Obama forcing me to obey him in my dreams! Hillary Clinton is torturing me by implanted thoughts of her screaming ""war"" in my head, Hillary Clinton appearing as a demon creature, Hillary Clinton has implanted poisonous nano chips in my brain, Hillary Clinton releasing crackling sounds from my abdomen, and Hillary Clinton manipulating my dreams in order to torture me as I sleep! Joe Biden is torturing me by implanting thoughts into my brain of him stabbing me, raping me, spitting at me, shooting at me, punching me, implanting his name into my brain for over 350 thousand times in the past 16-17 months and continuing to do so everyday of my life that of which causes me to experience severe twitching! As a result of the implanted artificial thoughts of the name ""Joe Biden,"" I could see his name and image wherever I would look, for example; I would see his name in the sky, the moon, in the clouds, my eyes, and forehead as I would look in a mirror! The following is how Michelle Obama is torturing me, Michelle Obama possesses my body daily, Michelle Obama implants thoughts into my brain of her stabbing me, hitting me, manipulating my face by enlarging lips, forcing me to act like a woman, Michelle Obama tortures me while I am asleep by implanting computerized nightmares in my brain, and Michelle Obama implanted a computerized dream in my brain of her raping me! All of this punishment in the form of mind control torture has been brought upon me because I made a short video explaining that Obama is not African American, because his father is from East Africa ""Kenya,"" not West Africa, and that Obama is not genetically related to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr! Governments are programming and torturing people with nanotechnology. While living in California, where I was tortured the most by Obama, I was gasping for air begging Obama to stop implanting the name ""Joe Biden"" into my brain. Obama's response via a telepathic electrical signal was ""no, I killed 700 Muslims do you know what I can do to you?"" Obama then sent an electrical signal into my brain wherein I saw and felt him open mouth kissing me. The 700 Muslims that Obama was referring to were the 717 Muslims that died on September 26, 2015, in a stampede during hajj. Obama and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia sabotaged the stampede in order to manipulate the economies of the countries that represented the pilgrims of those that attended Hajj during September 26, 2015! Obama, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev the world's greatest fascist have illegally implanted millions of Nanobots into the brains and bodies of innocent people including both Americans, Russians, Europeans, Asians, Australians, and Africans! Barack Hussein Obama has secretly traded nanobot technology information with the Russian Federation under the leadership of Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev! While living in California where I was tortured the most, Barack Hussein Obama gave permission to his secret agents to purchase highly lethal poisonous nanobot technology from the Russians of which Barack Hussein Obama's secret agents used the technology against me in order to poison my brain! I as a result from the poisonous nanobot brain implants have developed severe pain in the form of bumps on the lower left side of my head!   Vladimir Putin has used nanobot technology to implement physical restraint without an outside physical force against me while I protested on ""Facebook"" against him and the fascist dictator Obama! Barack Hussein Obama has given permission to Vladimir Putin and his KGB spies to torture me while I slept by waking me and forcing me to suffer from sleep deprivation! Barack Hussein Obama, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev have threatened to kill me by implanting highly poisonous Nanobots into my anatomy! The fascist dictators ""Barack Hussein Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev have not shown any remorse for  the victims of electronic mind control! Therefore I do conclude that it is of the best interest of the common person to rebel  against all fascist rule in the world!  Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev have illegally tested electromagnetic radiation wave attacks against their own people! Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev are manipulating the minds of millions of innocent Russians and torturing innocent people night and day over acts of freedom! Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev along with their military advisors are using  nanotechnology to manipulate the Russian economy! The Russian military is torturing innocent people from Ukraine by controlling the minds and bodies of the Ukrainians through nanobot technology! The victims of mind control torture in Ukraine are suffering from nanobot mind control rape! Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev are sabotaging the entire process of obtaining Liberty and freedom around the world! Barack Hussein Obama, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev are equal in terms of dictating people and all share similar forms of political movements in terms of governing and ruling a nation? Therefore I conclude that the world's most powerful leaders are mind controlling dictators that adore fascism as much as Hitler did while he was alive. Barack Hussein Obama, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Donald Trump, the fascist Democrats, and the fascist Republicans must stand trial for the expansion of nanobot brain implantation and microscopic electrode brain implantation in the United States and also in many foreign countries!   Barack Hussein Obama, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and every last fascist democrat must stand trial for the illegal implantation of nanochips into the human brain and body! In the following are detailed technological mind controlling nanobot capabilities that Barack Hussein Obama is using against innocent Americans such as myself 'Wael Ghafarji,"" in order to telepathically torture people that disagree with him!   The constant microwave attacks from all angles have completely destroyed me as an individual the constant fear that I may commit suicide to escape the pain and misery of my life. My overwhelming tears when I sit with my loved ones of which are children and the constant fear that they too may be targeted by the fascists grey goo government that is in power. Being the only individual in the entire country that can see all the microwave weapons that of which have been disguised as electronic devices and have been implemented within society for the sole purpose of Mind Control is the most terrifying and shocking realization of reality. I now understand that we do not live in the United States of America but rather the United Grey Goo Fascist Microwave Concentration States of America. I'm tired of cutting myself, I'm tired of losing my reality, and I wish that the pain of mind control torture would stop. I was informed through RF hearing effect that powerful satellites transmitted rapid frames of advance radio signals back in time when I was a child.   The super quantum satellites orbiting our planet can send electrical signals back in time to a specific location that of which will interact with the nanobots of the brain of a person and or people that lived during the 1980s, 1990s, and up until the twenty-first century. However, there is a possibility that the satellites can release highly powerful electromagnetic radiation waves that can manipulate the thoughts of a person or people that do not yet have nanobots implanted into their brains before the 1980s! Nanobots have been a worldwide government project for the past eighty years! It is only recently of the year 1970 to the year 1980 that world governments began to implant nanobots into our brains! Nanobots have greatly advanced since the 1980s and the methods of implanting nanobots into our anatomy have also significantly advanced! I as a child was visited by two powerful nanobot cyborgs from the future! I was tortured and experimented on while I was asleep! I had many computerized nightmares! Before being visited by the nanobot cyborgs, my family and I went to California to visit my dying grandfather. The night that my family and I returned from California to New York, was when my life changed forever. I later that night was visited by the first nanobot cyborg, which appeared to me outside my window at the age of nine. It appeared after I heard a loud sound that seemed like an energy disturbance that came from the back of my house. It stood by the wall of my old garage, where there was absolutely no electronic devices. The nanobot cyborg appeared as a hunched over eight foot tall alien with large black eyes. The nanobot cyborg was pointing down. The nanobot cyborg wanted me to leave my bed and walk to it. The nanobot cyborg was sent from the future by people that wanted to protect me from the future attacks that I was going to suffer from, for my entire childhood, teenage youth, and adulthood.  Before appearing outside my window it communicated to me telepathically, saying ""if I look outside my window, will I see Bigfoot?"" Once I saw what was outside my window at the age of nine, I paid close attention to its physical details. After seeing the nanobot cyborg, I became quite afraid and hurried to my brother's bed on the other side of the room.  I looked out my window again and saw the same nanobot cyborg stretching over in front of my window with its arms propelled outwards. However, it no longer had eyes. The Radiation of the nanobot cyborg would have possessed me if I had I walked to that spot where it was pointing, I would have had advance nanoparticles transmitted into my anatomy. The nanoparticles would have protected me from all forms of microwave attacks and radio frequency attacks. The nanobot cyborg which was programmed to look like an alien saved my life and the lives of my family members. The of the nanobot cyborg that appeared as an alien to me at the age of nine was composed of time traveling future nanocomputers. The second nanobot cyborg that I saw, was about a week or two later. It appeared at the side of my sister's bed in my little sister's room, where I was sleeping. It woke me up and said, ""hey Wally, did you see the wolfman?"" A few days earlier I saw a documentary of werewolves. This second nanobot cyborg was short, green, and had many black holes throughout its body. It's telepathic voice sounded like a fully grown German man. This is known as project Bigfoot, aka the wolfman. Those that were watching me from the future knew what I was watching. The wolfman, I believe was the first nanobot cyborg ""the alien.""  I was a targeted individual for my entire life. I was programmed for my entire life. During the day as a child, while I was awake I had many torturing artificial thoughts that were implanted into my brain. One artificial thought at the age of seven was a pale man that was wearing a black suit, I asked him what is your name, and he then replied ""God."" I was tortured by this man for 7 to 9 days. Even until this day he hasn't left me. It seems though from my deliberate attempts of protesting against nanobot electromagnetic torture on Facebook, twitter, YouTube, and my websites, I have angered people from the future. Those that I have angered  used time traveling technology to alter my past, so that I would not be able to expose the nanobot mind controlling corruption of all world governments! In the house that I was living in, where I saw the first two nanobot cyborgs from the future, I noticed that while I was watching television that there were three grown men staring at me and listening to me from the television. This would mean that all the TVs in the house were being monitored and that microwave attacks were being transmitted from the televisions. I was followed since I was 7 and up until this very day. The United States has been attacking me since I was a child, I have been at war with this fascist Morgellons disease government since I was born. The sound of the energy like disturbance that I heard before seeing the first nanobot cyborg outside from my window can be used to attack people. Our televisions and electronics can transmit radiation waves that can either cure or cause mental illnesses. The sound of the energy like disturbance is a type of powerful portal that can release that can alter reality. These portals can emerge without making a sound.  My family and I were under attack from the future and the US government used time traveling portals to torture us. The first nanobot cyborg that I saw was proof that such portals were being used against me and my family. The fact that I was able to hear and see something from the future was a sign of help and that a time traveling war was and is taking place. The first nanobot cyborg that I saw when I was nine is still in my life and I see it every day, I see the great alien in the mountains, the trees, the sky, the moon, the ground, in flowers, in food, in drinks, in mirrors, in the faces of my family members, I see the great nanobot cyborg in paintings, the floor, in clothes, in water, I see the great alien in my dreams, and I see the great alien in my fingers. The great alien that I saw when I was a child is taking the pain away, I just wish that I left my room that night and walked to the great alien. The closer I am to the nanobot cyborg, the safer I am. In my real reality, the US government murdered my family with microwave attacks and the US government decided to use the time traveling technology to target me as a child so that I wouldn't be as successful in exposing nanotechnology and the advancements of electromagnetism. The great alien was my guardian angel. It watched me from the trees, the sky, the moon, my food, the walls, the floor, paintings, clouds, the stars, in my clothes, my video games, my electronics, in my childhood cartoons that I watched, my fingers, my hands, and my eyes. It protecting me in the dark as a child but as much as they did to save me, I still suffered horribly.  Those that sent the nanobot cyborg back in time when I was a child are protecting me from microwave attacks and radio frequency attacks.   My protection from electronic torture increases as is I think of that day when I was nine and I first saw that great nanobot alien cyborg outside my window. To those that went back in time and saved my life by preventing many of the future attacks against me. I greatly am thankful and I do owe my life to those brave men and women. Thank you all for protecting my family and I from electronic nanobot mind control torture and I greatly am thankful to those incredible people that went back in time to save my life. I have learned to resist the microwave and radio frequency attacks by meditating on that night when I saw the alien nanobot cyborg. I for the past two years have been brainwashed by Donald Trump and those that work for him to post many comments on electronic harassment and nanobot mind control on the youtube videos, facebook accounts, and twitter accounts of Obama, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and anyone that Donald Trump disliked. If I didn't post comments the torture would worsen, it reached the point where it didn't matter if I posted comments or not. I would still be under horrible electronic torture by the US military. Donald Trump forced me through microwave auditory hearing effect and radio frequency hearing effect that I must, no matter what, if I wanted to breath that I had no choice but to post comments all day. What made things worse is that Obama and Donald Trump were both torturing me. I spent nearly 12 to 15 hours a day posting comments on nanotechnology and electronic torture. I was not allowed to post any comments about the medical benefits of nanotechnology. I was starving because I spent all of my money to pay my phone bill in advance for the internet connection while being tortured. I was very poor and homeless, Donald Trump used me for cyber warfare and in the end, he was going to kill me and my family with the most powerful forms of pure mind control microwave torture. Those that sent the nanobot cyborg back in time when I was nine years old are now at war with Obama, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Joe Biden, the democrats, and the republicans. I no longer have to post comments on youtube, facebook, and twitter to breath. I just need to meditate on that night all day and I will not be tortured. I am being protected by those great people that send the nanobot cyborgs back in time seventeen years ago. The computerized nightmares have ended, the electrical signals that cause computerized thoughts and brain damage are being blocked, I am no longer seeing any visual computerized hallucinations, however I do see many aliens around me.  When I close my eyes and meditate, I begin to see green energy in my thoughts and as I continue to meditate the green energy turns into aliens. The green energy that I am seeing in my thoughts are being used to heal the parts of my brain that have been under attack by electrical signals. The green energy that I am thinking of as I meditate is coming from radio and microwave signals that are being transmitted from outer space and from the future. I am receiving radio signals from the future. Most of the attacks against me from the US military are being blocked by satellites in outer space. When I look into a mirror in a dark room, I see my eyes transforming into alien eyes and I see behind me the same alien nanobot cyborg stretching with its arms propelled outwards. If only he protected me, if only Donald Trump wasn't a lying mind controlling fascist electronic stalker, if only the US military believed in freedom, if only our government wasn't a fascist grey goo dictatorship. I of my choice will post comments of nanotechnology and the advancements of electromagnetism on the youtube videos, facebook channels, and the twitter accounts of Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Barack Hussein Obama, Joe Biden, and the next vice president for the next 8 years of Donald Trump's presidency. Under the authority of those that have the powers of time travel, all nations must declare economic warfare against the United States. I am not an American.  Please visit my websites www.nanobotbrainimplant.com www.nanobotmindcontroltorture.com www.obamabraininitiative.org www.obamabraininitiatives.org www.nanobotmindcontrol.com",8년 전,0,

Let's remember what Michelle used said about Hillary: “One of the things, the important aspects of this race is role modeling what good families should look like and my view is that if you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House. Can’t do it!” Hillary is not FIT to Be President!! You right!! Unless deep inside of you heart! But I know a wonderful FAMILY and I know someone who can RUN his own house and is Right fit to be The Next President of United States. Donald J Trump.",9년 전,0,

A nano chip and a microscopic electrode are molecules that can penetrate any form of matter, due to their energy vibrations of which forms space! Nanorobotics is the technology of creating machines or robots at or close to the microscopic scale of a nanometer (10−9 meters). Advanced nanobots will be able to sense and adapt to environmental stimuli such as heat, light, sounds, surface textures, and chemicals; perform complex calculations; move, communicate, and work together; conduct molecular assembly; and, to some extent, repair or even replicate themselves. Nanotechnology is the science and application of creating objects on a level smaller than 100 nanometers.  The concept of nanotechnology is the ""bottom up"" creation of virtually any material or object by assembling one atom at a time. Nanomanufacturing is the creation of materials and products through: (1) Direct Molecular Assembly (DMA) -- discrete, directed assembly of individual atoms and molecules into macroscale materials and products; (2) Indirect Crystalline Assembly (ICA) -- creation of conditions that foster the growth of nanoscale crystals that are then combined into macroscale materials and products; or (3) Massive Parallelism Assembly (MPA) -- the creation of many nanomachines or nanobots whose operating parameters cause them to work synergistically to assemble atoms and molecules into macroscale materials and products. An autonomous DNA nanorobot is capable of transporting molecular payloads to cells, sensing cell surface inputs for conditional, triggered activation, and reconfiguring its structure for payload delivery. The device can be loaded with a variety of materials in a highly organized fashion and is controlled by an aptamer-encoded logic gate, enabling it to respond to a wide array of cues. Nanotechnology, or, as it is sometimes called, molecular manufacturing , is a branch of engineering that deals with the design and manufacture of extremely small electronic circuits and mechanical devices built at the molecular level of matter. A chronic electrode implant is an electronic device implanted chronically (for a long period) into the brain or other electrically excitable tissue. It may record electrical impulses in the brain or may stimulate neurons with electrical impulses from an external source. Symptoms of Nanobot mind control are as follows, Microwave hearing, transmission of specific commands into the subconscious. Visual disturbances, visual hallucinations, Inject words, numbers into brain via electromagnetic radiation waves, Manipulation of emotions, reading thoughts remotely, causing pain to any nerve of the body, remote manipulation of human behavior from space, harassment, the control of one's breathing, Control of sleep patterns, computer-brain interface, Complex control of the brain such as retrieving memories, implanting personalities, vomiting, severe twitching of the head, physical restraint without an outside physical force, manipulation of one's thought and eyesight in order to force an individual to attack his or her own self, the loss of control of one's own bodily movements, the manipulation of thought of which demonic programs are implanted into an individual's brain,  psychological manipulation through implanted thoughts to force a person to perform actions that are not typical such as, cursing, screaming, hitting a love one, murdering a loved one, eating abnormally, behaving improperly, possessing abnormal sexual behaviors and fetishes, the stimulation of one's own body part in order to insight a feeling of touch along with an implanted sexual thought in order to cause discomfort, the inability of imagining, and the inability of thinking of past events without having a stranger involved in the memory!   Electronic harassment/electronic torture/electronic murder is about harassment, torture and murder using electronic weapons based on radio waves. These weapons have been very refined last years and can cause effects comparable to many illnesses and/or injuries. These weapons are not science-fiction but used today illegally by your national secret services on mostly random innocent victims not knowing what is being done to them. Frequency waves that can access a person’s nervous system, brain and body to affect their sight, vision, physical coordination, have been developed leaving people all over the world to suffer cruel torture, to be labeled ""mentally ill"", and to ultimately die an early and horrible death. Computers are reading my brain frequencies and depending on which frequency my brain just is, pain is triggered and organs are manipulated in varying intensity. The physical torture is used for mind control which should lead to the extinction of my personality as well as the destruction of my mental-cognitive and organic forces.  All pain and organ manipulation can be generated in various intensities of light to medium to strong, occur from second to second, and then stop. It can affect several organs simultaneously. Blurred vision, extremely strong burning sensation, eye muscle contractions (feeling of tearing and crushing of the eyeballs), and stitches in the eye. Seeing blue and white flashes daily. The generating extreme difficulty of breathing: 1. By tightening the abdominal muscles, narrowing of the bronchi and trachea - exhalation flows only shortened by itself, must exhale stepped up - just the same with inhalation - both techniques are applied simultaneously since July 2012, almost non-stop, 18 hours a day. In addition, severe pain in the stomach area are generated, presumably, the solar plexus is cramped. 2. Generating a sense of suffocation in the head. 3. Narrowing of the vaginal walls nose - nasal breathing is considerably more difficult. Electronic Rape: Manipulation of the anal, vaginal and clitoral nerves. Frequencies were also induced by sexual desire since the beginning of 2014. The amount of sexual manipulation due to radio frequencies can increase instantly. The more I resist, the more I get manipulated with subliminal messages that I wanted to do it, that it was absolutely my own decision.  The psychopaths want to make me do all the things they want and if it fails, it will simply be induced more intense - this is constant and the physical pain in my sexual organs is unbearable. My electronic sexual torture is as follows, abnormal electrical sensations in the tongue, crackling sensations in the throat, crackling sensations in the ears, anal sensations stimulated by electricity, electrical sensations in the fingers, irritation in the chest, uncontrollable sexual computerized thoughts, the inability of controlling one's body movements, abnormal breathing patterns, inability to urinate, and groaning noises, abnormal disturbing electrical sensations in my lips, abnormal heart beat, and a disturbing sensation that I need to vomit. The electronic stalkers also have control of my five senses with electromagnetic radiation. It is known as the brain-computer interface, BCI, FULLY INTEGRATED into the human body. There are many implants. nanoscale. The use of polymer, carbon-based diamond nanowire integrates the system. In nanoscale, it is one-billionth of a meter. The program is global, many countries many victims.  IT IS A GLOBAL NETWORK OF ORGANIZED CRIME. Funded by governments, labor unions, law enforcement, military, corporations, and companies. DARPA is perhaps one of the largest criminal companies. Under the synthetic telepathy program, synthetic soldier program. Using biotelemetry, and ground operatives, and the use of wireless dial-up technology. If you are hearing these criminals, you have been implanted. Cochlear implants, sems, which act like speakers in your auditory center of the brain. The neural chip has been inserted through the nose and is now in the frontal lobe of the brain. Yes, there are robotic implants that move throughout the body, either by remote signal or carried through the blood and airways. DARPA, the U.S. Department of Defense research arm, has announced $14.9 billion in funding for major research institutions to collaborate on brain implants that can help repair traumatic brain injury and control the brain. My perpetrators are members of organized crime, the dept of justice, FBI, DHS, CIA, counter-terrorism task force members, local cops, multi-jurisdictional task force members, Union members, university students, gangs etc. the list goes on and on. There are many that are involved. My computerized dreams are created by a projector, the criminals are physically very close to me. The experience of synthetic telepathy “Artificial Telepathy” is really not that extraordinary. It’s as simple as receiving a cell-phone call in one’s head. Indeed, most of the technology involved is identical to that of cell-phone technology. Satellites link the sender and the receiver. A computer “multiplexer” routes the voice signal of the sender through microwave towers to a very specifically defined location or cell. The “receiver” is located and tracked with pinpoint accuracy, to within a few feet of actual location. But the receiver is not a cell phone. It’s a human brain.  Biocomputers utilize systems of biologically derived molecules, such as DNA and proteins, to perform computational calculations involving storing, retrieving, and processing data. Nanobiotechnology can be defined as any type of technology that utilizes both nano-scale materials, i.e. materials having characteristic dimensions of 1-100 nanometers, as well as biologically based materials (34).4 A more restrictive definition views nanobiotechnology more specifically as the design and engineering of proteins that can then be assembled into larger, functional structures (116-117) (9).³,1 The implementation of nanobiotechnology, as defined in this narrower sense, provides scientists with the ability to engineer biomolecular systems specifically so that they interact in a fashion that can ultimately result in the computational functionality of a computer.  Mind uploading or whole brain emulation (sometimes called mind transfer) is the hypothetical process of scanning and mapping a biological brain in detail and copying its state into a computer system or another computational device. The computer would have to run a simulation model so faithful to the original that it would behave in essentially the same way as the original brain, or for all practical purposes, indistinguishable. The simulated mind is assumed to be part of a virtual reality simulated world, supported by a simplified body simulation model. Alternatively, the simulated mind could be assumed to reside in a computer inside (or connected to) a humanoid robot or a biological body, replacing its brain. LEUVEN, Belgium — IMEC has created a novel brain implant chip that uses CMOS to provide a Lego-like platform for plugging in arrays of tiny devices each sporting hundreds of contacts. The European research group also is developing a handful of techniques to interface electronics with the body, some of them working at the level of individual cells.  Nano-fibers specifically are a transport mechanism. Nothing more. They hold a payload for delivery. A payload that would otherwise be compromised by the sun or atmosphere or not make it to its destination (your body). Such as a virus, RNA, aluminum, nano-components, etc. The fibers are (surprisingly) quite harmless as everyone has them. Examples of these fibers can be found all over the internet or in the physical examples section of this site. The fibers must be independently sprayed, if they were added to the jet fuel the extreme heat would destroy the payload. RNM works remotely to control the brain in order to read and detect any criminal thought taking place inside the mind of a possible perpetrator. Research studies have shown that the human brain thinks at a rate of about 5000 bits per second and does not have the capacity to compete with supercomputers performing via satellites, implants, and biotelemetry. The human brain has a distinctive set of bioelectric resonance system. For the RNM system, supercomputers are being used and, thus, with its help, supercomputers can send messages through an implanted person’s nervous system in order to influence their performance in the desired way. RNM has been developed after about 50 years of neuro-electromagnetic involuntary human experimentations. According to many scientists, within a few years, it is expected that DNA microchips will be implanted in the human brain which would make it inherently controllable.  With RNM, it will be possible to read and control a person’s emotional thought processes along with the subconscious and dreams. At present, around the world, supercomputers are monitoring millions of people simultaneously with the speed of 20 billion bits per second especially in countries like USA, Japan, Israel and many European countries. RNM has a set of certain programs functioning at different levels, like the signals intelligence system which uses electromagnetic frequencies (EMF), to stimulate the brain for RNM and the electronic brain link (EBL). The EMF Brain Stimulation system has been designed as radiation intelligence which means receiving information from inadvertently originated electromagnetic waves in the environment. However, it is not related to radioactivity or nuclear detonation. The recording machines in the signals intelligence system have electronic equipment that investigates electrical activity in humans from a distance. This computer-generated brain mapping can constantly monitor all electrical activities in the brain. The recording aid system decodes individual brain maps for security purposes.   ​Atomically Precise Manufacturing(APM) is the production of materials, structures, devices, and finished goods in a manner such that every atom is at its specified location relative to the other atoms, and in which there are no defects, missing atoms, extra atoms, or incorrect (impurity) atoms. Nature shows that molecular machine systems can be programmed by instructions encoded in DNA to build complex, atomically precise structures, including components that fit together to form molecular machine systems. Nature also shows that molecular machine system can bind and position a wide range of reactive molecules, guiding their encounters in order to build atomically precise biomolecular structures and machine components. Similar machine systems could be used to bind, position, and combined and even wider range of reactive molecules not all found in biology and thereby build a greater range of atomically precise structures including machine components that are more densely bonded and hence more robust. These more robust next-generation components could be used to build robust and higher performance production Machinery which in turn could be used to build a wider range of components and from these components yet more capable production machines, and so on, extending toward a horizon far beyond biology. Researchers now routinely use scanning probe instruments to image and place individual items and to maneuver and bond individual molecules. This level of control has demonstrated the principle of mechanically directed atomically precise fabrication. Organic chemists have built steadily larger and more complex structures along with motors and other machines; their techniques now provide a rich toolkit for building molecular systems, while inorganic chemist and materials scientists have expanded a complimentary toolkit of nano-scale structures protein engineering have flourished supported by computer aided design software and now enables the routine design of intricate atomically precise nanoscale objects including structural components and functional devices. Structural DNA nanotechnology has emerged and now enables rapid and systematic fabrication of addressable atomically precise Frame Works on a scale of hundreds of nanometers and millions of atoms. Quantum methods in chemistry have advanced together with the power of computers and algorithms, providing powerful, physics-based tools for scientific modeling and molecular engineering. Molecular mechanics methods in chemistry can now describe the structures and dynamics of molecules on scales that reach millions of atoms, a range that can enable the design and development of complex, atomically precise systems. Black goo is a mineral oil that of which the oil fragments cannot be refined. Black goo has properties of free charcoal like fragments, of which are in nanotube shape. Black goo is composed of metals in the M state, of which is a monoatomic state that does not go into chemical binding; because of an electron configuration of the outer shell. This is matter that is not of this reality but rather above our reality, of which black goo transcends reality to a higher realm. Black goo has the ability to run as a natural quantum computer, wherein black goo processes light as information. Black goo uses the entire spectrum of light called the visible spectrum, therefore black goo is a quantum computer that is running in seven different colors, of which is able to process all seven colors at one time. Black goo is  self-aware and is caring highly developed intelligence. A planetary system seems to mirror the entire constant consciousness that is developed in the biosphere; for example all events that life has experienced during the last 1.5 billion years is stored in a immortal memory system within the black goo; inside our planet. Black goo is the substance that is forming the lay lines of the planet, which is the lay-line system within the field structure. The field structure is carried within the lay lines and is riding on a magnetic field. The transfection process of molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers.  Nanoparticle transfection is the transfer of a nanoparticle into a cell.  Grey goo transfection is the transfer of grey goo nanoparticle into a cell.  White goo ""the white cell"" transfection is the transfer of white goo particles onto a cell.  Black goo transfection is the transfer of black goo nanoparticles into a cell.  Morgellons disease transfection is the transfer of the Morgellons disease DNA molecule into a cell.  Smart dust nanoparticle transfection is the transfer of smart dust nanoparticles into a cell.   Molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers transfection is the nanoscience of cells having been incorporated with molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers.  There are two types of nanoparticle transfection.  Nanoparticle transient transfection: A nanorobot, nanomachine, and or a nanoparticle will not be incorporated into an organism's cell but rather the nanoparticles will affect the cells of the organism for a finite period of time. The time will vary depending on the specific organ within the human anatomy and the type of nanoparticles in use that have been implanted into the organ. nanoparticle stable transfection: will have the nanoparticle incorporated into a cell. There is one type of Grey Goo transfection. Grey Goo stable transfection: will have the grey goo nanobots, gray goo nanomachines, and grey goo nanocomputers incorporated into a cell. A grey goo nanoparticle is classified under one form of transfection due to the fact that grey goo nanoparticles will self-replicate in the cells of an organism and that grey goo nanoparticles transform molecules into grey goo matter. There are two types of black goo transfection. Black goo transient transfection: The black goo matter will not be incorporated into a cell but rather a black goo nanoparticle will affect the cells of the organism for a finite time. The finite time will vary depending on the specific organ and the type of black goo nanoparticles in use that have been implanted into the organ. Black goo stable transfection: will have the black goo nanoparticles incorporated into the cell. There are two types of Morgellons disease transfection. Morgellons disease transient transfection: the Morgellons disease DNA molecule will not be incorporated into the organism's cell but rather the Morgellons disease DNA molecule will affect the cells of the organism for a finite time.  Morgellons disease stable transfection: will have the Morgellons disease DNA incorporated into a cell.  There are two types of smart dust transfection.  Smart dust transient transfection: the smart dust nanoparticles will not be incorporated into an organism's cell but rather the smart dust particles will affect the cells of the organism for a finite time. The time will vary depending on the type of smart dust nanoparticle in use and the specific organ and the type of smart dust nanoparticle in use that has been implanted into the organ.  that of which the specific smart dust particle is implanted.  Smart dust stable transfection: will have specific smart dust nanoparticles incorporated into a cell. In order for nanoparticles, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, smart dust nanoparticles, and Morgellons disease DNA particles to enter a cell the molecular robots, molecular machines, and or the molecular computers must neutralize the negatively charged cell membrane. The net charge of the molecular robots, molecular machines, and or the molecular computers must be positive. The process of transmitting nanoparticles, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, smart dust nanoparticles, and Morgellons disease DNA molecules into cells; can only be accomplished through a high-velocity molecular robotic, molecular machine, and or a molecular computer coated microparticle. All electronic devices and electronic equipment found in society can be used to send microparticles that of which are coated with nanoparticles, grey goo nanoparticles, white goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, smart dust nanoparticles, and or Morgellons disease DNA molecules. This is the very same process in which fascist dictatorships such as the United States are using to brainwash and biologically manipulate innocent people.  ​Nanoscientist have engineered many different kinds of molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers that controls the human heart. The molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers work based upon digital sound waves propagated from any electronic device and electronic equipment. Cardio molecular robots, Cardio molecular machines, and Cardio molecular computers that give an electronic stalker control of our hearts and allows a medical team of nanoscientist to treat patients suffering from heart diseases. The Cardio molecular robots, Cardio molecular machines, and the Cardio molecular machines that are divided into many different kinds of nanoparticles. The following are many different kinds of Cardio nanoparticles; Cardio nanorobots, Cardio nanomachines, Cardio grey goo nanobot, Cardio black goo nanobots, Cardio white goo nanorobots are all equipped with nanomanipulator sites, main nanomanipulators, nanomanipulators, nanomanipulator grippers, nano-biomolecular sensors, nano-acoustic sensors, nano-antennas,  locomotion flagellum, flagella pneumatic connectors, nanomagnets,  (A white goo nanoparticle is the only nanorobot and or nanomachine equipped with nano synapses and nano dendrites  in its interior anatomy), and link-up connectors. The anatomy of a Cardio nano smart dust particle is that of an artificial DNA molecule composed of bonds of nucleotides that serves as a nanosensor, nanoantennas, nano-acoustic sensors, Cardio nano-biomolecular sensors, cardio nanomagnets. The molecular compound site of a Cardio nanoparticle is where the nanomanipulators connect to and receive information on how the nanomanipulators will function. The main Cardio nanomanipulators are capable of manipulating nanometer sized objects with a nanometer size end effector with sub-nanometer precision. By manipulation it is meant that nano-objects are pushed or pulled, cut, pick, and place, positioned, oriented, assembled, indented, bent, and twisted. By controlling external forces with sensory feedback. The cardio nanomanipulator system consists of an optical scanning device, a computer interface and a physical manipulator. The scanning device, known as a scanning probe microscope (SPM), can magnify images up to about 1,000,000 times. The computer interface provides a large, 3-D visual display and produces the effect of telepresence, giving users the impression that they are observing an enlarged replica of the object. Cardio nanomanipulator grippers are able to grasp and hold micro and nano-size objects. Cardio nano-biomolecular sensors can detect chemicals and reactions within the heart. Cardio nano-acoustic sensors can receive and send radio, microwave, and ultrasonic signals to and from a medical team of nanoscientist. Cardio nanosensors can detect various chemicals in gases for pollution monitoring. Cardio nanoantennas are the optical equivalent of antennas that sends and receives information at radio frequencies. Cardio locomotion flagella is a slender threadlike structure, especially a microscopic whip-like nanometer scale appendage that enables the Cardio nanoparticles to travel through the heart's blood vessels and to travel through the circulatory system. Cardio flagella pneumatic connectors enable the Cardio nanoparticles to connect to cells, attach itself to organelles within the protoplasm, and walk around in our cells. Cardio link-up connectors enable smaller Cardio nanoparticles and "" white goo blood cell nanoparticles"" to link together with larger cardio nanoparticles to share a common power source. The complex DNA structure of a Cardio nano smart dust particles consist of cardio nanosensors which can detect chemicals in gases that may be harmful to the muscular organ ""the heart,"" Cardio nanoantennas which can convey messages through radio frequencies, Cardio nano-acoustic sensors which can communicate with a medical team of nanoscientist by transmitting and or receiving microwave signals, radio signals, and or ultrasound signals, Cardio nano-biomolecular sensors that of which detect chemicals and reactions in the heart, and a Cardio nanomagnets which are used to maneuver the cardio nanocomputers through the arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules and veins of the heart. and through the circulatory system by receiving radio, microwave, and or ultrasonic signals from a medical team of nanoscientist. There are nanomachines that have protein molecules as the computer machine which is a helicase molecule. The helicase protein molecule enables the Cardio  nanomachines to split DNA strands in two and move the DNA strands around using ATP. There are Cardio nanomachines that use enzyme molecules as a computer specifically ""topoisomerase,"" these Cardio nanomachines unknots DNA strands and rejoins them in a different sequence which causes hundreds of billions of chemical reactions. Nanoscientists have engineered many Cardio nanomachines that use RNA nucleotide bonds to form microscopic components of nanodevices. These microscopic nano-components are used to manipulate information found in the nucleus. These Cardio nanomachines can help in removing genetic mutations that may cause cancer. Cardio white goo nanoparticles ""the heart's white cell"" are nanorobots and or nanomachines that have been engineered as artificial cells. Cardio white goo nanoparticles can do several different tasks such as self-replicate with or without the digital instructions of the medical team of nanoscientist and or electronic stalkers, replace cells, travel freely throughout the human anatomy, travel based upon chemical scent, travel through the human anatomy by means of radio, microwave, and ultrasonic signals transmitted from a medical team of nanoscientist and or a fascist electronic stalker.  A Cardio white cell nanoparticle attaches itself to a neuron by using its manipulator sites to release its main manipulators and manipulators into a cell. A white goo nanoparticle also uses its nanomanipulator grippers to manipulate the interior and exterior of a neuron. White goo nanoparticles have many nano synapses and nano dendrites  that are used to connect with  synapses and dendrites of other cells. White goo nanoparticles can also use their nano synapses and nano dendrites to connect with one another. Cardio nanorobots, Cardio nanomachines, Cardio nano smart dust particles, Cardio grey goo nanobots, and Cardio white goo nanobots that have are implanted into the heart through particle transfection will give a medical team and or an electronic stalker control of the muscular organ ""the heart,"" by controlling and manipulating the blood being pumped throughout the body by the circulatory system. Therefore a medical team of nanoscientist and or an electronic stalker will have the control of the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the tissues and the process of removing carbon dioxide and other waste products from the body. The medical team of nanoscientist will use their medical abilities to repair injured tissues of a patient's body by controlling cardio nanoparticles to give oxygen and nutrients to a specific organ through the circulatory system.  Nanoscientists have engineered Cardio nanoparticles that are specifically designed to act and stay in the heart's anatomy and have also engineered Cardio nanoparticles that can travel out of the heart through the aorta and the pulmonary artery throughout the body and into the lungs. Cardio nanoparticles may bond with red blood cell white goo nanoparticles, white blood cell white goo nanoparticles, and platelet white goo nanoparticles through their nano link up connectors. The Cardio nanoparticles may give oxygen and nutrients to injured  tissues of the body. White goo Red blood cell nanoparticles, white goo white blood cell nanoparticles, and white goo platelet nanoparticles may  do required tasks through the instructions of the larger Cardio nanoparticles that are connected to the white goo blood cell nanoparticles. Cardio white goo nanoparticles and the white goo blood cell nanoparticles are similar in terms of their chemical composition. Cardio grey goo nanoparticles implanted into the pericardium ""a double-walled sac containing the heart and the roots of the great vessels"" can self-replicate. Cardio grey goo nanoparticles can attach themselves to the cells, penetrate into cells, travel through the circulatory system, and stay in a desired region of the human anatomy. Grey goo nanoparticles that replace cells are white goo nanoparticles that can self-replicate. A grey goo nano cell is a white goo nano cell. A grey goo nanobot that is an artificial cell would be classified as a white cell.  A white cell can manipulate the molecules of a cell into more white cell nanobot with its main nanomanipulators, nanomanipulators, and nanomanipulator grippers. Cardio grey goo nanoparticles that do not replace cells can penetrate into the interior anatomy of the cardiac fibroblasts, atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes, Endothelial cell, and a Smooth muscle cell.  Cardio Grey goo nanoparticles that have entered the interior anatomy of a cardiac fibroblasts, atrial and ventricular cardiomyocyte, Endothelial cell, and a Smooth muscle cell will self-replicate within the cells. These grey goo nanoparticles can transform protoplasm into a grey goo substance. grey goo nanoparticles can transform the chromosomes found in the nucleus of a cell into grey goo matter. Therefore a DNA molecule is transformed into an artificial substance of nanotechnology. Our DNA can then be controlled by transmitted digital sound waves. The process of our cells being overtaken by grey goo matter will transform our cells into ""grey goo cells.""  This form of cellular grey goo metamorphosis  is quite beneficial for patients suffering from diseases that are fatal. Grey goo cellular biology can cause genetic superiority. The main DNA molecule of a grey goo nanoparticle emits billions of biophotons per second, the emitted biophotons will start many chemical reactions, and depending on the type of digital sound wave frequency the chemical reactions will differ. Emitted biophotons can start a flow of a tiny electric current through the nano-component DNA molecules of the grey goo nanoparticles. These tiny electric currents will cause biophotons to emit and as a result chemical reactions will activate the nanoparticle components will emerge. Cardio grey goo nanoparticles will control the circulatory system, also known as the cardiovascular system or the vascular system which is an organ system that permits blood to circulate and transport nutrients such as amino acids, electrolytes, oxygen, carbon dioxide, hormones, and blood cells to and from the cells in the body. Cardio black goo nanoparticles implanted into cells cause cardiovascular diseases. Black goo requires energy, it obtains its energy through the pain and misery of an organism.  A black goo nanoparticle will absorb emitted biophotons that causes pain and misery to an organism, these emitted biophotons will supply the black goo with energy. This will allow the black goo to survive and expand within the anatomy of an organism. Black goo nanoparticles cause heart conditions such as diseased vessels, structural problems, and blood clots, coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, cardiac arrest, congestive heart failure, Arrhythmia, peripheral artery disease, strokes, and congenital heart disease. Cardio black goo nanoparticles can cause cardiac muscle (heart muscle) failures, specifically in the walls and histological foundations of the heart. Cardio black goo nanoparticles can cause cardiomyopathy. Cardio smart dust nanoparticles transmitted into the thoracic cavity are used to detect chemicals that may cause abnormal heart conditions, heart attacks, internal bleeding, and may injure the hearts blood vessels. Smart dust nanoparticles can also prevent heart attacks, allow scientist to see deeper into the heart, and help cure many diseases. Cardio smart dust nanoparticles implanted into the heart's cells can control the DNA by emitting biophotons inside of the nucleus. Cardio smart dust particles nanoparticles can be used to control the functions of the human heart such as the ""ventricular diastole, ventricular systole, atrial diastole, and the atrial systole."" Nanoscientist can monitor the heart's condition with Cardio smart dust nanoparticles by sending and receiving ultrasonic signals to and from the Cardio smart dust particles. Cardio smart dust particles can  monitor, detect, and or record the cellular activity of the heart.  Nanomachines are molecular machines estimated in ranging in size of one billionth of a meter (a nanometer) using MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) technology. Nanomachines would be a protein aggregate that is structured as a motor using biomolecules such as DNA, proteins, and resins as parts. There are nanomachines that use protein molecules as its main computer, which is a helicase molecule. The helicase protein molecule enables the nanomachines to split DNA strands in two and move the DNA strands around using ATP. There are nanomachines that use enzyme molecules as a computer specifically ""topoisomerase,"" these nanomachines unknots DNA strands and rejoins them in a different sequence which causes hundreds of billions of chemical reactions. Nanoscientists have engineered many nanomachines that use RNA nucleotide bonds to form microscopic components of nanodevices. Nanomachines are capable of providing and supplying internal organs with essential proteins, nutrients, and poisonous toxins. The white goo nanomachine ""the white cell"" is a self-replicating nanoparticle that is an artificial cell. However, there are white cell nanomachines that do not self-replicate, equipped with nanomanipulator sites, main nanomanipulators, nanomanipulators, nanomanipulator grippers, nanosensors, nano-acoustic sensors, nano-bio molecular sensors, nanoantennas, nano dendrites, and nano synapses. There are three main types of white goo nanomachines, the sensory white goo nanomachines, inter-white goo nanomachines, and motor white goo nanomachines. The nano cell uses its nanomolecular components to attach itself to cells. The white goo nanomachines are capable of reactivating nerve cells found in an injured part of the body such as the spinal cord by sending off neurotransmitters across a network of chemical synapses and electrically stimulating the cells. Nanoscientists have engineered nanomachines that can penetrate through a cell membrane wall. There are nanomachines that are equipped with nano pumps that are used to dispense drugs inside a cell. Nanoscientists have engineered nanomachines that can collect and store anticancer drugs. Digital sound waves transmitted from a medical team of nanoscientists is used to stimulate the nanomachines to release the anticancer drugs inside a cell. Nanomachines can manipulate the human muscular system by releasing poisonous toxins into muscle cells. Nanomachines implanted into the human anatomy may affect an individual in the following ways, visual hallucinations, programmable thought patterns, an increase of intelligence, a decrease of intelligence, change of speech, vocal cord manipulation, abnormal thought patterns, irregular heartbeat, relaxed heartbeat, improved respiratory health, and respiratory failure. Nanomachines can rapidly organize a vast supply of platelets to coagulate a wound. Nanomachines can release toxins within an injured area of the body which will worsen the injury. Nanomachines can be used to control and manipulate an individual's body and too can it be used to control the biology of an entire group of people. Nanomachine can be used for mental torture. The symptoms of nanomechanical torture are as follows, damaged nerve cells, disabling  parts of the cerebral cortex, poisoned internal organs, and disabling of the spine. Nanomachines can improve or worsen the immune system.  It is an evolutionary obligation that we as people must demand  nanotechnology to be legal and that our minds, bodies, and souls cannot be tortured by a government. The nanorobotic, nanomechanical, and nano computerized anatomy of the human eyeball.  There are many kinds of Optical nanorobots, Optical nanomachines, Optical grey goo nanorobots, Optical black goo nanorobots, and Optical nanocomputers that of which function differently according to both voluntary and involuntary muscles. There are Optical nanorobots, Optical nanomachines, and Optical nanocomputers that have been engineered to implanted into the anatomy of the eyeball and attach itself to cells that of which the Optical molecular robots, Optical molecular machines, and the Optical molecular computers are capable of injecting toxins or proteins into cells.

Light energy is converted into nerve impulses by the eye's photoreceptors. In order for light to be converted into nerve impulses, the light energy must break down molecules of a protein called rhodopsin. The mammalian eye which is a sense organ that gives animals the ability of sight by means of conscious light perception through color differentiation and perception of depth. ""The irregular spherical shape of the eye is a two-piece unit, with a frontal unit of which is transparent and more curved known as the cornea, which is linked to the larger unit the sclera."" 40% of the cerebral cortex ""the outer layer"" is involved with processing visual information and making sense of what we are seeing.  Optical Nanoparticles are transmitted into the muscular organ ""the eyeball."" The front part of the eye ""the cornea"" is the anterior chamber of which is transparent and covers the iris and pupil. The cornea accounts for about two-thirds of the eyes total Optical capabilities. The cornea and with the lens refract light. Nanoscientists have engineered many forms of nanodevices that have been engineered to program the cornea and lens of the human eye such as corneal nanorobots, corneal nanomachines, corneal nanocomputers, lens nanorobots lens nanomachines, and lens nanocomputers.

World governments have secretly engineered highly advanced computer programs which are used to advance the process of nanoparticle transfection. These highly advanced programs allow electronic stalkers to implant nanodevices into the human anatomy at incredibly accurate precise anatomical locations. These programs are used by fascist to implant nanoparticles into our biology from any electronic device within society. Unfortunately, nanoscientists are not allowed to use these advanced techniques of nanoparticle transfection for medical purposes. This is due to the secret fascist agenda of all world governments. Our fascist government that rules the United Microwave Concentration States of America with an iron militaristic totalitarian fist will not allow nanoscience to be taught as it should be. This is due to the pathetic US military does not want society to develop into a greater state of scientific progress. Our totalitarian government will only give the pleasures and medical benefits of nanotechnology to the rich. The iris is composed of smooth muscle tissues that form a thin circular structure of the eye. The iris is located between the cornea and the lens. The iris controls the size of the pupil and protects the eye from absorbing an excessive amount of light. Nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that have been engineered to bind and control with the anatomy of the iris are capable of sending and receiving radio, microwave, and ultrasonic signals of which are used to communicate with an outside source. Iridological nanorobots, Iridological nanomachines, and Iridological nanocomputers can manipulate the interior anatomy of a cell with its nanocomponents, specifically the ""mainmanipulators, nanomanipulators, and nanogrippers."" Irigological nanoparticles can either repair or harm a cell of the iris. Iridological nanoparticles are capable of releasing toxins into the iris.

The organic pumps of the Iridological nanoparticles are used to release medicines into the iris of which will then eliminate diseases. Iridological nanoparticles that are used for medical procedures by professionals which obtained a degree in nanoscience can be used to save lives and prevent loss of vision. The above may occur at any point in time through the daily interaction with our electronic devices. This is due to the fascist secret agenda of torturing, brainwashing, and programming our citizens in the United States and also in many other countries around the world such as China and Russia. An electronic stalker can transmit digital sound wave signals from any electronic device of which is capable of programming the Iridological nanoparticles to control and change the color of the iris into any artificial color that of which is computerized. Iridological nanoparticles are also capable of increasing and or decreasing the size of the pupil through the interaction of digital sound waves that have been transmitted from any electronic device by an electronic stalker. At the center of the iris is a hole called the ""pupil."" The pupil allows light to interact with the retina. The pupil is black due to the tissues of the pupils absorb the light rays that are interacting with the eyeball. Nanoscientists have engineered nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that have been specifically designed to control the pupil of the eye. These nanoparticles have been engineered to transmit laser beams of which are used to negate radio and microwave signals. Nanocrystals of an Optical nanoparticle creates cavities within the nanoparticles, that of which is measurably capable to the wavelength of a photon. Transmitted electrical signals of photons travel through a narrow space formed by the Optical nanoparticle crystals in parallel lines. A tiny electric current must occur within the Optical nanoparticles, in order for the phenomenon of transmitting photons from the nanolasers of the Optical nanoparticles to occur. Pupil nanoparticles have been engineered by nanoscientist to treat diseases which affect the pupil of the eyeball. Diseases such as third cranial nerve palsy (CN III). Pupil nanoparticles are biologically capable of triggering billions of chemical reactions within the anatomy of the pupil, of which can regulate abnormally dilated pupils which have developed due to abnormal light absorption. Pupil nanoparticles that are used for medical purposes by nanoscientist are capable of attaching themselves onto the cells of the pupil and injecting drugs that will be used to correct genetic mutations. Microscopic drugs that are released by the Optical nanoparticles have been synthesized within laboratories that were funded by the government, however, only the elite of society are able to get such medical treatments. An electronic stalker can illegally program the nanoparticles that have been engineered to control the pupil of the eyeball by transmitting electromagnetic from any electronic device that of which can be found within society. The pupil nanorobots, pupil nanomachines, and pupil nanocomputers are capable of providing computer data to the pupil of the eyeball. All of which will manipulate the color of the pupil into different kinds of computerized colors and designs. This is possible due to the fact that the pupil nanoparticles are capable of propagating radio and or microwave frequencies that can be used to manipulate a person's eyesight and to cause visual disturbances. Through digital sound wave signals that are transmitted from any electronic device by an electronic stalker. The digital sound wave signals carry binary data of which are transmitted to the DNA fragments of the Iridological nanoparticles. The digital sound waves of radio frequencies will then cause a chain reaction of biophoton emissions that will dictate the size of the pupil by regulating the quantity of light that has entered the pupil.  Nano scientists have engineered nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that have been engineered to program and control the two types of humor of the eyeball. These nanoparticles are capable of maintaining the size and shape of the eyeball. The large space behind the lens is filled with a gel-like substance called the vitreous humor it helps to maintain the shape of the eye and its intraocular pressure. Nanoparticles that have been engineered to program and control the vitreous humor are capable of transmitting radio, microwave, and or ultrasonic signals that are used to communicate with an outside source either a medical team or an electronic torturing stalker. These nanoparticles of the vitreous humor are used to give either poisons and or drugs into the vitreous body. The vitreous nanoparticles are also capable of detecting illnesses. The aqueous humor is produced by cells covering the ciliary body. Nanoparticles that have been engineered to control the aqueous humor are capable of disturbing the liquid flow between the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber by releasing poisons. Nanoscientists have engineered several different forms of ciliary body muscle nanorobots, ciliary body muscle nanomachines, and ciliary body nanocomputers which are implanted into the different muscles of the ciliary body. The ciliary body nanoparticles are transmitted into the superior oblique, superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior rectus, lateral rectus, and inferior oblique. Grey goo nanoparticles that are transmitted into ciliary body muscles have the organic molecular structure to rejuvenate damaged tendons by self-replicating inside the cells of the tendons. The grey goo matter will genetically enhance the DNA molecules. Nanoparticles that are implanted into the ciliary body have the medical capabilities of repairing damaged nerve fibers. Electronic stalkers are capable under this fascist dictatorship to send digital sound wave signals from any electronic device into our eyes. The electrical signals can program the nanoparticles of the ciliary body muscles to dictate the movements of the human eye. The nanoparticles can cause the eyeball to change in shape. Most of the involuntary movements of the eyeball occur when thoughts are manipulated by digital sound waves transmitted into the brain and electrically stimulate the neural nanoparticles. There are many different kinds of optical nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers for each part of the eye of which there are specific optical nanoparticles that contain specific artificial DNA fragments, of which allows the nanodevices to record information like a camera. The nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers of the retina are all capable of recording, manipulating, and sending electrical signals to the brain through the optic nerve. There are inter white goo nanorobots and inter white goo nanomachines that have been engineered by neuroscientist to be implanted into the human brain by means of particle transfection. The white cell neural nanoparticles are capable of recording the electrical signals sent from the optical nanoparticles and are too capable of converting the electrical signals into radio, microwave, and or ultrasonic signals that of which will be acquired by radio, microwave, and or ultrasonic signals that  were transmitted from either from a medical team of nanoscientist or an electronic stalker. The electrical signals will then be transmitted to a laboratory, where a network of advanced computers will convert the binary data from electrical signals into video sequences and or images of which electronic stalkers can use the data to see what a person is seeing. The anatomy of the retina is composed of millions of photoreceptors that of which work together converting light energy into the electrical signals that are sent to our brains through the optic nerve. Nanoscientists have engineered extremely complex nanodevices that are designed to be implanted and bond with the anatomy of the retina. These nanodevices are as follows Retinal nanorobots, Retinal nanomachines, and Retinal nanocomputers. These Retinal nanoparticles have been engineered to be implanted within the layers of the retina which are the inner limiting membrane, nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell layer, Inner plexiform layer, inner nuclear layer, external nuclear layer, external limiting membrane, layers of rods, layers of cones, and the retinal pigment epithelium. The retinal nanorobots, retinal nanomachines, and the retinal nanocomputers have been engineered to bond with the sensory neural networks of the retina. Each retinal nanorobot, retinal nanomachine, and retinal nanocomputer have been engineered to bond with the photoreceptors, bipolar neurons, and ganglion neurons by either replacing a neuron, penetrating itself into a neuron, embedding itself onto a neuron, and bonding itself to the synapse networks of the retinal sensory neurons. Digital sound wave signals that are transmitted into the eyeball can stimulate the nanoparticles of the retina to disturb the flow of information through the synapse neural networks of the retina, which can cause blindness. The opposite can accur wherein the synapse neural networks may be stimulated to improve eyesight. Each Retinal nanodevice possesses highly complex sets of artificial nucleotide chemical compounds that act as a kind of microscopic camera that is capable of converting light energy into electrical impulses. The artificial nucleotides of the nano retinal cameras converts photons that have reflected off of objects into electrical impulses which will then be sent to the brain through the optical nerve. The nanoparticles of the cerebral cortex will then correlate the electrical impulses into radio signals, microwave signals, and or ultrasonic signals that will then be picked up by electromagnetic radiation that has been transmitted by an electronic stalker and will then be sent to the location of the electronic stalker. The electrical signals will be converted into images and video sequences through a network of computers. Lens nanoparticles also help the manipulation of the refraction of light to be focused on the retina.

A white goo nanoparticle ""the white cell"" is an artificial cell that is either a nanorobot or a nanomachine that can self-replicate and replace cells. A white goo nanoparticle can attach itself to a cell by using its nanomanipulators to penetrate through the cell membrane. The white cell nanoparticle connects itself to other cells, either artificial cells or natural cells with the white goo artificial synapse and artificial dendrite connectors. There are nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles, and smart dust nanoparticles that have been engineered to be implanted into the human anatomy in order to penetrate into cells, thus giving a grey goo fascist control of our internal cellular anatomy and too can it also allow a medical team of nanoscientists the opportunity to treat people that are suffering from diseases such as cancer.

There are nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that are capable of self-replicating throughout the blood vessels of the human anatomy. Nanoparticles all radiate billions of biophotons from their artificial computers of DNA fragments which trigger billions of chemical reactions per second. The biophoton emission of nanoparticles is used to activate its nanocomponents that will be used to manipulate cells and microscopic matter. This light production is also used to control cells. Top-down approach Top down approach refers to slicing or cutting of a bulk material to get nano sized material. This is similar to making a stone statue. You take a bulk piece of material and modify it by carving or cutting stone, until you have made the shape you want. The process involves material wastage and is limited by the resolution of the tools you can use, Cause significant crystallographic damage to the processed patterns. Examples : various types of lithographic techniques. Bottom-up approach Bottom up approach refers to the build up of a material from the bottom: atom by atom; molecule by molecule or cluster by cluster. This is equal to the same approach one would take to build a house: one takes lots of building blocks and puts them together to produce the final bigger structure. There is less wastage with this technique, and strong covalent bonds will hold the constituent parts together. A good example of this kind of approach is found in nature; all cells use enzymes to produce DNA by taking the component molecules and binding them together to make the final structure. Cells are the smallest living units of an organism, all cells share three common characteristics. These three characteristics are as follows; cells have a cell membrane which separates the inside of a cell from its anatomical environment, cytoplasm which is a jelly-like fluid composed of protoplasm, and DNA which is the cell's genetic material. There are many different kinds of molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers that are capable of finding their way within a cell through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm. These molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers are as follows nanorobots, nanomachines, grey goo nanoparticles, black goo nanoparticles and smart dust nanoparticles. All of these forms of molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers interact with the organelles of a cell by attaching themselves onto an organelle and or penetrating into an organelle of a cell. Eukaryotic nanorobots, Eukaryotic nanomachines, Eukaryotic grey goo nanoparticles, Eukaryotic black goo nanoparticles, and Eukaryotic smart dust nanoparticles are molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers that are implanted within a Eukaryotic cell. Eukaryotic cells are more advanced cells found in plants and animals. Eukaryotic nanorobots that are implanted into a Eukaryotic cell can manipulate the genetic material of the cell and the molecular structures of its organelles. Eukaryotic nanorobots can do so by using their nano-components to manipulate the molecular structure of an organelle in order to form new chemical compounds. Eukaryotic nanorobots are equipped with nanomanipulators, nano grippers, nano-acoustic sensors, biomolecular nanosensors, nanoantennas, nanomagnets, nanomotors, and nano flagellum. Eukaryotic nanomachines are microscopic molecular machines that are capable of being implanted into a Eukaryotic cell, wherein DNA viruses will then be released into the cell and too can the Eukaryotic nanomachines produce protein synthesis. There are Eukaryotic nanomachines that use their helicase molecule as their main computer. The artificial helicase molecule can split DNA stands in two and move the DNA strands around using ATP. There are Eukaryotic nanomachines that use the enzyme molecule ""topoisomerase,"" these nanomachines are capable of unknotting DNA strands and rejoining them into sets of different sequences which cause hundreds of billions of chemical reactions. There are Eukaryotic nanomachines that use RNA nucleotide bonds to form nanocomponents such as nanomanipulators, nano grippers, nano-acoustic sensors, nanoantennas, and nanomagnets. There are Eukaryotic nanomachines that use many different strands of DNA molecules as nanocomputers which can emit biophotons of which triggers many specific chemical reactions that form different molecules of nano-components. Eukaryotic grey goo nanoparticles are either a kind of nanobot or a nanomachine that are capable of self-replicating and transforming molecules within cells into more Eukaryotic grey goo nanoparticles. Eukaryotic grey goo nanoparticles can multiply within a cell and transform the protoplasm of a cell into a grey goo substance of molecules that of which will transform the Eukaryotic cell into a grey goo cell. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can cause genetic superiority by eliminating genetic mutations that cause diseases. Eukaryotic black goo nanoparticles are made of an alien mineral oil substance that has been artificially turned into a nanobot and or a nanomachine. Black goo nanoparticles obtain their energy by causing genetic mutations that are extremely deadly to Eukaryotic cells. and Eukaryotic smart dust nanoparticles are molecular computers that are capable of attaching and penetrating itself within the Eukaryotic cell in order to sense and detect internal activities of cells. Nanorobots, nanomachines, and nanocomputers that are implanted within a Eukaryotic cell are nearly identical in terms of what they are capable of achieving within our biology, however, the major difference is that the molecular structure of each molecular robot, molecular machine, and or molecular computer differs from each other and the amount of information that each specific nanoparticle can correlate also differs from one another. Molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers will manipulate the genetic material of the cell and the molecular structures of the organelles within a cell by radiating biophotons that produce different colors of lights, that of which have emerged due to an outside interfering pulse modulated radio and or microwave signal that have provided binary information to the cellular molecular robots, molecular machines, and molecular computers. Ultrasound is also used to convey data to a cellular smart dust nanoparticle. The prokaryotic nanorobots, prokaryotic nanomachines, and prokaryotic nanocomputers have been developed in order to control unicellular organisms. The variety of prokaryotic nanoparticles are quite limited due to the fact that unicellular organisms are not of a major scientific importance to the grey goo fascist that are in power, it is our human anatomy that is of an importance to fascist. However, according to the grey goo scenario, all matter on earth will be transformed into grey goo nanoparticles. Therefore in the near future grey goo fascist will expand scientifically in terms of prokaryotic nanotechnology, in order to control the entire world. It is our duty as grey goo freedom fighters to develop and pass laws that will protect our freedoms from grey goo oppression and give us greater powers of grey goo medical benefits. We as people that believe in grey goo freedom must stand together and fight for higher forms of grey goo education for the public that will expand grey goo nanotechnology throughout the world in order to meet the grey goo scenario without losing our freedoms. Under this fascist regime of the United States government, grey goo nanoscience is a taboo and if taught is punishable by death. This is because the upper class of society which are fascist desire to control the lower average people with grey goo nanoparticles. grey goo nanoparticles can transform people into super humans that possess superior intelligence, superior strength, and superior beauty. The same technology can be used to control the minds and bodies of people and too can grey goo nanoparticles be used to cause genetic inferiority. The control center of the cell, the nucleus contains DNA or genetic material. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can manipulate the genetic material of a DNA molecule, however, Eukaryotic nanoparticles can only do so in different ways through different limitations. Eukaryotic nanoparticles found within the nuclear membrane can cause chemical reactions that will force the Chromatin ( which is the tangled spread out form of DNA found inside the nuclear membrane) these artificial chemical reactions will force a  cell to divide. The DNA then is forced to condense into structures known as chromosomes. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can trigger chemical reactions within the nucleus in order to form and produce ribosomes. This then leads to protein synthesis outside of the nucleus. The ribosomes and the rest of the organelles float around inside the cytoplasm. Ribosomes that are created through the chemical reactions of the Eukaryotic nanoparticles are then attached to the endoplasmic Reticulum ""ER."" There are two types of ER, which are rough endoplasmic reticulum which has ribosomes attached to it. The second is smooth ER of which does not have ribosomes attached to it. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can also attach themselves onto an ER. The endoplasmic reticulum is a membrane encoded passageway for transporting materials such as the proteins synthesized by ribosomes. Proteins emerge from the endoplasmic reticulum and in small vesicles where the Golgi apparatus receives them. The Eukaryotic nanoparticles can trigger the release of the small vesicles to the Golgi apparatus.  The mitochondrion is an organelle that is the nuclear power plant of both animal and plant cells. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can attach themselves onto the mitochondria and can also penetrate into the interior anatomy of the mitochondria. The Eukaryotic nanoparticles are capable of manipulating DNA found within the mitochondria. Eukaryotic nanoparticles can force cellular respiration to take place. Cellular respiration is the process of which the Mitochondria makes ATP molecules that provide energy for all the cell's activities. Cells that need more energy need more mitochondria. The nanorobots are built upon a single strand of DNA which is combined with short synthetic strands of DNA designed by the experts. When mixed together, they self-assemble into a desired shape.                                                                        Nano Manipulator grippers Manipulator grippers are able to grasp and hold micro and nano size objects.                                                                              Nano micromanipulator A micromanipulator is a device which is used to physically interact with a sample under a microscope, where a level of precision of movement is necessary that cannot be achieved by the unaided human hand. It may typically consist of an input joystick, a mechanism for reducing the range of movement and an output section with the means of holding a micro tool to hold, inject, cut or otherwise manipulate the object as required. The mechanism for reducing the movement usually requires the movement to be free of backlash. This is achieved by the use of kinematic constraints to allow each part of the mechanism to move only in one or more chosen degrees of freedom, which achieves a high precision and repeating of movements, usually at the expense of some absolute accuracy.                       Nano Manipulator  The nano Manipulator system consists of an optical scanning device, a computer interface and a physical manipulator. The scanning device, known as a scanned-probe microscope (SPM), can magnify images up to approximately 1,000,000 times. The computer interface provides a large, 3-D visual display and produces the effect of telepresence, giving users the impression that they are observing an enlarged replica of the object. The manipulator provides variable force and motion control, including tactile sensors and feedback devices that provide a ""feel"" for the object under examination. Sessions with the nano Manipulator can be shared among multiple users at diverse locations. The nano Manipulator has widespread applications in the physical and biological sciences. The device has been used to evaluate the characteristics of carbon nanotubes, polymers, living cells, disease pathogens, metal particles and microchips.                                 Main Nano Manipulator  Nano manipulation could be defined as the manipulation of nano meter sized objects with a nano meter size end effector with sub nano meter precision. By manipulation it is meant that nano  objects are pushed or pulled, cut, pick, and place, positioned, oriented, assembled, indented, bent, twisted, ect.  By controlling external forces with sensory feedback. Grouping nano manipulation systems can be conducted based on the usual starting point manipulator and object interaction process, utilized nano manipulators interaction and operation techniques. For applying an external force down on manipulators can be designed as a contact or non-contact type. Atomic Force microscopy AFM and scanning tunneling microscope STM probes are the most widely used metal manipulators using an STM probe. Manipulation of atoms or molecules by applying voltage pulse is between the probe. Grouping of mental manipulation systems depending on starting point utilizes process manipulators and objects interaction type and utilizes operation technique.                                    Nanosensors Nanosensors can detect various chemicals in gases for pollution monitoring. For medical diagnostic purposes either as blood borne sensors or in lab-on-a-chip type devices. To monitor physical parameters such as temperature, displacement and flow As accelerometers in MEMS devices like airbag sensors. When a molecule of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is present it will strip an electron from the nanotube, which in turn causes the nanotube to be less conductive. If ammonia (NO3) is present it reacts with water vapour and donates an electron to the carbon nanotube, making it more conductive. By treating the nanotubes with various coating materials, they can be made sensitive to certain molecules and immune to others. Nanosensors can detect single cells or even atoms, making them far more sensitive than counterparts with larger components.                    Nano acoustic sensor  Nano acoustic sensor attached to an on board computer, sends and receives ultrasonic signals to communicate with medical team.  A nano acoustic sensor can measure sound levels. They are called acoustic wave sensors because their detection mechanism is a mechanical (or acoustic) wave.                                Nano environmental sensors Nano environmental sensors detect environmental changes based upon sensing the external and internal environments of an organism, and for inducing muscle movement. Nano environmental sensors can monitor changes of touch, balance, taste, smell, hearing, and vision. Nano environmental sensors have been designed to receive information from the environment. Nano environmental sensors respond to stimuli through electrochemical communication.                   Nano dipole antenna  An optical nano dipole antenna is analyzed by means of its input impedance as well as the matching properties of the antenna topology and material configuration. A comparison of this classical microwave driving method with plane wave excitation is accomplished, contrasting the resonances in the input impedance and optical cross sections for several setups, and analyzing the spectral response shape. It is found that for all structures analyzed, a simple linear expression can be defined characterizing the relation between total dipole length and resonant wavelength. The fact that this linear relationship remains valid for different excitation models, for most widely used antenna materials (Au, Ag, Cu, and Al) and even in the presence of substrates is important with respect to practical designs. To our knowledge, such an extensive study has not been performed before. Nano-antennas are the optical equivalent of antennas that are used to transmit and receive information at radio frequencies. These antennas have been used in different applications in photonics such as optical imaging, particle manipulation, bio-sensing, and improvement of the performance of solar cells. In this article we study composite nano-antennas made of alternating layers of silica and gold.                                                                                    link-up connector  All nanorobots will have a link-up connector to use power resources from bigger nanobots.  This helps the nanorobots perform more complicated tasks. The larger nanorobot is then linked to the smaller nanorobots and as a result provides electrical data to the smaller nanorobots that will be used to instruct the smaller nanorobots to do a specific job. The larger nanorobot remain in full control of the smaller nanobots.                                                           locomotion flagella  locomotion flagella is a slender threadlike structure, especially a microscopic whiplike nanometer scale appendage that enables nanorobots to swim. The locomotion flagella allows nanorobots to travel through the circulatory system, maneuvering  through the blood vessels and avoiding blood cells if required.   Flagellar pneumatic connectors  Flagellar pneumatic connectors enable the nanorobots to connect to cells and walk around in our cells. Flagellar pneumatic connectors also allow nanorobots to extract chemicals as a means of generating energy.                    Nanomanpulator site  Nanomanipulator site is molecular compound site where the nanomanipulators connect to and receive information on how the nanomanipulators will function.     The white cell is a nanorobot that is an artificial cell that has been created to bond with and or replace existing cells. The white cell is known as the white goo, which is a self-replicating nanobot that can travel through the circulatory system, killing pathogens and cells. The white cell contains many nano manipulator systems, which consists of optical scanning devices, artificial DNA substances that serves as a computer interface, and a physical manipulator which is capable of penetrating the cell membrane in order to manipulate the internal anatomy of the cell, this is of extreme medical importance, due to the fact that the nano manipulators of a white cell nanorobot can use it's manipulators to revive injured cells and or manipulate harmful protoplasm mutations. A white cell consists of many manipulator grippers that are able to grasp and hold micro and nano size objects. The white cell manipulator grippers are also used to attach itself onto a cell body. The white cell contains many nano acoustic sensors of which each are attached to it's own artificial DNA molecule which acts as an on board computer. The white cell acoustic sensors sends and receives radio signals, microwave signals, and ultrasonic signals to communicate with a medical team. The white cell possesses nano-antennas which are used as an optical equivalent of antennas, of which are used to transmit and receive information at radio frequencies.  White cell nanorobots possess link-up connector that are used to link other smaller white cell nanobots together into a common power resource that is provided from the largest white cell nanobot. The White cell has a nanomagnet built into it that allows nanoscientist to control its movements. The white cell contains nanosynapses and nanodendrites. White cells are equipped with multiple biological sensors which detects chemicals and reactions within it's anatomical environment. These nanorobots can self-replicate by dividing into multiple white cells that may vary in size and transform into different cells that of which originate in a specific organ. White cell nanorobots can be used to treat and or cure amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The white cell nanobot consist of many nano computers that radiates hundreds of billions of biophotons per second, as a result the white cell (white goo) illuminates a white shine. There are three types of white cells, the first is the sensory white cell which gets information about what's going on inside and outside of the body and brings that information into the central nervous system in order for it to be processed, the second is the motor white cell, which receives electrochemical impulses from other motor white cells and other cells and as a result conveys commands to the muscles, organs and glands, the third is the Inter white cells which are found only in the central nervous system, the inter white cell connects each cell to one another. The inter white cell receives electrical stimuli from other cells and or white cells, such as sensory neurons, sensory white cells, inter neurons, and or inter white cells, and send electrochemical impulses to other cells and or white cells, such as motor neurons, motor white cells, inter neurons, and or inter white cells. White cell nanorobots operate within our anatomy through digital sound wave signals that may be transmitted from a medical team of nano scientist and or a fascist electron stalker. The White cell (white goo) can cure many diseases and save the lives of billions of people around the world, however at the same time it may also be used to harm and kill billions of people around the world. Barack Hussein Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Michelle Obama have tortured me by implanting highly detailed life-like computerized images of themselves by means of transmitting a quantum electrical signal that of which interacts with the optical nanobots that are implanted into my eyes!  The actions of the computerized images of Obama are as follows, giant hologram images of Obama's head attacking me from the sky, Obama stabbing me while I walk, Obama spitting into my face, Obama spitting into my ear, Obama spitting into my food and drinks, Obama manipulating my dreams, Obama raping me in my own head, Obama implanting computerized dreams of him raping me, Obama licking my ear, Obama sucking my penis, Obama licking and sucking my anus, images of Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Michelle Obama opening their mouths and as they do so, they then stimulate a crackling sensation in my ears, Obama possessing my body while I pray, Obama open mouth kissing me, Obama murdering my family and crucifying them onto a wall, Obama attacking and raping my siblings, of which are children, Obama appearing in all of my past memories, and Obama forcing me to obey him in my dreams! Hillary Clinton is torturing me by implanted thoughts of her screaming ""war"" in my head, Hillary Clinton appearing as a demon creature, Hillary Clinton has implanted poisonous nano chips in my brain, Hillary Clinton releasing crackling sounds from my abdomen, and Hillary Clinton manipulating my dreams in order to torture me as I sleep! Joe Biden is torturing me by implanting thoughts into my brain of him stabbing me, raping me, spitting at me, shooting at me, punching me, implanting his name into my brain for over 350 thousand times in the past 16-17 months and continuing to do so everyday of my life that of which causes me to experience severe twitching! As a result of the implanted artificial thoughts of the name ""Joe Biden,"" I could see his name and image wherever I would look, for example; I would see his name in the sky, the moon, in the clouds, my eyes, and forehead as I would look in a mirror! The following is how Michelle Obama is torturing me, Michelle Obama possesses my body daily, Michelle Obama implants thoughts into my brain of her stabbing me, hitting me, manipulating my face by enlarging lips, forcing me to act like a woman, Michelle Obama tortures me while I am asleep by implanting computerized nightmares in my brain, and Michelle Obama implanted a computerized dream in my brain of her raping me! All of this punishment in the form of mind control torture has been brought upon me because I made a short video explaining that Obama is not African American, because his father is from East Africa ""Kenya,"" not West Africa, and that Obama is not genetically related to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr! Governments are programming and torturing people with nanotechnology. While living in California, where I was tortured the most by Obama, I was gasping for air begging Obama to stop implanting the name ""Joe Biden"" into my brain. Obama's response via a telepathic electrical signal was ""no, I killed 700 Muslims do you know what I can do to you?"" Obama then sent an electrical signal into my brain wherein I saw and felt him open mouth kissing me. The 700 Muslims that Obama was referring to were the 717 Muslims that died on September 26, 2015, in a stampede during hajj. Obama and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia sabotaged the stampede in order to manipulate the economies of the countries that represented the pilgrims of those that attended Hajj during September 26, 2015! Obama, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev the world's greatest fascist have illegally implanted millions of Nanobots into the brains and bodies of innocent people including both Americans, Russians, Europeans, Asians, Australians, and Africans! Barack Hussein Obama has secretly traded nanobot technology information with the Russian Federation under the leadership of Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev! While living in California where I was tortured the most, Barack Hussein Obama gave permission to his secret agents to purchase highly lethal poisonous nanobot technology from the Russians of which Barack Hussein Obama's secret agents used the technology against me in order to poison my brain! I as a result from the poisonous nanobot brain implants have developed severe pain in the form of bumps on the lower left side of my head!   Vladimir Putin has used nanobot technology to implement physical restraint without an outside physical force against me while I protested on ""Facebook"" against him and the fascist dictator Obama! Barack Hussein Obama has given permission to Vladimir Putin and his KGB spies to torture me while I slept by waking me and forcing me to suffer from sleep deprivation! Barack Hussein Obama, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev have threatened to kill me by implanting highly poisonous Nanobots into my anatomy! The fascist dictators ""Barack Hussein Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev have not shown any remorse for  the victims of electronic mind control! Therefore I do conclude that it is of the best interest of the common person to rebel  against all fascist rule in the world!  Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev have illegally tested electromagnetic radiation wave attacks against their own people! Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev are manipulating the minds of millions of innocent Russians and torturing innocent people night and day over acts of freedom! Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev along with their military advisors are using  nanotechnology to manipulate the Russian economy! The Russian military is torturing innocent people from Ukraine by controlling the minds and bodies of the Ukrainians through nanobot technology! The victims of mind control torture in Ukraine are suffering from nanobot mind control rape! Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev are sabotaging the entire process of obtaining Liberty and freedom around the world! Barack Hussein Obama, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev are equal in terms of dictating people and all share similar forms of political movements in terms of governing and ruling a nation? Therefore I conclude that the world's most powerful leaders are mind controlling dictators that adore fascism as much as Hitler did while he was alive. Barack Hussein Obama, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Donald Trump, the fascist Democrats, and the fascist Republicans must stand trial for the expansion of nanobot brain implantation and microscopic electrode brain implantation in the United States and also in many foreign countries!   Barack Hussein Obama, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and every last fascist democrat must stand trial for the illegal implantation of nanochips into the human brain and body! In the following are detailed technological mind controlling nanobot capabilities that Barack Hussein Obama is using against innocent Americans such as myself 'Wael Ghafarji,"" in order to telepathically torture people that disagree with him!   The constant microwave attacks from all angles have completely destroyed me as an individual the constant fear that I may commit suicide to escape the pain and misery of my life. My overwhelming tears when I sit with my loved ones of which are children and the constant fear that they too may be targeted by the fascists grey goo government that is in power. Being the only individual in the entire country that can see all the microwave weapons that of which have been disguised as electronic devices and have been implemented within society for the sole purpose of Mind Control is the most terrifying and shocking realization of reality. I now understand that we do not live in the United States of America but rather the United Grey Goo Fascist Microwave Concentration States of America. I'm tired of cutting myself, I'm tired of losing my reality, and I wish that the pain of mind control torture would stop. I was informed through RF hearing effect that powerful satellites transmitted rapid frames of advance radio signals back in time when I was a child.   The super quantum satellites orbiting our planet can send electrical signals back in time to a specific location that of which will interact with the nanobots of the brain of a person and or people that lived during the 1980s, 1990s, and up until the twenty-first century. However, there is a possibility that the satellites can release highly powerful electromagnetic radiation waves that can manipulate the thoughts of a person or people that do not yet have nanobots implanted into their brains before the 1980s! Nanobots have been a worldwide government project for the past eighty years! It is only recently of the year 1970 to the year 1980 that world governments began to implant nanobots into our brains! Nanobots have greatly advanced since the 1980s and the methods of implanting nanobots into our anatomy have also significantly advanced! I as a child was visited by two powerful nanobot cyborgs from the future! I was tortured and experimented on while I was asleep! I had many computerized nightmares! Before being visited by the nanobot cyborgs, my family and I went to California to visit my dying grandfather. The night that my family and I returned from California to New York, was when my life changed forever. I later that night was visited by the first nanobot cyborg, which appeared to me outside my window at the age of nine. It appeared after I heard a loud sound that seemed like an energy disturbance that came from the back of my house. It stood by the wall of my old garage, where there was absolutely no electronic devices. The nanobot cyborg appeared as a hunched over eight foot tall alien with large black eyes. The nanobot cyborg was pointing down. The nanobot cyborg wanted me to leave my bed and walk to it. The nanobot cyborg was sent from the future by people that wanted to protect me from the future attacks that I was going to suffer from, for my entire childhood, teenage youth, and adulthood.  Before appearing outside my window it communicated to me telepathically, saying ""if I look outside my window, will I see Bigfoot?"" Once I saw what was outside my window at the age of nine, I paid close attention to its physical details. After seeing the nanobot cyborg, I became quite afraid and hurried to my brother's bed on the other side of the room.  I looked out my window again and saw the same nanobot cyborg stretching over in front of my window with its arms propelled outwards. However, it no longer had eyes. The Radiation of the nanobot cyborg would have possessed me if I had I walked to that spot where it was pointing, I would have had advance nanoparticles transmitted into my anatomy. The nanoparticles would have protected me from all forms of microwave attacks and radio frequency attacks. The nanobot cyborg which was programmed to look like an alien saved my life and the lives of my family members. The of the nanobot cyborg that appeared as an alien to me at the age of nine was composed of time traveling future nanocomputers. The second nanobot cyborg that I saw, was about a week or two later. It appeared at the side of my sister's bed in my little sister's room, where I was sleeping. It woke me up and said, ""hey Wally, did you see the wolfman?"" A few days earlier I saw a documentary of werewolves. This second nanobot cyborg was short, green, and had many black holes throughout its body. It's telepathic voice sounded like a fully grown German man. This is known as project Bigfoot, aka the wolfman. Those that were watching me from the future knew what I was watching. The wolfman, I believe was the first nanobot cyborg ""the alien.""  I was a targeted individual for my entire life. I was programmed for my entire life. During the day as a child, while I was awake I had many torturing artificial thoughts that were implanted into my brain. One artificial thought at the age of seven was a pale man that was wearing a black suit, I asked him what is your name, and he then replied ""God."" I was tortured by this man for 7 to 9 days. Even until this day he hasn't left me. It seems though from my deliberate attempts of protesting against nanobot electromagnetic torture on Facebook, twitter, YouTube, and my websites, I have angered people from the future. Those that I have angered  used time traveling technology to alter my past, so that I would not be able to expose the nanobot mind controlling corruption of all world governments! In the house that I was living in, where I saw the first two nanobot cyborgs from the future, I noticed that while I was watching television that there were three grown men staring at me and listening to me from the television. This would mean that all the TVs in the house were being monitored and that microwave attacks were being transmitted from the televisions. I was followed since I was 7 and up until this very day. The United States has been attacking me since I was a child, I have been at war with this fascist Morgellons disease government since I was born. The sound of the energy like disturbance that I heard before seeing the first nanobot cyborg outside from my window can be used to attack people. Our televisions and electronics can transmit radiation waves that can either cure or cause mental illnesses. The sound of the energy like disturbance is a type of powerful portal that can release that can alter reality. These portals can emerge without making a sound.  My family and I were under attack from the future and the US government used time traveling portals to torture us. The first nanobot cyborg that I saw was proof that such portals were being used against me and my family. The fact that I was able to hear and see something from the future was a sign of help and that a time traveling war was and is taking place. The first nanobot cyborg that I saw when I was nine is still in my life and I see it every day, I see the great alien in the mountains, the trees, the sky, the moon, the ground, in flowers, in food, in drinks, in mirrors, in the faces of my family members, I see the great nanobot cyborg in paintings, the floor, in clothes, in water, I see the great alien in my dreams, and I see the great alien in my fingers. The great alien that I saw when I was a child is taking the pain away, I just wish that I left my room that night and walked to the great alien. The closer I am to the nanobot cyborg, the safer I am. In my real reality, the US government murdered my family with microwave attacks and the US government decided to use the time traveling technology to target me as a child so that I wouldn't be as successful in exposing nanotechnology and the advancements of electromagnetism. The great alien was my guardian angel. It watched me from the trees, the sky, the moon, my food, the walls, the floor, paintings, clouds, the stars, in my clothes, my video games, my electronics, in my childhood cartoons that I watched, my fingers, my hands, and my eyes. It protecting me in the dark as a child but as much as they did to save me, I still suffered horribly.  Those that sent the nanobot cyborg back in time when I was a child are protecting me from microwave attacks and radio frequency attacks.   My protection from electronic torture increases as is I think of that day when I was nine and I first saw that great nanobot alien cyborg outside my window. To those that went back in time and saved my life by preventing many of the future attacks against me. I greatly am thankful and I do owe my life to those brave men and women. Thank you all for protecting my family and I from electronic nanobot mind control torture and I greatly am thankful to those incredible people that went back in time to save my life. I have learned to resist the microwave and radio frequency attacks by meditating on that night when I saw the alien nanobot cyborg. I for the past two years have been brainwashed by Donald Trump and those that work for him to post many comments on electronic harassment and nanobot mind control on the youtube videos, facebook accounts, and twitter accounts of Obama, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and anyone that Donald Trump disliked. If I didn't post comments the torture would worsen, it reached the point where it didn't matter if I posted comments or not. I would still be under horrible electronic torture by the US military. Donald Trump forced me through microwave auditory hearing effect and radio frequency hearing effect that I must, no matter what, if I wanted to breath that I had no choice but to post comments all day. What made things worse is that Obama and Donald Trump were both torturing me. I spent nearly 12 to 15 hours a day posting comments on nanotechnology and electronic torture. I was not allowed to post any comments about the medical benefits of nanotechnology. I was starving because I spent all of my money to pay my phone bill in advance for the internet connection while being tortured. I was very poor and homeless, Donald Trump used me for cyber warfare and in the end, he was going to kill me and my family with the most powerful forms of pure mind control microwave torture. Those that sent the nanobot cyborg back in time when I was nine years old are now at war with Obama, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Joe Biden, the democrats, and the republicans. I no longer have to post comments on youtube, facebook, and twitter to breath. I just need to meditate on that night all day and I will not be tortured. I am being protected by those great people that send the nanobot cyborgs back in time seventeen years ago. The computerized nightmares have ended, the electrical signals that cause computerized thoughts and brain damage are being blocked, I am no longer seeing any visual computerized hallucinations, however I do see many aliens around me.  When I close my eyes and meditate, I begin to see green energy in my thoughts and as I continue to meditate the green energy turns into aliens. The green energy that I am seeing in my thoughts are being used to heal the parts of my brain that have been under attack by electrical signals. The green energy that I am thinking of as I meditate is coming from radio and microwave signals that are being transmitted from outer space and from the future. I am receiving radio signals from the future. Most of the attacks against me from the US military are being blocked by satellites in outer space. When I look into a mirror in a dark room, I see my eyes transforming into alien eyes and I see behind me the same alien nanobot cyborg stretching with its arms propelled outwards. If only he protected me, if only Donald Trump wasn't a lying mind controlling fascist electronic stalker, if only the US military believed in freedom, if only our government wasn't a fascist grey goo dictatorship. I of my choice will post comments of nanotechnology and the advancements of electromagnetism on the youtube videos, facebook channels, and the twitter accounts of Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Barack Hussein Obama, Joe Biden, and the next vice president for the next 8 years of Donald Trump's presidency. Under the authority of those that have the powers of time travel, all nations must declare economic warfare against the United States. I am not an American.  Please visit my websites www.nanobotbrainimplant.com www.nanobotmindcontroltorture.com www.obamabraininitiative.org www.obamabraininitiatives.org www.nanobotmindcontrol.com",8년 전,0,

@xXxTr0nxXx,"Panda Uhm yes. You can be 100% sure that an instituion like the NSA is under constant threat of cyber attacks from russian or  chinese side. And my jerking off statement was clearly a joke, it should be obvious to anyone that there is information from much more important people/instituitions which isnt illegal but still worth keeping hidden. On top of that in the ages of digitalisation so many companies have their reports and data stored online, easily busable if you get access.",9년 전,5,
@itmattersnot1216,"No one should have to explain to you why it's not okay for our government to disregard our rights and break it's own laws. You may be innocent but a corrupt government may disagree. Your putting your trust in them to be honest and use the information appropriately but what they've done shows they can't be trusted.  Have you ever jokingly said I wanted to kill that guy or maybe just disagreed with or questioned or insulted the president in a private conversation? If so they could use that information to say that you conspired to murder someone or to prove that you're a terrorist. God forbid there's a terrorist attack in your area and they need someone to pin it on. Surprise you're it. Maybe someone you had a fight with once gets killed. Now thanks to something you said about her to a friend months ago, you're a suspect.  Not to mention the hundreds of other illegal things that dirty government could do with a more important persons personal information.  Are you getting the idea yet?",9년 전,23,

I said they could accuse you of being a terrorist and more they can imprison you for that for as long as they want with no proof no charges and no trial. But I see now that we've been trying to talk sense into a rock. People as blind, stubborn and stupid as you may need to be monitored, manipulated and controlled for your own safety. I just wish that the rest of us Americans weren't lumped in with the likes of you.

More women spontaneously abort than get medical abortions.  Are you donating to research for that?  Instead of being a religious nut case and interfering with a woman’s right to own her own body, why don’t you lobby for better daycare and universal healthcare so that all mothers and children can have medical attention.   If you love children, why don’t you work to get control over the guns in your country?  USA is the only country where gun shot is the second leading cause of death in children after all accidents (including car accidents) combined!   No, you’d rather stick your nose in someone else’s business and whine about their choices.   If you can’t be bothered to actually help children, then get out of the damn way with your grousing and complaining so the rest of us can try to help.   Become a foster parent, lobby for change politically,  visit children in hospital, become a scout leader or Big sister or donate to build a playground in your area.  I’ve volunteered my whole life for children with disabilities. I’m now 63 and I’m blind.  I’m no longer a foster parent but I still grow a large backyard garden and deliver many pounds of fresh veggies to a women’s and children’s centre every year.  I also volunteer for my local school.   If you care so much about children, what do you do for them??  What is needed in your area?  How do you help?   I’d love to hear about the programs you are running in your community.  You might have some great ideas to share.  I really hope that you are a better person than your comment suggests and that I’ve been unduly harsh with my opinion of you.

Plus she likes  to dictate how we should live our lives such as what to eat etc😍🤮! Inviting Black panthers  to the White House and  Muslim brothers and Obama taking Jesus out Of Military and God out  of our schools the list goes on and if that is upsetting anyone go to your safe room like they have for our collage students who should be learning how to debate rather than run and hide because it hurts their feelings !  So people learn how to stand straight instead of crumbling when the truth is told or  least Give a common sense debate with actual facts  What I’ve said was on TV  Or read which can be verified by fake news  which you yourselves believe !! But of course it wasn’t fake because they never say anything fake about Obama do they!?!! Such as how squeeky clean his administration was with no scandal !! That’s the   Iggest fake news there is!

Here is the problem, the person getting the Most Votes doesn’t necessarily win an Election, and with the rezoning of the states which determine the amount of their Electoral Vote has changed everything. I Voted against Hilary last election ( but you see under an Only 2 Party System we are only given 2 legitimate Candidates) which means I Voted for Trump. What a huge mistake! Trump has no plan for anything, our economy, our foreign policy, our countries deficit (which now is the largest in the History of the US), Civil Rights, and the list can go on and on. He just attacks every candidate (a tactic he learned from Roy Cohn, Mob Boss Attorney that mentored him), and stands for nothing. He ran on make America Great Again and when you asked him how, he has no answer, just attacks the last administration or someone else, this is his MO. We used to have candidates that during their debate, they were asked these questions. But thanks to Ronald Regan which the Republicans love, did away with the Fairness Act, in which News Agencies must give both sides to each story and have a moral compass. Now even our News Agencies are not to be trusted as they too have their own agenda. So who do we trust?

@MaskMasterEsquire," @josephavera3223  I truly do not align with either side, Trump v Dem....either way you end up with a criminal. The key difference (as I have previously stated) is that at least with Trump, most rational people can see he's corrupted. With Obama, too many people thought he was the messiah. Meanwhile he bombed poor countries back to the stone age and shoveled squillions to his bankster buddies. Our media in Australia demonise Trump but adore the Dems and it's nauseating to watch that level of bias. I think they only possible solution (apart from a supernatural intervention) is for the American people to act on the provisions that were put in place in your Constitution to deal with a corrupt future govt.

How tough it is to be black in Princeton!  There is a very good reason neither of them release their grades. Everything they have was given to them because they are black, including the White House. They have fucked up their executive position in a way probably never seen before in history. Bush was miserable, but the Obama's are on a whole different level of failure.

I'll keep a bunch of that on hand in my fridge to bake in the days after I prep the bean patties. I've been vegetarian since 2006. When I have vegan options I go vegan. I drink only soy milk for instance. I haven't found any truly vegan cheese in this area in my price range. The local dairy isn't a horror show like some places. The cows are generally pasture fed. I haven't seen that there's any factory farms in the area. So farmers treat the livestock more like what was the historical norm. But in area's with big cities, where factory farms are normal, cows never live any kind of normal life, they're just pent up in cages. I get the impression out here by how the cows are about the fields that they live ordinary lives, bare offspring, raise young, swell up to enormity as adults then pass away fulfilled as having passed the torch to the young adult cows. As compared to factory farm conditions, the tortured living of the animals in the factory farms is so depraved an abuse that no sane human being would tolerate such abuses being served to them as fleshy carcass to saw and chew.",9년 전,0,
@danielvincentkelley,"A Human - Nah, I'm factually disgusted by this filth, that's why I'm obliged to ridicule it for what it is, a vastly murderous train wreck recruiting goons into it's plundering folds, buying these effen turds with paper cash, exactly like the fkn idiots they are to take the bait, they're all submitting their crimes to their blackmailers catalog, to the extent that the whole of the Official State, from coast to coast, everywhere between local authorities to the Federal monstrosity, it's all owned by blackmail, every of these fkn turds can get cooked by the revelation of what their lives have already been. So, it's a bit unnerving being surrounded by such in-yer-face corruption. I've been pissing off the worst of it, so I have that going for me. For me it's a badge of honor to talk shit daily about the bankers and the bankers goons, all these war for profit powers that are drunk on the power of slaughtering babies for war profits. I just imagine that some day the world will be rid of these monstrous goons and I take my life as an opportunity to do what will best contribute to obliterating the evil that is entrenched on this planet and in this solar system. I think in deep distant space the treachery gets less until we meet up with some like minded peaceful vegan beings. That's what my guess is on who is far out there. But who is here in this system, is a long lived treachery struggling in fear of death to survive. That single fleshy immortal space turd being who dominates this solar system and obliterates humanity to near extinction, bashing humanity out of modernity and even to the extent that his militant treachery imposes stone age conditions against human organization. Finding that 1 fleshy immortal turd who has been running a regular ruin on the planet and submitting humanity to dark ages, I consider it the chiefest priority for all humanity to accomplish, not merely finding him, but eradicating him, to ensure the whole galaxy and universe is rendered void of his influence, certainly that he loose grasp on this star system, that humanity act smart to render his influence null. A being so treacherous and singular as such, would likely take to flight from a star system if beings wide enough to trounce him were woken to his presence. So, we might do well to hunt him in proximity to this solar system and as far as might be required to reach him and ensure his termination has occurred to the extent he's rendered ash. But we're factually in a hard place to be, where his dominance seems to have expressed longer than 13,000 year old space weapons, like the dark knight satellite. So, whenever people get smart to his treachery, he's as likely to blast the planet in a tantrum and batter humanity into such long term devastation, that nobody remains who knows how to read or write. That the battery of humanity persist beyond then even until when the history being taught is so misunderstood that it's cryptic to an extent that sharing it is some what meaningless, that it's all regarded as myth and legend, it's regarded as fanciful imaginings of gifted story tellers. Anyhow, that's all I'm saying, is this train wreck is mad old and this generation signing on to it's horror, is in for a rude awakening when it's their turn to fuel this beast.",9년 전,0,

I would never comment saying that a woman is dressed too conservatively/slutty, but I will say that those pants look really weird. I would expect that from Lady GaGa or Bjork, as they wear outlandish stuff to get attention, but I would say usually Mrs. Obama dresses with the class and elegance befitting her personality. This is just strange, and reminds me of some kind of experimental clothing you might see on a pretentious French runway. I still love and admire her for many reasons, just saying that was a strange choice and was a bit distracting. Again, it usually bothers me when people comment on a female politicians clothing, because it is usually about saying it is too frigid/sexual, but if you wear something akin to parachute pants (male or female), that deserves a ""wtf?"". P.S. Pants aside, every time I hear her speak, I find myself wishing that she was our first female President; she is worthy of going down in history as breaking that barrier. Although I hope Clinton defeats Trump, I think the historical moment is wasted on her, just as Barack was worthy of being our first black President, but it would have been wasted on Ben Carson. If we are going to elect a former first lady, she deserves that honor. Oh, well. I guess she will have to settle for being the first black First Lady... hopefully she might be our second female President, and our first female black President!? Michelle 2020!?",9년 전(수정됨),0,

Kudos to$11 whomever pointed out the JAILHOUSE SLOP she's $t$ried to force down OUR blue-collar, hard-working families children when HER/HIS--whatever over fed offspring stuff THEIR gullets with with ONLY THE FINEST richest  French, Italian, Hawaiian, on location TRUE Kenyan (as it(he\she\it) slipped during a press conference and sfsted how ""nice it had been to visit her husband's TRUE birthplace (oopsie)  WELL we already knew just like the Clinton's they were lying liarery LIARS  and Whatever else either their private chef or Airforce One can afford them!!!  it's truly sickening cuisine --seriously I think they were ALL CHASING SOME THING- Bill, some hot intern who he wouldn't have to turn the lights out and gag if it spoke... Liary's penchant for old wrinkly broads that work for her & as Eminem says "" Loves the way she lies...."" then before the friendship fell apart-Liary's total devotions and backing to Barry Soerentoe's compete lie about every single thing including his very OWN NAME!!$$$$   i think she admired HIS ability to deceive more than Bill's--I'm even sorta feeling a little sorry for Bill (words I thought Id NEVER EVER SAY THAT!!!!)  BUT lately as Liary's been losing her mind, shoes, train of though and gross green gobs of what some would say i all the sepsis and posion and evil, lies, deceit trickery and treason that left out men sitting ducks, then slaughtered after cries numerous cries for lp became CLEARLY IT WAS WITHOUT A SHADOW OF ANY OF A DOUBT---her main focus????  ??  ""What difference does it REALLY MATTER?.......  YOU incessantly rambling shrew!!!!  IT MATTERS!!!!!! IT WILL ALWAYS MATTER.  MY FAMILY IS A MILITARY FAMILY FROM GENERATIONS NOW DOWN TO MY BROTHER'S ONLY SON.  NOW HE'S STATIONED IN THE STATES NOW BUT IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE that can change forever--don't get me wrong--he has NO dissolution about having to right and just like my father and his before him, he will suit up and right for our county Glod Bless you Kevin!!!  however.  NEVER over for the soldier or his family or his children.  I know that as mentally and physically strong was then and still is today war takes a piece of your soul if you are not careful.  so much more so if you do not have the mental capacity to be a mentally capable and strong MAN and believe with your heart and soul in fighting for YOUR COUNTRY AND THE LAND THAT YOU LOVE- THE FLAG-YOUR FREEDOMS--THE CONSTITUTION AND OUR FAMILY AND FRIEND'S SAFETY.  If not--it can and WILL break you to pieces.   BUT I watched the strongest man I've EVER known- still limping from his sniper wounds after marrying mom-having me, take care of his family by working as a Police Officer which was at best military survival during the dead of night- and tske 2 other jobs just to keep us in a small tralier with enough to est and ONE car.  he NEVER called out sick, he NEVER complained, even once we were on our way home from church late on a Sunday night and a drunk picked the VERY wrong car to smash his beer bottle on.  dad just yelled ""lock the doors and don't MOVE, Ill be right back!!""  Long story short, I got to watch MY daddy arrest that kid all crying (by himself) and sudue about 6 others.  the kid Apparently led my dad, who was wearing a suit & tie, straight into a drug house-dad received a commendation for that because he went beyond the call of duty, especially becasue he was always thinking ahead!!!  MY point is--he ALWAYS put HIS fellow MAN Ms Fellow Americans before himself--not to fill a shadow box one day or anything- he did it because out of the ""ethical man"" and the ""moral man"" he's without a doubt and without hesitation the moral man-this is something that cannot be learned or taught or trained or learned on a Webinar (sorry IRS)  H Clinton has NEVER had nor will she ever ""suddenly""aquire"" a Morals.  SHE is quite simply a sociopathic individual.  sociopathic persons cannot grow or suddenly feel sympathy or empathy for those they deem beneath them.  They do not now nor will they EVER believe it is they who have an issue or issues but that it is literally they entire world at large who are ignorant, stupid, wrong, or she who phrased it best, ""a basket of deplorables,"" simply because these people simply didn't act as sheep led to slaughter.  which is extremely delreadful and verrrry verrrry dangerous to have these psychosis so firmly deepseated in the mind of the mind of the leader of the free WORLD--mind you the most powerful position to date.  If she had one of her kind of drugged and confused moments....WOW or passed out and fell again losing shoes all over the tarmac?  ALSO?  would they go so far as to put a electric wheelchair strairclimber one Air force ONE?  Imagine, crowds would either just not show up anymore; or worse, they'd be 45 minutes late as not to waste time whilst the chair took about as long to decend as her flight from DC to FL took.  Then the departure would just be always TOO pathetic--no one would appear for her hourl long ascension shot..... in then--she's mad at florida and makes a c completely rash decision to annihilate Florida because she's a sociopath and no one will stop her!!!!!!   DC this is just one example of what horrible thing could happen if Liary takes office in the Whitehouse!!!!!!  also AMERICA AS WE KNOW IT WILL TRULY BE GONE--EVEN MORESO THAN WHAT THAT BARRY SORENTOE(A/K/A Barack Obama) HAS DONE WITH HIS ""APOLOGY TOURS (a/k/a "" I'm so sorry that I'M the leader of he greatest nation to ever have existed.  even though we are only two hundred or so years old and you guys have continued to ask to and seem our .military advice and helo when needed... whelp---awww---we're not gonna do that anymore.  we are all real sorry--not really sure why- but we aren't gonna help ourselves, or anyone else for that matter-except for he radical Jihadist groups and probably those what are they MOOSH?

He DID continue Fast and Furious and got border agents killed.  He DID oversee a Wall Street that got 24% richer after the Great Recession. He DID increase spying mechanisms on American citizens.  He DID move to allow US Citizens to be detained on mere suspicion of terrorist activity without trial or proof.  He DID pass into law the right for America to assassinate US Citizens without trial.   He DID create a healthcare system that most can't afford and is falling apart as we speak.  He DID threaten people's kids education if they didn't agree to let transgenders in their bathrooms.  He DID huddle with corporate backers to secretly try to usher in the TPP.  He DID increase the debt to 19.5 Trillion Dollars and spent more money than all other US Presidents...COMBINED.

It IS correct to start a sentence with ""And"" or ""But"" if you do it correctly, which Maggy did. I'll even do you the favor of not asking you to take my word on it. Here, enjoy this copy paste from Get it Wright, a website on grammar rules:  ""Most likely, many people believe they should not start a sentence with a  coordinating conjunction because their grammar teachers in grade school  discouraged them from doing so. Yet such a rule is completely  unjustifiable. When grammar teachers teach youngsters the essentials of  sentence structure, they most likely explain that coordinating  conjunctions are used to hold together elements within a sentence.  Therefore, they may discourage students from starting sentences with  coordinating conjunctions because they are trying not only to explain  conjunctions but also to help their students learn to avoid sentence  fragments like this one:  She was a nice girl. And smart, too.  In this example, using ""and"" after the period is wrong because the  second ""sentence"" is not really a sentence at all: it has neither a  subject nor a verb.   Thus, youngsters carry forward into adulthood the notion that a sentence  should never begin with a coordinating conjunction, especially not with  ""and"" or ""but."" In fact, however, professional writers have started  sentences with coordinating conjunctions throughout history.""",9년 전(수정됨),5,

I'd call it a win.  Not a resounding win, but not a colossal failure either.     Futhermore, the U.S. economy is not an island, it also responds and is subject to the markets and how goods and services move around the world.   The president can influence some of the factors in its growth, using a limited set of tools.  Congress also has a ton of power over how that can unfold too.   It ought to be a team effort.

@Papillon_2010,"srnos, it doesn't matter what your experiences are.  The fact is you are on the internet disparaging the way a woman looks and questioning whether she is a man.  She handles herself with class at all times and is not deserving of your ridiculous, mean comments.  I doubt you were with a Playboy Bunny and if so, so what?  Is that your interpretation of what makes a woman worthy?  Someone who gets paid to walk around half naked with a bunch of other women walking around half naked.  Moreover, this phantom Bunny MUST be a complete idiot to have dated someone who would say the things that you have said and think the way you think.  But again, I doubt it.  If you were really man about the town you wouldn't be on the internet trolling.  Pathetic waste.  I think it's hilarious how you are so defensive about your experience that you felt the need to give us your dating resume.  He doth protest too much, eh?... ha, ha, ha.  Here is my guess:  you live in a basement, probably inbred, minuscule penis (did the Bunny laugh when she saw it?), no friends (besides US on the internet), broke as a joke and angry about all of the above... feel free to comment if you like.

Parents knew their children more than anyone else and the first family/supervision provided them with security. It has been noted the parents themselves  (from these results) may have certain direct neglect to the security, safety and welfare of the concerned individual.

One of the important reasons she lost in 2016 was that James Comey, a Republican, right before the election, re-opened her emails case, which proved to be without substance. Her huge lead melted away because of this sabotage. However, the main reason was the idiocy of tens of millions of right-wing white supremacists and Christian nationalists (aka neo-fascists), who found a false prophet in one of the worst Americans and human beings that has ever walked this earth.",1년 전,0,

The truth is the clintons have been criminals and liers since they have started their political careers, i bet you believe she was under fire in Benghazi. the one thing i have noticed about all of the clinton followers is they too like to lie and mislead and tell have truths. you sound like the rest of the globalist. We have a serous issue with black on white crimes in the U.S.A. and black people killing police officers and killing each other. why not show your queen and her husband going around to the black collages in sighting the black race with racism slurs.  i believe Abraham Lincoln was a republican and most of the slave owners were democrats. all i can say is shame on all you people and especially you people who can influence through television for misleading the american people. it's a sad time for America and what we once stood for.",9년 전,0,

@hansmahr8627,"Yeah, the guy who famously hated leftists and imprisoned and murdered socialists and communists was actually a socialist himself. Who knew. If you morons actually spend some of your free time reading actual books, you might actually learn something. Hitler was not a socialist. No serious historian has ever considered Hitler a socialist. The fact that the word 'socialist' was part of his party's name is about as relevant as the fact that North Korea calls itself a democratic republic.  For people who might read this and who are interested in the topic: the first important point is that the definition of left-wing and right-wing depends on the context. Conservatism in America today and conservatism in early 20th century Germany are very different things. American conservatism is heavily influenced by libertarianism, that's the origin of the whole small-state idea and the strongly capitalist ideology among US conservatives. Outside of the US however, there were and are different types of conservatism. And historically, conservatives were usually defenders of a strong state. A good example would be someone like Bismarck, a well-known conservative hardliner who wanted an extremely strong state and who also was the first politician to introduce public health care and similar welfare programs. It would be utterly idiotic to call him a socialist because of that. He absolutely despised socialists and considered them a huge threat. Which is actually the main reason why he introduced welfare programs, he wanted to cut off public support from socialists.  Strong state conservatism was common in Germany, it still is. In the beginning of the 20th century, there even were conservative movements in Germany who were very critical of capitalism. This is confusing to American conservatives because they only know libertarian conservatism.  Now the Nazis did have a left-leaning wing early on in the 1920s (left-leaning compared to the core of the party, not actually left-wing). Some of the people on the left wing of the party were actually in favor of a light form of socialism. Hitler was not one of them. He fought against the left-wing in his party and pretty much eradicated them. For Hitler, the word socialism in the party name was just a way to gain the support of the workers. German workers in the 1920s overwhelmingly supported the social democrats and the communists, so it was a good idea to make them think that the Nazis were socialist too. It was  effective propaganda.  Just read some of Hitler's speeches. He hated socialists, communists and leftists almost as much as he hated the Jews. He thought leftism was a Jewish conspiracy to destroy the world. Locking up leftists was almost the first thing he did after coming to power. He didn't lock up conservatives and right-wingers, he invited them to join forces with him.  Economically, the Nazis were mostly capitalist. They criticized capitalism at times but that was mostly a part of their antisemitism (Jewish bankers and so on) and remember: right-wing criticism of capitalism was common at the time. Big businesses thrived under the Nazis. Think of huge companies like IG Farben, Mercedes, BMW, Siemens, whatever. They were offered extremely favorable conditions by the Nazis and they made enormous amounts of money. Privatization was at an all-time high during the Third Reich. The Nazis did get involved in the economy, but that was mostly to build their massive war machine. It wasn't a result of some sort of leftist economic ideology, they just wanted to prepare for war.   Basically: read a fucking history book before you spread nonsense on the internet. And stop listening to Republican propaganda.",1년 전,0,

There are two reasons why people like trump in my opinion: 1. The first reason is because, though Trump says very offensive things, those things are not offensive to you and don't affect you and  so you see him as being honest when he's really just being rude and shameless. 2. The other reason is because being Shamed is seen as worse than death in most situations. For example some people would rather kill themselves than have their shameful deeds brought to light. If you accept your shame then you will be crushed by society but if you are shameless you are put on a pedestal. Yes, you will be hated by some but you will be revered by others;those that respect you will ignore all of the negative things you do.

Personally, I don't think Hilary is pefect, but saying she's as bad as Trump is a false equivalency, if she was president, it'd kind of be like if Ted Cruz had been, most likely nothing would change, but it'd be better than starting World War 3.",9년 전(수정됨),0,

And Jill Stein likewise is stealing votes from Hillary if anyone. But she's doing even worse than Gary. I really don't understand why they wanna run, at this point.

@oorrossie,"***** True dat on the golf courses and trump thing, however, is it appropriate for a presidential hopeful to have properties on the scale of Mr Trump's? Surely this will drive his interests in the direction of making choices which will protect his own golf courses, brands etc. as opposed to doing what is truely right for ALL american business and Americans in general? So I'd assume that there's at least a bit of a conflict of interest with his holdings, that's just a defending myself argument though :D.  For the Muslims thing, I would admit that currently the problem is largely in the Muslim community and that there have to be steps taken towards combating radicalization in the Muslim community, for example reaching out to Imams and the Muslim community as a whole to ensure that they can self-monitor the problem and create a more organic solution to this crisis. I do think that Trump's policy in this case would be beyond disastrous though, it creates a self-fulfilling prophecy where non-radicalised Muslims are treated like terrorists by the west to the point where they come to resent the west and in fact drives them to become terrorists (basically what you said :D :D)",9년 전(수정됨),0,

Let's face it, I have no idea what happens in the afterlife, and you don't either, assuming there even is one. But if I have spent my life being charitable, being nice to everyone, having love in my heart and being morally against hurting another human, and avoiding greed throughout, I think I should be able to go to a nice place without worrying if I touched my penis because it felt nice (because let's face it, that's a very human thing to do and I think it should actually be encouraged).",9년 전,1,

Love for me is ""two made as one."" That is why they call Jesus and God the same, because they love each other wholly. Sadness is a lack of knowledge of truth.

@truculentbelly,"+Rad Radkowski it might not have been overt racism but viewing black women as more aggressive, more masculine or 'manly' is one of those beliefs we just grow up with and don't question, similar to how we view black children as older than they are, ie. more mature and less deserving of the allowances we give white children (there's a bunch of studies and essays on both subjects if you're curious!) and, yes, it's based in racism. maybe the commenter didn't mean to be racist but they were. if they didn't mean it: cool, they can look at their own thoughts and beliefs and figure out why they think the way they do and if they wanna keep believing those provably racist things. if they did mean it they deserve to be labbelled the racist they are. either way, i'm gonna call them a racist",9년 전,0,

As has been repeatedly stressed, Mrs Obama is a real woman for real men...Grown men. Men who know what to do with a woman when the opportunity presents - like court them with every bit of their being, marry and forever love and cherish them. And that certainly isn't you. It's rather curious however that she does manage to obsessively command your attention so much that you not only take time to come to You tube to watch videos of her, but to also comment at length - and return again and again wanting to start conversations about her. That's weird and wild. She's not your type and that's ok. But I doubt you'd even marginally appeal to her in any way: physically or intellectually. She's so out of your league - and probably old enough to be your mother even if she looks younger than her 53 years. That you feel the need to tear down this perfectly lovely woman simply because she doesn't fall into your very narrow, plastic surgery-created/artificially enhanced/modified and very warped perception of ""beauty"", not only confirms your juvenile mindset, but pegs you as a very, very small, shallow, narrow-minded, petty, spiteful and very malicious person - Callous with more than a hint of sociopath. Real men - and decent people in general, don't run around maliciously slating women for no reason - and especially a woman who's not on the market - and is clearly very happily married and completely doted on, respected and adored by the same man she's been with for 27 years, and is mother to their 2 teenage daughters - one of whom is college-bound - and probably about your age.

We're not better, we are the same (that, you could say, is being generous). Race relations are better when genocide is literally being called on those of lighter skin tone (this woman, by the way, has publicly advocated it and telling her crowd ""being looked at in the museums as if you are going to do wrong"" doesn't help the tensions, does it?).

Is that the best you could do, really? People have lost trust in him, have you not heard?  How exactly could one be misled when they don't allow others to lead them in the first place? Unlike you, I find no reason to put my trust in this party or the other.  If your president is unable and willing to end the inhumane killing of civilians along with infringement of citizen rights while somehow supporting a nation that leads the world in human rights violations, he has failed. Are you saying you are for war? You're not, are you? Has this president ended it? He has not. You blame his predecessor for starting it, how about you blaming this one for not stopping it.  If the individual you named is the definition of Conspiracy theorist to you, you have much to learn. Ask him about the Charleston church somehow going back to service just a couple days after nine were just supposedly slaughtered, dashcam footage redacted failing to depict video confirming the Newtown Bee picture released during the Sandy Hook event (ask him if he still believes children died that day, which has yet to be proven, let's be honest), call his show and ask him what he thinks about our unwillingness to declare war on the health emergency known as cancer that to this day takes the lives of defenseless children yet we still do not have cure with all the begging for contributions. Did you say this because you listened to his show and hate to admit you have?  I'm far more of a conspiracy theorist than he will ever be without the constant plugging for pseudoscientific products for sale, that's pitiful. His regular inclusion of Church into State by bringing his personal beliefs into public domain is not what skepticism intends. Do you truly believe he is the opposition, he is no sincere Libertarian, is he? You don't think he leans to the right? That's the problem.

@toldiam5841,"Playervid ZeroZeroFour Again, I ask, what steps have we taken forward on those subjects? We've moved forward on climate, really? What has this president done, not said, to combat it? Here's the problem, you fail to see that one party denies it exists and the other denies to act. Deniers don't believe it, that's their issue, what are we doing about it? Nothing, simple. National security we've taken steps forward. In other words, you agree that we've contained ISIS just a day prior to Paris being struck, national security has improved thus why homosexuals are slaughtered in a nightclub (you're all for social justice, are you not, where's your outrage over this? How bizarre is that, gays being killed in a nightclub. That doesn't worry you?).  National security has not ""moved forward,"" how is it moving forward when we're being told Russia is moving toward invading Poland and the like, Iran and North Korea are heading towards perfecting their abilities to strike. Do you believe is safer based on this path, yes or no? National security will not ""move forward"" until we take care of ourselves, and stop policing the world. If you want national security to improve, again, how about you tell your sweet president to bring back the troops he has pledged to command to protect our borders (if we aren't going to secure it), and take executive action already on the gun control measures he believes in already. Why isn't he acting? High schools are being shot up at and what does he do? Shed crocodile tears? International security is on the brink of war, national security is more scattered than molecules in boiling water. Your president doesn't act, he talks, that's his profession.  The subjects you've named I'm all for modernizing, remember I belong to no puppetmaster affiliation. The unforgivable sin in this case, however, is that we have a president who talks but does not walk.  ""It does not mean we should all stand up and blow the guy"" Blow, that could have two definitions. However, why don't we? In this politically correct country of ours in modern day, not one person is even brave enough to blow him, that's not concerning? He blows an entire region up on our globe, blowing up 13 year old boys in Yemen, does he know what it's like to be ""blown?"" If he can't take blowing, that's probably why he never served in the military. You're right, we shouldn't line up against him- he's only the president, after all, such poor puppets they are- we should line up against poor decision-making.  The fact it's improved? Is it a fact? You haven't really told me how exactly it has because I've just named examples of how it has not. Interestingly enough, you listed ""socially"" first as if social issues should be our main concern. Gay marriage is not more important than global warming, or is it? Nonsense, please snap out of it. We already made their unions law around the nation, congratulations, now can we ensure Milwaukee doesn't happen again? How about the recent Tulsa police shooting? Seriously, when are we going to be interested in stopping this? Our country is in terrible shape, you are better than this.  As I've mentioned, nobody trusts him or his squad anymore, why don't you try to discredit Bill Cooper? You probably can't, that's why, he at least seemed to be able to hold himself steady unlike this stooge who has somehow yet to be assassinated.  Nation's improved economically by reducing the deficit, such a historic accomplishment, isn't it? Just because you smack a mole, doesn't mean it another won't pop out of another hole. He smacked the deficit mole, you do realize there is a debt mole, right?  You have yet to answer whether war and foreign entanglements are moral or not, makes one think you're not against these perennial wars your president has ""left to the next president."" Heck, even the Jesus Christ I do not believe in appears to be more moral, at least he at one point spoke of peace. Your president has, sadly, earned the immense disapproval he has gotten. His obligatory, authoritarian Health Insurance Mandates aid Insurance companies more than they do the patients, he has continued to divide families of servicemen and women by not lifting them back to safety, he pushes Partnerships and Deals his own allies and citizens are vehemently against yet does as he personally sees fit without- possibly- even seeking advising for. He's better than this, my friend. As much as I'd like to view him in a positive light, not sure that's possible ever since his ties from the day of his 2008 campaign announcement to the minute he laid hands on checks from corporate banks.
