@mooneyes2k478,"Except that there is no particular proof that the punch(es) had anything to do with it. It's a popular story, and might even be true. But there is no proof of it, and strong suggestions otherwise. Houdini died of peritonitis, in turn secondary to a ruptured appendix. And the cases of actually rupturing an appendix due to blunt force trauma such as that caused by a punch, or even a series of ones, is to say the least rare. Beyond this, the accounts of what actually happened, and how it happened, that day, vary WIDELY...there's even argument about which DAY it was. You claim the 26th...there's other accounts that claim the 22nd. The most likely situation is that, Houdini was already suffering from an inflamed, and subsequently ruptured, appendix, which led to the peritonitis that killed him, but that he discounted this as being discomfort, and potentially pain, lingering from these punches. Since he thought that that was what it was, he wouldn't have thought it was worth going to a doctor for, it would after all pass...and so, he reached a point where it was too late to do anything about it.",10년 전,7,

@mooneyes2k478,"tiancsb Indeed, and I never said it didn't. But in the particular case of Houdini, the cause of death was determined to be, secondary, due to a ruptured appendix. And while it does happen, as you said, the number of cases in medicin in general is low, very low in fact. So, while it IS possible..it is unlikely.

@karizma5521,+SmarterEveryDay I'm pretty sure the whole punch is just a misconception. Houdini was incredibly ambitious and even found it impossible to take vacations. He would endure pain and sickness through shows all through his life. Also the man didn't just assault him. Houdini allowed him to punch him but didn't brace fast enough. He literally worked himself to death and died in a hospital after finally being unable to finish a show. Source: The Man Who Walked Through Walls Houdini by William Lindsey Greshem.,9년 전,1,

Here’s a spoiler but only read on if you want to hear it:     Theory One: Harry Houdini died on October do to a punch in the stomach. It had led to his appendix bursting, and all the toxins went into his body. He eventually died from the toxin poisoning From His Own Body!! Crazy, right? We have stuff that can legit kill us in our own bodies. That’s why you need to be careful and if you ever feel a really bad pain in your appendix you should go to the hospital before it’s too late 👻  Theory two: He had his intestines exploded, and it obviously could have killed him or it could have led to organ damage. Once it would lead to organ damage, especially if it was his kidney(s) failed he could get quite sick and obviously could have killed him. If y’all have any more ideas please tell me!

@newdoconprogress3763,"understanding the words they said: When the doc said we need to tense up the muscles before taking the punch he is specifically referring to the 4 major abdominal muscles which are external oblique, internal oblique, transverse abdominis and Rectus abdominis( which is responsible for the 8 packs).  Now coming to the next thing which is peritonitis, we can consider a balloon in the abdomen and the abdominal organs as small beads. Now if you shake the balloon with the beads in it then the beads would move around and displace from their original position. Now if we consider this scenario with our own body, the result would fatal as the organs would be flying around everywhere even if we do simple movement. So our body adapts to this situation by attaching the organs to the abdomen. The way they attach is complex but in simple terms imagine pushing those beads into the balloon from outside, even though the beads are pushed from the outside they end up inside the balloon but with a layer of the rubber around them. This balloon is called as peritoneum. Occasionally due to trauma blood stars to leak from the abdominal organs. Due to the trauma this balloon might get damaged and the blood would start leaking into the balloon. This pooling of blood is very dangerous because the the blood could get infected and damage the other abdominal organs(also called as viscera). The term ‘itis’ in peritonitis means inflammation, therefore peritonitis translates to inflammation of peritoneum which again is in response to various other factors induced due to the trauma.  Hope this helps😊",5년 전,16,

These serve the use to support your wrist to prevent what happend to Destin. But in most high end martial arts  (especially in Karate or such) one depends on conditioning and Training. (A buddy actually wrote his ""Dan"" Paper about this topic) Training is especially important for the wrist. The more you punch the stronger it gets.

@Nunya_Bidnez,This is not the complete story. He had stomach pain after the issue. The doctors advised him to go the the hospital but he refused until his show was complete. After he went and they found out he had appendicitis and he was treated and put on revolutionary meds at that time. He continued to get treatment but on the train ride to Detroit he felt ill and when he got there had to be hospitalized and eventually succumbed to the fore mentioned medical issue in this video. Much debate surrounds his actual cause of death including a preexisting appendicitis but I guess no one will really ever know the truth. I have done the trick in question many times myself and have taken a few really bad hits that hurt but the few times i was hit by a punch unexpectedly really hurt. I lived to tell the tale in a sore state none the less.,5년 전,0,

@ThomasGabrielsen,"For a fraction of a second that fit man looked fat. :-D  Here comes a little trivia about Houdini about how he manage to ""pick handcuffs"" so fast. At the time he was an active performer there was only a few brands of handcuffs around the world. I don't remember the exact number but it was around five types and every brand had the same key for all the handcuffs. So Houdini could, by having a small set of keys open every type of handcuffs keys that existed in the world at the time. I A was pretty clever thing to do and I never understood how he could ""pick"" the handcuffs so fast before I watched in a documentary. So when he went to a show and the police put the handcuffs on him and he ""picked"" in a few seconds must have been pretty amazing and almost unbelievable to watch, and unbelievable was exactly what it was.  :-)",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@bernieburnalot,"Love your channel, man! The other mistake not mentioned in your front punch was failing to use the first 2 knuckles (index, and 2nd finger) by focussing the attack there, the punch becomes sharper, and therefore, more devastating. Also, the strongest punch is the quickest, and most connected distance between A and B. How your stance and your feet are connected to the ground makes a tremendous difference. If you want to learn the hardest and heaviest punch, practice Oshima Shotokan Karate. I have never seen better and harder punches, which are based on pure science.",6년 전,3,

@dakotascuriouschristian,"The guy who punched Houdini was an amateur boxer. The punch in his stomach really had nothing to do with Houdini’s death. Most scholars on Magic and Houdini recognize that Houdini was already having issues with his appendix. But he wasn’t one to go and seek help. The punch to his stomach only gave him a reason to ignore the underlying issue.   By the time he was convinced to go to the hospital, it had already been some time after the punch. The main reason he went was because he could barely walk anymore, and collapsed after a show.   Now, the book you mentioned makes the claim he was poisoned. The reason being that after the surgery, he was starting to recover quickly. However, that all switched all at once and he died shortly after. So he had made a recovery, but after that recovery from a successful surgery, he all of a sudden turned deathly ill and passed away.   So no, it wasn’t from a punch. The issue had been with his appendix and a punch will not make your appendix burst. At most, the punch just gave him an excuse to not see the doctors as he could rationalize the pain. It was a short time after that that Houdini would collapse after a show, and be taken to the hospital, where he had a successful surgery and he began to recover. Either there was a complication, or as the book you suggested claims, he was poisoned, and that was the ultimate cause of his death.",6년 전,0,

@undeadthe1," @msprincesss115   msprincesss115  I can't believe you typed ""what does it really matter if we want to say words differently"" asked! You  were typing not saying, but you asked a great question, and here are a few answers that matter.  1. If you were taking a course in English language grammar, that arguably incorrect fragmented sentence you would have been wrong.   2. You started that fragment of the sentence with the words ""but what"". Those words usually indicate a question requiring  the use of a question mark, and if that was your intention, you would have gotten that wrong as well.  3. If you were in the situation of applying for a job with a daily work routine of interacting with strangers, hiring staff will  most likely or should interpret your lack of concern for proper use of the English language as signs of illiteracy or  ignorance. They might not care to hire someone who can't convey their thoughts so the rest of the population can  understand it.  4. You could be the cause of lost business for your company just because you don't feel like speaking English the way  intelligent people do. If you can't tell someone what you are doing in a manner they can understand, how could they  expect that you understand what they are telling you? A person needs to know the correct meanings and spelling for  your and you're, their, there and they're, two, to and too, for, fore, and four, and length, width and height   Just as with appearance, first impressions of intelligence matters a lot!",6년 전,1,

He probably knows (although is abdominal muscles are sub-par), but instead of actually giving you the one simple trick (eat leass), he gives you a hundred ""easy tricks, doctors hate him for it!"" that don't do anything at all.   215   Larsey12 Larsey12 2 years ago Hey its my favorite magic owl Hoodini!  142   Deusy Deus Deusy Deus 1 year ago I like that you respected him by putting a rock on his tombstone, I'm glad you realized his Jewish customs.  99   Janowitz Modigliani Janowitz Modigliani 1 year ago (edited) To be honest, hospitals were deathtraps back then. If I were Houdini I'd refuse treatment as well. Luckily for me though, I'm black, so they wouldn't have let me in the hospital to begin with.  822   Dishan Rajendram Dishan Rajendram 1 year ago The punch was a fail u almost broke ur wrist lol  85   Fishi Fishi 1 year ago I hope everyone reading this has a magnificent day!!  418   Danhatman Danhatman 2 years ago HOOODIINNIII",7년 전,0,

@LiranBarsisa,"About 0:30, as I've heard the custom to put a rock on a tombstone is because the soul and the memory of the dead lives forever, as opposed to living creatures like a flower. So a rock ""lives"" the same. Putting something that will die is like dishonoring the dead. But searching on the Internet I saw other reasons for this. One claim that a flower might be beautiful to us in the physical world, but meaningless to the dead, as they fade away.

That doesn't mean that it is appropriate to change the English language! It just gives the appearance that you are either illiterate, ignorant, or lazy, and quite possibly all the above. If you filled out a job application, such as ""I really want to work for ur comp cuz ur ppl are gr8"", you probably wouldn't get the job, and just might wind up living under a rock because you couldn't afford anything better on a burger flipping salary.

@A_Beached_Whale,"MORE Jederation he tried to do an uppercut, but you don’t really upper cut onto a surface perpendicular to the ground. His hand was curving upwards— you can see the impact occur when in the mid-arc of his punch.  When you punch a surface, you don’t want to be hitting it at an angle. That just diverts more force away, and some of that force may be diverted to weaker parts of your body (such as the wrist joints) that can’t handle the force. Rather, you want to hit it perpendicularly, which is why uppercuts land on people’s jaws, not on their abdominals. It’s a perpendicular hit to the jaw, this way.",7년 전,23,

You probably already know this, but the Jewish star is two triangles; one facing and, and the other down. Then, at the part showing the book of Houdini, you can see in the upper(ish) right hand corner, you can see a note saying: ""The Making of Americas First Superhero,"" with two little triangles at the top and bottom.

Im not wiser then i was starting it.  I have only seen 3 videos of this channel. Steve irwin friend, venemous thing and losing air on 25k altitude in chamber. Is he always saying things in titles and not showing more indepth story? It was rushed. All over the place. To short. Not funny with the rock in ear.. Just like to know someones perspective? I found the title truly misleading and made  me very dissapointed after watching. I wanted to learn more. Surgeon only showed he is a cool guy (on film at least but i guess more).. Nothing indepth of his last days.  But the top comments nobody is mentioning this? So im like, oke guy has alot of followers are his titles always misleading or stories rushed short and bad jokes?  Just hope a sub or more regular viewer can help me?  Thx (Ps im really ill so yes i have only bed time. I need surgery. On heavy meds, if not i will certainly die. If i do i may have unbarable pain. And a price i dont want but only know after, so then..  im screwed ... only +-5 weeks if i dont have more emergency happen so i can plan my last wills etc. So pls dont hate on me, for asking this question. I truly dont want to waiste hrs and hrs watching. So thats why. Yes im in bed no i so dont have a life. Thx🙏)",6년 전,2,

@FundieBaptist,"Harry Houdini could escape from prisons, handcuffs, strait jackets, gravetombs.. you name it, but he could not escape from death, though he thought he could still come back his wife stopped waiting after 10 years of lighting a candle on the day he died. There is only 1 Person who defeated death, and that is Jesus Christ. Since Adam only One rose from the dead and it was not harry houdini. Only in Jesus Christ is eternal life, that is the truth. Don't be deceived by magicians and illusionists, they can do alot.. but eventually, they will die and perish like the rest of us. Life is not a game, and it does not end after death. In Jesus Christ is forgiveness of sin and true eternal life, it's not a joke and not a fairytale, not a trick or a play of emotions. He DID rise from the dead, and there were over 500 witnesses of that fact! What no human being ever could do, Jesus Christ did and if we believe in Him, we will share in that Life forever with Him.. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Come today sinners, the consequence of our sin is death, that is the punishment and the ultimate proof we are indeed dust and ashes, we all die! But there is forgiveness and eternal life in only One Man, believe today and receive eternal life I beg you. 2 Corinthians 5:20 Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.

Like a lot  -He could regurgitate anything after swallowing it  -He had a knowledge of almost every lock at the time  -He broke his ankle while trying to get into the Chinese Water Torture Cell once  I could probably list a lot more.",9년 전,0,

@antoniodiavolo," Sania Hardy so you said ""he wasn't killed by a punch he was killed by doing the water trick when he goes into a water tank wile his hands are behind his back i think they were hand coifed or something Like that and he had to stay in there for i think like 10 minutes or soand they couldn't get the key in time so they used an ax to open it and then a couple minutes later he died and they say his spirit comes back"".  Please read all of this. It really isn't that much.       First of all, he WAS killed by a punch. He was hanging out backstage on a couch when a pissed of college student decided to ""test"" if Houdini really could take any punch to the gut. In reality, he was mad at Houdini for debunking the supernatural.       He made it through his entire performance, extremely ill and then sought medical attention after the show ended. His appendix had burst releasing an infection into his body. He rejected all medical treatment and eventually died on Halloween.  He did not drown and his maximum time underwater actually holding his breath (without trickery) was around 3 and a half minutes. And he knew this. He could easily escape from the water torture cell and knew his limits.  Where did you get the information that he drowned?",9년 전,0,

Life expectancy for a wealthy adult hasn't changed that much throughout human history.  In fact, there are many historical figures who actually lead troops into battle into their 70s and 80s (Lysimachus, Antigonus, etc), which indicates superior health/fitness to the vast majority of modern people of the same age, likely due to their active lifestyles. Basically, if you avoided infant mortality and infectious disease, you would die only a couple years younger (average) without modern technology.",5년 전(수정됨),2,

The fatal punch(es) occurred before he could do that, and so the force of the fatal blow went straight to his unprotected organs, causing ruptures that led to infection (remember, the human body is fairly toxic to itself at points, but the organs that deal with those compounds usually keep them contained or expelled as quickly as possible), and that infection and lack of quick action to stop it caused his death.",9년 전,11,

@josehorta6969,He died of appendicitis.  His appendix ruptured during the show the night after he got punch in the abdomen 4times by a young man who wanted to know if he could actually take it. His appendix probably got irritated because of the punches.  Although it was most likely going to give him problems eventually if it got irritated after trauma. It was already sensitive and the punches only accelerated the issue.  ,10년 전,0,
