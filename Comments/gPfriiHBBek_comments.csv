@Nxtrice,"Of course he had to add oil propaganda. Global warming is well understood by the experts, there are zero questions, take your car to a receptionist instead of a mechanic if you don't know what an expert is. The oceans are rapidly acidifying, the forests are burning, the entire climate is in a state of collapse, the earth is literally dying. Only extreme stupidity or extreme uneducation could ever believe the rainforest was planted, it literally took millions of years of evolution to be created. Even the tiniest knowledge of the complexity of that ecosystem would know that as plain as day. A crazy level of ignorance and stupidity ruined a great podcast.",6일 전(수정됨),0,
@rickwrites2612,"1 hr in what really strikes me is just how easy it was to convert an illegal goldminer destroying the environment into a purveyor of ecotourism. It really drives home just how most of the smaller outfits (rather than the big multinationals or narcotraffico cartels) are just victims of global capitalism- desperate men born on the ""wrong"" side of the equator, trying to make a living in the only manner they see available to them. I wonder how many, if given an opportunity, would  prefer to be building eco-friendly lodges, teaching students and tourists about biodiversity, teaching Spanish or Ticuna or Quechua, helping scientists find, count and measure fauna, or  managing foreign labor on ""volunteerism vacations"".... it would be amazing to take the whole dirty industry and replace it with a positive one, something that still paid but that was safer and healthier for everyone involved, a win/win for everyone.     Obviously dealing with the multinational corporations and narcotriffico cartels wpuld be much harder and a whole nother ball game (though its interesting how once in the Amazon there is little difference between the two: they both employ private paramilitary mercenaries.)",8일 전,0,

@kindness-love-illumination,"Cosmicomics by Italo Calvino explores this concept of different worlds, people, separated insurmountably by the void of time. Sending out signs and messages that get read and responded to out of sync, so the connection is always out of reach. It’s a beautiful depiction of the longing and the ache of being disconnected from this larger family. People that might know you, but can’t, because you’re too far away. Too far in space and time, but also in understanding.   He has a similar story in that compilation where two beings are falling eternally through space, and their paths never intersect. And somehow they hold on to this hope that someday their paths might cross, that maybe the science could bend to their desire to connect.   A lot of us are trying to live with love, connection, compassion at the core of our values that we carry with us. And sometimes that’s enough - to fulfill whatever purpose we have in this life, or to transcend whatever limitations we’re meant to transcend, or whatever else enough might mean. But there is always a longing, to be connected in a way this world isn’t ready for yet. Maybe that we still aren’t ready for, even though we’d like to be.   🙏🪷💫🌠",1개월 전(수정됨),0,

@cyrus05w," @matthewgenovese8988  just chewing over your comment and I remember maybe a reference to this of what you question. Let's take beavers for example, beavers are natural creatures found in the wild which have no extreme tools but maybe minor and insignificant tools that we wouldn't even consider such. It itself though can destroy the biosphere around it by misplacing one of its dams or not knowing what the next season would bring and having one of his damns block up a outlet. Wow this was explained to me by someone I believe the reference is a stick stuck in the river will find its way out over time but I stick stuck in the sand may stay there much longer. We as a species play stuff into areas in which they do not exist friar, a good example of this would be the banana peel it seems natural but placed in the tri-state area it will not biodegrade as it would if it placed into its natural zone there are no bugs there are no critters there is no wildlife that has any interest in a banana peel if this also helps. I believe though that fever ordeal would be a good example it does natural things but causes unnatural things to occur, there was a point in time where humans were more in tune in nature but because of coalescent theory I believe we're finding ourselves farther and farther away from this.",2년 전,3,

@terryvaughn5066,"I'm 67 yrs old. Born and raised in rural N.E. Alabama,USA. I've witnessed private land clear-cutting timberland (all species) of scopes from 500-2500 acres bordering my property at one time. Seen the once forest floors poisoned to kill natural seeds from regrowing so one species of tree (hybrid paper making pines) can be planted and farmed for a (20-30yr tree crop). I've not seen the forest's wildlife population return back with all the plants, insects, reptiles, amphibians, avians, mammals, all of the varieties it once had. The only good that I received was escaping critters ( mostly insects, birds, frogs, lizards, snakes, and turtles), types that I'd never seen existing here. However, many of them over populated my property. And after a couple yrs they must've died out ( didn't see them anymore). And the common critters seem to be smaller in size now (deer certainly are), turkey almost disappeared. It affects everything. In their world it has to be like an apocalypse. Ppl wouldn't believe the frog/lizard/ and snake cannibalism I observed in the following  yr. Therefore, I hope by being left alone, my natural forested property can be somewhat of a small sanctuary to those critters that remain in my lifetime. I don't foresee tree farming ever diminishing. Please preserve natural forestland, worldwide. 🕊️✌️🇺🇸",4개월 전,0,

Like a tiger on its own will starve without deer pig rabbit ex.ex.   then how much life you need to support the life that feeds the tiger.    Basically that no one species can stand on its own.   That we are all a super organism.    So what affects one affects all.  Same with space travel how much of the life on this planet do we need to take with us to be able to live,9개월 전,1,

@crebbsjd,"I hope these guys read my post. We truly need to bring back and re populate all of the old growth forests, rain forests, rivers, and  jungles. Let's all work together and really get serious about re building all these wonderful places in our world. It should be a worldwide effort to restore these magical places on our only planet. Sadly, I don't think all the important and wealthy people of the world would try or could fix all this. We could create a whole new system of networking, jobs, and a serious plan to restore all this. We should be living in a place of wonder. Full of giant trees with clean water. Not one tree should be cut down. We need to superpower grow giant old growth trees in a fraction of the time. With science, it could be possible. Hemp should replace all use of trees in the world mandatory.  Right now. Stop cutting trees. Hemp for buildings materials,  cloths, paper, whatever materials we need. Hemp can replace it. Please don't let our world dry up and burn down and go away. It should be inside all of us and our duty to work to fix all of the destruction we have caused. Imagine driving, walking, or just being in a giant forest on the east coast of the United States. With giant 300ft tall 35 ft plus in diameter trees. We had that. This planet was a magical place thousands of years ago. Guys like these should be the leaders in getting a huge project to restore this planet. If they had entirely new jobs to fix these issues and restore our planet, I would do that job for sure. Repopulate our animals. Clean up the entire planet. We should all be eating from giant community gardens full of fresh food. The list just keeps going on and on. We need to own this. We can do anything we put our minds to.",11개월 전(수정됨),0,

@rebeccamcelwee3514,"I came across this video by accident you could say.  I had been listening to something else on YouTube and gotten busy. What I was listening to went off, and I was working in a long silence with the ear pod in. I didn’t have time to find something new. I’d find something later.  So thinking my phone went back into screen mode and locked… I just kept working. All of a sudden this video starts playing. It kind of jilted me…lol…  So I didn’t check it… I just let it play.  Hearing the most beautiful and heartbreaking stories. I really do love trees, especially the ones you don’t get to see everyday. I listen through out the rest of my work day… in the car in the way home… and tossed onto my tv when I got home to finish it up.  I will listen to the second one today. I went back over this video trying to see if there was a picture of the pet ant. I was only listening most of the time so if there were a picture I missed it… I’ll keep combing the video to try and find it. The whole idea of carring an ant on your back and saying it was the size of a dog. You jumped on an anaconda?😳 totally freaks me out and astonishes me. I wonder if you’d do it again. However… I think… is this how we were suppose to live our lives.. one with nature. Climb trees all day and play with the animals while playing hide and seek … only… if you’re tagged… you may end up being dinner instead of having dinner.  You drink fresh water right out of the river.  Yet I have no desire to go piranha fishing. You might push me in😂🤣😳😳😳😁🤪 Just how majestic it all sounds. I really am overjoyed that I now know who you are and I’m glad the video played in its own and chose to play when it did. For I may have never found it or made the decision to watch/listen.

What we should be focusing on is the overwhelming amount of evidence pointing towards a changing climate - and taking countervailing action.

Also my Aunt's husband, a foreigner, he worked in the jungle. Now he told a story of how he met snake so big it was too heavy to hunt, it had moss grow on it and camouflaged it into a tree. It just opened its head to eat herbivores that tried to shelter in the ""tree hole."" The jungle he worked was in Borneo, Indonesia.

Jordan Peterson is a huge ego, please watch his interview with Robert Sapolsky to see how bad of a listener he is. He's the last person to give an accurate comment on global warming. So, the comments on climate change is a no go. The way that we're destroying earth and the role of fossil fuel giants instead of vegan boys is what needs to be talked about.

The first i touched a snake i found near a swamp near the temple i was practicing at, didnt remember why i touched it maybe trying to get it to move away from the front gate.  I suddenly felt the disgust feeling similar to what insect gives you and so pulled or picked up this leave so that i didnt have to touch the snake directly, it was a python. I remember the leave was vivid green, as i tried to pick up this snake with a pinching motion, with middle and index finger and the thumb to support, the snake realized i touched it and it started to move away. Its really dumb what i did, coz i dont know there the head was, coz it was kinda coverd altho nothi g happened. I was shocked after touchjng it for maybe .5 seconds. The sheer strenght it has while its just calmly moving away. I imagined it to be softer, but its super hard when it contracts its muscle to move away. Used to think about how people dont just punch their way out of getting eaten alive, i understood right then. Its probably like you girlfriend holding up her guard and trying to fight you. Once you have gripped whatever part of her, maybe you do nt have her under control judt yet, buf that arm or leg is yours. She can punch and hammer fist you all she want but you arent taking damage. Thats the level of leverage it has. Mere miliseconds my hands were in contect with it and trying to pinch and pull, it just moved and i lost the grip immedialy no push pull, it was just gone.",1년 전,0,

@looniper3551,"He is not credible. He is talking about 25-30 foot stankes like that's normal, and 30 foot females being fierce apex predators that rule a lake.. and jumping on one so big his arms wouldn't reach around it.  The World Record snake was 38 feet long, and died for the same reasons almost no snakes get near that size, or even 20 foot in length....  Snakes move by alternating betwee increasing friction with the ground and pushing off of the rest of the ribs which are doing so. Basically they are creating points to push off of, and the portion that pushes in this moment becomes the portion that is pessing down to create a friction point to push from in the next moment... over and over ... rapidly. So the snake ""slined"" from there to here.  The system works great with low mass animals, but as you start approaching a typical snake proportion in terms of 15 feet, it starts to ... break down. The bigger the snake gets beyond typical proportions at around 20 feet... the less effective it is at movement.  A 15 foot snake is burning more than 5 times the energy to move, of one just 10 feet long... and the reduction in efficiency increses disproportionately more than the mass of the snake.  A 35 foot snake can barely function, and typically is only alive because someone is feeding it manually. The One thing he gets right... they shit on you when you try to grab them.   ... Also, just because they go to a location where they will wait (in ambush) for prey, does not mean they aren't actually Ambush Predators. That's actually how ambush predators work.",1년 전,2,

@DeepMindfulThinking,"I want to start out by saying that this was overall an incredible interview, and Paul seems to be as genuine as they possibly come and has experienced things the average person can only dream of. I have the utmost respect. One thing that disappointed me is his continuing the narrative that one needs a shaman to experience Ayuaska ""properly."" Let me tell you guys something....NN-DMT or the main active ingredient found in ayahuasca and it is meant for every single person on this planet to experience. It is a molecule that dates back further than we can even fathom. If you don't get a chance in your lifetime to know even a short smoked or vaped NN-DMT experience, you have probably missed out but that's ok, there is always next life ❤. Now, I will admit, it's not for every individuals  peronality type...People obviously have different encounters and experiences, but even the people whom have these ""bad trips"" know that when they come back, they are altered. Ayahuasca does in fact a lot of times include other alkaloids and can ""hit"" a bit different, but let's just describe ayahuasca as an extended orally induced NN-DMT trip which is activated and moves past your bbb(blood brain barrier) because of the MAOI that is introduced into the drink or tea. I do enjoy Ayahuasca because it seems to ease you into the ""space"" or ""realm"" a bit more and gives you the opportunity to explore this unknown, ""impossible"" space. It is quite the experience and I recommend you try it if you are at all interested in the molecule. You DO NOT need a shaman to have a ""proper"" NN-DMT experience, but just someone you fully trust to watch over you and also give yourself a grounding point. I use music for this, for me, familiar music i thoroughly enjoy works best. I advise you do a 15-20 min venture using traditional NN-DMT crystals by means of smoking or vaping(I find vaping for me gives me a more ""pure experience""). One thing I will mark as important is make sure your NN-DMT is from a reliable source and if you can find the clear white crystal form...Even better. Yellow is ok, but for me, a bit more foggy I think is the wording I'd use? Also like to mention smoking vs vaping is slightly a different feeling. I believe when you use a flame, you are not getting just the NN-DMT, but other alkaloids as well. So, if you're interested, crawl before you walk and walk before you run...Try a typical trip before you dive into the space for hours. You may not want to or need to be here for hours. 15 mins may be all you personally need. Use a trusted family member or friend that you trust with your life. Eventually, if said friend is also interested, you guys can explore this very real realm together....I'll save that for another time. I'm also not going to go into the God molecule here(5MEO), but same idea. Family or friend you trust with your life may be better than a shaman in these spiritual experiences. I'm sorry to ramble but if you have a real opportunity to have the NN-DMt experience and you have proper conditions, don't hesitate because you think a shaman is the only being that can help you discover this previously unknown world. One last thing, while 5MEO is absolutely a different experience, I recommend ""easing in"" with a short NN-DMT experience first, then maybe explore that realm a while using ayahuasca if you have access. From there, if you feel like there is more out there you need to discover like myself.

@KOLOHE_AUMAKUAKamohoalii,"I loved every moment of this interview bc like Paul finding his sacred place among nature and animals, as a Native Hawaiian I have had a lifelong profound love of nature and all animals and the ocean, and I'd prefer to live among the wild animals and sea creatures than with humans.  My heart burst with joy  when Paul spoke at 2:30 about ""that book"" by Kurt Vonnegut Jr. which opens with the first line: "" “Everyone now knows how to find the meaning of life within himself.”  and I was imagining ""that book"" throughout his entire interview.   Paul refers to the ""Harmoniums"" stuck to the walls in a cave on the moon Titan of Saturn. The Harmoniums are like Sea Cucumber slugs, and awaken as pulsating iridescent glowing lights, when one of the space travelers plays music. I imagined Ennio Morricone's The Mission. Originally written in 1959 the space traveler is a millionaire that builds a rocket ship. Eerily familiar?  Just like when the lightning bugs were thick and dense in meadows in Midwestern summers  in the 70s, but how those supernatural magical insects completely disappeared in the 80s 90s from heavy use of pesticides and insecticides, herbicides(glyphosates/Round Up) made by Monsanto now owned by Bayer.  The Harmoniums Paul talks about...are dormant living organisms that come alive to the sound of music played in a cave on an alien planet.  While lying on the dock one hot summer on a lake in Columbia Missouri, I found this forgotten worn .55 cent lavender paperback c.1973 THE SIRENS OF TITAN by Kurt Vonnegut Jr.  Couldn't put it down, and when I got to the part of the cave dwelling Harmoniums I nodded off...woke up hot and dove into the water opened my eyes under water... and lo and behold...in the center of the this little lake in the Ozarks...there were millions of golfball sized white fresh water jellyfish.  It was as if in my dreams I'd manifested Harmoniums.  I wanna go on the Amazon trip with Lex & Paul..!!! 🌺🦋",1년 전,0,

@cagelavey,"I’m sorry brother, but to think that because you had an experience in the jungle that you then can only do ayahuasca in the jungle, is a shortcut to thinking. Also, because your experience took you on your own personal journey, that doesn’t mean that same experience will be produced by another. In addition, if you get some really good mushrooms and eat a hero’s dose (5.5g) you will definitely experience more than you can fathom. I myself, on lsd have seen the whole universe be born then grow and expand past what we presently know and all the universes secrets have on many occasion then opened up to me. On mushrooms I have seen and communicated with source (god for the lack of a better word), I have gained a perspective and understanding into quantum physics in a way to where my experiences gave me knowledge that I previously had never learned nor had ever known. I’ve seen a great many things and have even shared visions with others without muttering one word to one another. I have lost all physical form and have lived an entire life that spanned a great many years in a mere moment while on dmt. Many times on many different substances I have been transformed in a way that made “real” life seem like the illusion. There is more to life than what we perceive, and these gifts, these “hallucinogens,”(a word I can’t stand, fore it is way more than seeing something that isn’t there), they can help you see beyond any measure of what you think you know and you will grow from it. No matter if the experience is perceivably negative or overwhelmingly positive, it will always be what you need in that moment. Understand that and you will find out things about yourself that will help you in life. it’s more like seeing what is always there for the first time, and understanding we are part of something so much larger and more profound than anyone can even imagine. My point, try not to project your experiences onto others. Please don’t make people feel like without sharing the same conditions that you endured that their experiences aren’t as important or aren’t on the same level as to what you went through. Each persons journey is individual to that person. Lex has the right idea, run headlong mind, body, and spirit into the unknown and shed your limitations, come out on the other side where limitation is a long dead idea, and find the beauty of life that awaits you. Responsibly and safely  I believe in a long, prolonged derangement of the senses to obtain the unknown.

I'm sitting here on an island watching a gringo-tarzan talk about madre de dios and feeling the most inspired since i saw my first flacon 9 landing vid.

And even the water that flows throughout our different kinds of bodily fluids that bring us to life and keep us alive have electricity flowing through them to keep our bodies, our avatars, our machines, breathing, thinking, pulsating with life. Jesus is truly before all things, and by Him all things hold together. And it is reflected in His fallen creation.

@brececlark4076,"Paul masterfully conveys the beauty of storytelling, nature, and experience, making the first 2/3 of the interview outstanding. However, the last 1/3 introduces confusion as he acknowledges 70% biodiversity loss in the last 50yrs but agrees with Jordan Peterson that we’re all alarmists. Isn’t that pretty alarming?? He describes in detail the horrors of logging, mining and poaching but questions if we should slow industrial progress literally in the face of everything he just claimed devotion to. He also describes the complexity of emotion, intelligence and consciousness of elephants going insofar to say they need their own legal representation, but then scoffs at the idea of veganism and protecting animals where we can. So what, if a tribe in the Amazon munches on monkey skulls, why would that be an argument for the rest of the world? Lastly, Paul says he only cares about protecting the rainforest but simultaneously praises industrial animal agriculture yet literally 80% of rainforest loss is due to beef production. So, while Paul's mind is impressive, a notable disconnection from human ethical responsibility in the modern era surfaces. He could stand to have a conversation with Damien Mander who founded the International Anti-Poaching Foundation and is a vegan.",1년 전,0,

@realityreconsidered9416,Parallel realities are a real thing! Some of the races visiting us are here to get viable human DNA. Others are only here to help by intervening in most nuclear weapons usage.,1년 전,0,
@realityreconsidered9416,"Robert Hastings wrote a book called, “UFOs and nukes;  reality of UFO incursions at American nuclear weapons facilities has been convincingly established. Hundreds of U.S. military veterans now openly discuss these ominous incidents and thousands of declassified government documents substantiate their revelations.Over the past four decades, renowned researcher Robert Hastings has interviewed more than 150 of those veterans regarding their involvement in these astounding cases. On September 27, 2010, CNN live-streamed his UFOs and Nukes press conference in Washington D.C. during which former U.S. Air Force officers described numerous nuclear missiles mysteriously malfunctioning moments after a disc-shaped craft was observed hovering near their underground launch silos.That shocking episode, in March 1967, was merely the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Documented UFO activity occurred at a plutonium processing plant in Washington State as early as January 1945, months prior to the atomic bombings in Japan. Another incident, in October 2010, involved one missile base in Wyoming being unable to communicate with several of its missile launch control capsules just as a huge cigar-shaped craft slowly flew over them.Significantly, documents smuggled out of Russia in the 1990s confirm that Soviet nukes were also the focus of UFO interest during the Cold War era. On one occasion, in October 1982, a number of missiles temporarily activated for launch, as terrified officers attempted to disrupt the unauthorized count-down. After 15 seconds, the anomaly terminated and the equipment returned to standby status. While this was taking place, an enormous disc silently hovered over the base.In short, the evidence presented in UFOs & Nukes makes clear that humans’ deadliest weapons have been, since their development and use during World War II, under intense scrutiny by still-unidentified observers possessing tremendously advanced technology.Given these disclosures, it seems evident that the UFO-Nukes Connection is highly significant and perhaps even the key reason these mysterious aerial craft have appeared in our skies over the past seven decades",1년 전,0,

After watching a couple of his podcasts I am more and more getting the feeling his whole story is made up and he is just an instagram posterboy con-artist, put in place by the big western agriculture industry. Or please explain, why he is ignoring at any cost the most import fact of the whole story: That (western) meat and dairy consumption are UNDOUBTEDLY and BY FAR!!! the BIGGEST drivers of rainforest destruction in the Amazon. It takes 2 minutes on google to find out, that 80% of the destruction of the Amazon is caused by cattle ranching and around 10% by soy (of which around 75% percent is used as animal feed for the meat and dairy industry). So almost 90%!!!! of the deforestation is caused by meat and dairy consumption! But you keep distracting your audience by talking about those crazy vegans complaining about the fish you catch … and the soy they eat.

@vanjahruska5661,"The machines are designed speciffically and scientifically to make you addicted to playing the game. Your money is turned into credits to make you forget thats real cash you're playing with. Its easier to make a decision to risk it all when all you're betting are just numbers on a screen or in live play chips, never real cash. The lights and sounds of the slot machines are designed to trigger pleasure centers in your brain to make you feel good...even when you just lost your entire paycheck, you feel good. Until you leave the casino, take a breath of fresh air and realize what you've just done. Then the shame kicks in. Then the regret kicks in. It was all made possible because the machines brainwashed you. They tempt you with the prospect of winning a few bucks but once you start playing the stranglehold has started to take place. If you lose your money which you probably will you naturally want to get your money back. Because you regret losing it. And you decide to get it back by playing some more. Thats when youre screwed. And if you win thats when youre screwed even more. Because if you win, sooner or later you will decide to play again because you won last time. You are generally up, you can afford to potencially lose x-amount of money. The reasoning begins. Because you are brainwashed. You just want to play because you think colors are preety and the sound sounds good. In reality the more the play the more you are going to lose, statistically, mathematically, realistically. The slot machine seems like a place of victory and relaxation but its actually a place of loss and despair. You have no chance of winning, it is mathematically totally unsound for you as a player, a gambler. The slot machine is a siren, it will shipwreck you. For anyone who is reading this and has a gambling problem right now please realize that the machine is brainwashing you. It has all the psyhological edges on you that you aren't even aware exist. You have no chance of resisting its addictive power. All you can do is force yourself to leave the casino or wherever you are at. If you are gambling in real life in a casino you have it good. Just dont physically go there and you're all clear. The internet gambling is the real problem. I know hard it can be to stay away from gambling when the casino is in your pocket. If you cant stop depositing the best thing you can do is get yourself banned. Restrict your access it comes down to that. Thats our only chance. When you play the machine is charge. You are making unreasonable decisions. You have been brainwashed, remember that. Screw them. They don't deserve our money. Good luck to everyone  strugling with a gambling addiction.",1년 전,0,

Ephesians 4  What does “he ascended” mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions[c]? 10 He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe. 11 So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, 12 to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up 13 until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.  Research The Shrud Of Turin proof of The Living and resurrected Christ, Let those who have eyes to see and ears to hear discern the eternal truth of Christ!!! Give no room to false doctrines of devils and satanic belief systems DO NOT BE FOOLED by WARLOCKS AND WITCHES !!!! Praise The Living Christ pray to download the Holy Spirit of YAHWEH, to accept and cleansed by the blood and covering of Christ, and to become one with The Heavenly Father : YAHWEH  EL ELYON ELOHIM  EL SHADDAI  with Holy Ghost Baptism, seek deliverance renounce the kingdom of Satan and repent from all known and generational sin!!!! In the name of YESHUA HAMASHIACH ADONAI , THE HOLY ETERNAL CHRIST    The Anointed One!!!  Jesus Christ was mentioned in Bhavishya Puran. He was mentioned as Isha Putra- Son of Ishwar/God. He is also mentioned as the Archarya of Mleechas. Rigveda, the first scripture, also presents Christ without mentioning His name, but referring to Him as the Word who is God.

Thank you Alex and Paul. 🙏  — However, I couldn’t help but find it hard to comprehend how neither of you referenced God our creator and Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. To me it’s so clear that this earth, while so beautiful and miraculous, is a temporary home. And God, Jesus, the writers of the scriptures, the saints all make it beyond clear that there is real evil present and living amounts us and a real spiritual dimension that awaits us after this is all over.  While we certainly must steward the world we live in, and it glorifies God to give His creation such awe and appreciation, but He wants us to be saved and live with Him forever in eternity- and our spiritual salvation should be a daily dedication and commitment.

Literally cutting down the lungs of the Earth. It’s actually something that everyone of us on this planet should be doing whatever is possible to protect this place as it benefits us all. And we should all be the stewards of this planet we share. We should be protecting the animal species that are being poached into extinction. I don’t want to believe it’s even possible for tigers to be slaughtered into extinction in my lifetime. And many other species as well.

@Scottharrison-m9g,"There is a reason that Jordan Peterson doesn't focus on other minds, it is that his research framework and counselling framework is more an extension of, more or less, Jungian psychology and focuses on sort of mythological archetypes and personality, plus his own personal theological biases add to the mix. He isn't a cognitive scientist, he doesn't come from the cognitive perspective, which views intelligence and even consciousness as a, literally, computational process and as non unique to human beings or even living things. That hasn't stopped Jordan Peterson from described himself as a ""neuroscientist"" and as an ""evolutionary biologist"" at various times, seemingly he is aware that his actual paradigm doesn't make him qualified to talk generally about these subjects and he really badly wants to be seen as a general scientific thinker. He is a personality psychologist and former counselling psychologist who wrote some self-help books. He existed for decades without any outside interest, it was only once he started making videos against the inclusion of gender identity under Canadian hate crime laws that his popularity soared, this tied in with the rise of the new right and its backlash against the SJW movement (see Gamergate). He is an inherently reactionary figure (he is nicely employed at the Daily Wire after all). I don't understand how people put him in a similar camp as the like of Sam Harris and even scientists from more hard science perspectives. He is Dr. Phil for young men on the new right, and is just not a very interesting or unique thinker, he is also very thin skinned and has a martyr complex, making him an inherently unpleasant person.",1년 전,0,

Between stupid posts and reels this was a mind refreshing experience from a person much more experienced in life as is anyone, not about money, not about fame (even tho he still needs it to presue hes goal) but giving me the real things he’s been trough. Much love for your mission and I can assure you that you motivated alot of people to take nature more seriously and be aware of where are we brough from. We are nature with a egoistic intelect and you nailed that topic without insulting anyone. There are people who follow their dreams and are blessing to whole world, and you sir, are deffenetly one",2년 전,4,

@nxsmotorsports,"The more I learn about Mr. Fridman and his outlook on life, the more I admire and respect this fellow human. He has such reverence and genuine appreciation when he interacts with others.  I haven't seen all the episodes of this podcast, but perhaps someone can tell me about a particular interview or clip that answers this question:  Is Lex living through a great loss or the death of loved ones? His heavy sighs and taking time to formulate his responses before speaking, as well as his reoccurring curiosity regarding mortality, death, love, and the meaning of life, make me wonder to what degree, if any, he is experiencing grief and the loss of those he loves.  I could be totally wrong, but he's so appreciative and grateful for every guest's time and perspective. He seems very humble and full of gratitude, and my intuition tells me that he has possibly experienced a deep trauma or great loss.  I wouldn't ""enjoy"" hearing that he has deeply suffered. I hope that I'm wrong, but if he has shared any insight into his personal life regarding these matters, I believe it would help me understand him more as a person and very likely become an inspiration in hopes that I can help others and myself who are living through something similar.  If he has not publicly discussed this topic, I fully understand and respect his privacy.  Much love to anyone reading this. May your day be filled with growth, gratitude, and love. I hope your future is filled with the kindest of moments and the fondest of memories. 🖤",2년 전,0,

And when I woke up for days later turns out I was in a pressure control room people were in biohazard suits they told me my fever got up to 107 I was in a coma for three days all because of that MRSA superbug staph infection it almost killed me and when I saw it in this interview just kind of brought back all those memories and the pain I felt in my hand and how horrible I felt and how scared I was when the hospital said they're going to amputate my arm.

Studio musicians have to distance themselves because the music industry tries to pull them in and constantly seduce them to be part of a band but if they sign a contract they get peanuts.I hope the writers win out with the strike.",2년 전,0,

@robertwalsh4408,"That was incredible.. brilliant to watch and forgetting lex and his emotional attachment with Ukraine which I have a totally different view of the history of the conflict with Russia as being an Irish Republican and knowing without Irish rebels and having to stand up to the British empire for freedom and the love I have for the people who gave up there lives for a love for there group there culture there truth as they see it.  I don't like how Ukraine has been told by the west that the west cares about Ukraine and to know these politicians don't care about there own families sometimes and money drives them sickens me, to think that Ukraine publicly are told they can become apart of Europe when I know privately they are told you will never be apart of Europe and they still think America and Europe will give hope to Ukrainen nazi's that we're on your side blows my mind and some Ukrainen people actually believe that the west gives a shit about the people of Ukraine,  to them the more civilians that are killed is a propaganda victory to the people who are running this war and lex being someone I believe in and understand he's a human and if it gives him hope that Ukraine will not be forgotten by the British and American politicians when they leave others who have helped and America has packed up and left the people like in Afghanistan to there future as the Taliban take back the country when they were told we will never leave you to be oppressed again and the people who are 20 years old and have grown up believing American military industry won't leave them to be killed for helping the American military complex make money and the opposite happens why does the people in Ukraine believe that they are different this time.. I don't understand why they trust the American military and European military actually give a shit about them as a people, I don't understand why they believe that the west will  this time it will be different. If or When Russia destroys Ukraine as if they really want to it would take weeks but Russia understands that the Ukrainen people are cannon fodder to make the Russian military weaker and that's really the goal for these filth of the earth to use people's hopes..  and they'll leave Ukraine to its fate if this isn't a win situation for America and Europe.. I'm Irish and understand conflict as I grew up with the IRA blowing up every thing in the north of Ireland to make it ungovernable,  this went on for 30 years some days up to 20 British soldiers being blown away by people I supported because they were killing children who were native Irish people who are caught on the wrong side of a border.. the British army come in and kill people who started out just wanting civil rights.  That's what we call bloody Sunday. Children a priest women and men who had stones as weapons against the power of the British army.  They just opened up and killed these civil rights activists.. but other than that I on a  human level really admire lex because I love the way he's trying to understand everything and still has love for people and there hopes,  a brilliant man with a brilliant mind and tries to understand others points of views as I see myself in him. Trying to unravel emotions from truth and facts and that is what it is to be human.  I love listening to him and the questions he asks. I love to try figure out everything from space to religion to war to the environment and what we as a species are doing to this planet.  Are we an experiment created by the universe to see how we behave towards each other.  Like is-ra-al and the way they treat the Palestinians who have been on that land for thousands of years and it has always been called Palestine from Greek times 5000 years ago , there was never a country called is-ra-al yes as a people who had the same culture but had 12 different states in what they would call is-ra-al as they had twelve tribes.. God disowned them and told them to leave the land of Palestine as they were not keeping their contract with God and were wicked and he in the bible says go and don't come back on till you understand I'm the God who tried to keep you as a people who are holy and good people but they kept praying to other gods and the creator said I've had enough I banish you from this land I chose for you to live love and be the people who I want to be the the best I could create.. but they went to war with each other.  Would tape women and young girls and boys,  judges 22 to 24 in the bible is a story that explains what I'm trying to say in words. They did horrible things to outsiders.. look at the west bank and Palestinians at this moment there murdering Palestinians and taking the land and if the Palestinian people try and fight back there terrorists,  what do people expect them to do just lie on the ground and let bulldozers roll over them and their homes.  That's actually happening today but some try fight back with guns and come up against one of the world's biggest army's and technology companies way ahead of a rifle they have drones that can fly into Palestinians homes and are so small they can land there drones in parts of homes and the people don't even recognize there's a bomb drone in there home and it just takes a button to press and the family are all wiped out.  That's so evil I understand God himself told the Hebrews to leave the land don't come back but after ww2 they did brought genocide to the Palestinian people and today are killing and stealing the last piece of land that Palestinians have left to raise a family have children and be happy just to have life.  To me that's so so wrong it makes me cry honestly I feel for a people who are just terrorists by the is-ra-ali people.  They kill women who are pregnant and say we'll kill two snakes with one bullet.  How hateful do you have to be to see other humans as like shooting fish in a pond. It's that mindset that makes this world ugly.. and it's all about the greater Israeli project... Google that part.  The greater Israeli project plese and you'll understand Zionism and what zionists are.  There basically like the nazi ideology.  We're the master race and everyone else are subhuman.. just filth to be exterminated.  Look up zionists and what that means,  Mossad go around the world and murder Iranian scientists just to keep them back from progressing for their country.  There terrorists as well if they fight back against their better weaponry... Lebanon there terrorists as well,  the Syrian government are terrorists as well as seen yesterday were Mossad planted a car bomb that killed many Shia muslims,  they helped beat ISIS and ISIS terrorists get hospital treatment in is-ra-ali hospitals.  Google that as well.  Find the truth.  Don't live in a fantasy..",2년 전,0,

@jukee67,"This guy should come to Kensington, Philadelphia, Pa...I would love hear him tell his story after visiting an alien planet environment mixed with what Hollywood turned into a hit cable television show.  I am certain he will see things he never knew existed.  He might return speechless and eventually weeping uncontrollably.  Worst case scenario he picks up a few Big Pharma sponsors so they can spend more of those endless profits on pushing the next wonder drug with the list of side effects leading a majority of the time available when constructing another commercial.  The Marlboro Man got cancelled for much less.  Philly is the city of brotherly love, just remember to bring a bulletproof vest and some Narcan if you wanna get a little of the sponsor money by the company that advertise that particular drug outside of the sneeky pitch repeated by our wonder media I just wish I could find one good thing to say about since thst day in Dallas and that single bullet did the impossible.  Can we get more background on this guys family...assets, ties to anyone or anything that might be considered privileged...not trying to put him down.  Just need context.  He grabs a hold of the audience from reading thru the comments.  Kensington is in a level of a Welcome to the jungle topic.

@1minutereview-s,"I feel sad for humanity. Poor deluded human beings being led like sheep to the slaughter. It reminds me of that cartoon picture of a woman holding an umbrella open in her living room staring at a TV screen because the weather man is stating it’s raining, she has her rain coat on ready to go out but looking out of her window to her side it’s a sunny bright blue sky day. 😢  We are so stupid. We are here for a moment, a moment in earths history that if you compressed earths age down to one million years old we have lived here a fraction of a second yet we are led to believe that it’s us creating the GW or whatever it’s called today. But nobody ever stops to think hang on, isn’t the earth and universe still evolving? Aren’t we still in perpetual motion flying through space like a corkscrew along with our sun? Why would any sane person believe nothing will change? Change naturally that is, why must we find an answer we can understand, why do we have to blame others for the planets natural problems and most importantly why are certain groups cunningly finding ways they can blame us so they can tax us for something that is completely normal. As I say, we believe what so called scientists tell us we are doing to the planet which I personally think is an agenda, a narrative that must be followed. The issue is that because global warming is real nobody questions it, the proof is there but I’m telling you it is not us, it’s simply a natural cycle, and we must stop blaming ourselves for it for profit.  I just think a special group of people realised what was happening, saw an opportunity and rolled with it. And here we are, staring at the weather man.",2년 전,0,

@LadyBug1967,"Thank you Alex for having on this guest.  HE'S just amazing with his stories and his lack of fear shall we say in the face of the unknown in the jungle is refreshing. . I recently read the book called THE SIXTH EXTINCTION which I recommend to you.  IT'S not as deep or as fun as this conversation but it talks about the five extinctions that have occurred on the Earth which seemed to match up with five extinctions that I also read about that  primitive people have recorded orally ,  tho unfortunately I don't remember where I read that . I do  rexall  thinking when I began the book The  6th Extinction-- oh yeah,  indigenous  folk said the same thing.       The 6th extinction is the first one that shall be instigated by the homosapien. Believe it or not, after I finished that book, I had a sense of Peace because I felt --well this has happened before. Five  Huge extinctions in the world before Homo sapiens came into the picture and of course the Earth continues to survive. AFTER we destroy all the habitats that are essentialfir  90% or more of the current creatures on this Earth,the earth will go on         I'm also waiting two books I recommend to you THE SOUL OF AN OCTOPUS by SY Montgomery and THE SOUND OF A WILD SNAIL EATING by Elisabeth Bailey.  THOSE are fascinating forays into creatures different from us. After hearing your guest speak about the intelligence  of nature, and reading about the adaptability and intuitiveness of octopuses,as well as the maliability of snails, I frankly do not think human beings are that smart and they definitely are not the smartest creatures on the Earth.   They are uniqueky gifted at destroying the very planet upon which they live though.           One thing I remember so long ago whike traveling  hearing from a woman who was Jewish who  said to me that people have misunderstood what Darwin said. HE did not speak in terms of a species or  individual superseding all others and dominating but what he spoke about was NICHES and that each animal and each group of animals needs to find its niche and that is how life functions. ALL you need to do is to Google Darwin and survival of the fittest and you will find out that phrase did NOT come out of his mouth but actually it wasn't an economist who  grabbed ahold of it & began to use it and later it was attributed to Darwin and he sort of picked it up & used it but nevercwith theme narrow meaning  we've attributed to it.  IT wasn't his intent to justify ruthless calitalism as seen during the gilded age in America and is now once again seeing in these United States   IF you have niches,  then you won't speak of a superior being dominating and destroying those weaker than itself. It seems to me especially hearing your guest speak that actually the way that we live on the earth is  created by the interlocking forms of life in the Amazon  and we don't realize that. BUT without them,  we could NOT exist.       We are a unique species and that we are intent on destroying that on which we live and I don't just mean climate change but obviously the deforestation of the amazing Amazon and many other places. I recall reading that Greece which  I love so much used to be covered with trees and  African deserts  were covered with trees as well.  ALL these deserts are not natural but  accrued over time. I truly think that if we put our minds to it we could deal with the increasing carbon dioxide in the air since that is what plants need and apparently at different stages in the Earth's history there was huge amounts of carbon dioxide on the earth and the plants at that time needed it to survive.  WHAT I have done in my backyard is to plant seven trees while none of my neighbors have any trees in this new development. We were all given one tree in the front yard -although some people's trees have died- but for the most part most people have one tree total. . My trees of course are growing very slowly and they're very small so I'm going to try to research and see what I can do to create faster growing trees because I know that before I die they probably will not have grown that tall. THAT said there's a woman in Africa who got a peace prize who is planted so many trees and there's other people as well  but we actually need every single human being to plant a tree somewhere and every couple that has a child should plant a tree for that child.  BY increasing greatly the number of trees on the earth we will have helped with the increase  in carbon dioxide.        Needless to say the  humility of your guest when  he decides NOT to answer your question regarding climate-change i admire. I too would have to say I to know next to nothing but sometimes common Sense does kick in and therefore causes one to give an idea that may or may not work but in all events it is fun because I love my trees. I live in Central Texas and everything else I plant dies because the heat is too great in the summer but my trees seem to kick back and they make it which gives me a lot of joy. Good luck on your trip with your new friend into the jungle because I sense that you need that now more than ever and you must feel greatly honored that he is willing to take you because you're not necessarily A boy scout at heart and don't have a lot of training in these areas but you couldn't find a better person to guide you.

@lolsteelz,"15:05 Person that always inspired me to show the depths man can go to pull thru and live is Leonid Rogozov. He was a Russian surgeon that was part of an expedition to the Antarctic. After completing their expedition; Building a new base at ""Schimarcher Oasis"". Him and his crew had to hunker down and stay thru the coming winter months. During said Winter months that further cut them off from the rest of the world, more than being in Antarctica already does, Rogozov became very ill. Being the only surgeon and doctor for the expedition he soon diagnosed himself with acute appendicitis. Of course, being the only surgeon. There was no one else to help him. So after enduring extreme pain and knowing that his appendix was about to burst, which would kill him. He made the decision that the only choice was to perform an auto-appendectomy on HIMSELF. Something that had never been done in human history before. Something, he himself wasn't sure was even humanly possible. After all, to reach the appendix; He'd have to open his own abdomen and remove his intestines. . . . Rogozov picked 2 men to work as his surgical assistants and got the station director to act as backup incase one of the assistants fainted from the gruesome scene. None having any medical experience. He gave himself local anesthetic to his abdominal wall. . . After a grueling surgery in which he himself almost passed out from blood loss and pain several times. He fount the appendix with a dark stain at its base. Meaning just 1 day longer of waiting. And his appendix would of all but certainly burst. Killing him. . . Always fount this an incredible story of how far man can push himself when it is required. I recommend anyone reading into this story if interested. Tho, beware! If you have a weak stomach it is very gruesome and many articles of this story also have photos that where took during the surgery.

Yes, the climate is complicated, not it's not so complicated, that we can not make predictions for the next decades. The changes we saw in the climate during the last 50 years were literally predicted by scientists in the field and the scientific consensus on the topic. We even have predictions on this from 100 years ago, though back then climate research was a new field and it's hard to talk about consensus in a new scientific field. The accuracy with which climate-scientists predicted the changes in climate during the last decades is actually quite shocking. And it's because even though the climate is complicated, manmade climatechange is extremly evident and extremly predictable.",2년 전,0,

I worked in the forests of the northwest coast of Canada as a forest archaeologist for many years, and unfortunately, once the surveys are done, it opens up areas for development, ie. clear cutting, based in large part on the little bits of science collected by us researchers, employed to justify taking (clear cutting) some areas and leaving 'patches' that contain more 'values', which generally blow over, but which retain a few old growth understory values.",2년 전,0,

We don’t quite know the extent of that forest’s biodiversity. And the same can be said of the forests of Borneo and New Guinea. These are the areas of the planet that are most alive with life. They hold the most secrets. They hold the most promise. And yet we’re ravaging them. We gotta save these places and it doesn’t necessarily start and stop with the Amazon.,2년 전,0,

@gravesrule,"This CD has three separate relaxation/meditation sessions on it https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkxzpa8CIfZcihW4Z0F_ja0QF3W9KIatrsq guided by a very pleasant and direct male voice. Unlike so many other products of its type, this CD does not have bad synthesizer music, does not feature a phony or affected style of narration, and does not make any bogus claims to be  subliminal  or to  re-train the brain  or any of that balderdash. What you get is 1. a guided meditation for getting into a pleasantly relaxed state of body awareness while taking a stroll (superb for those easing back into a fitness routine slowly after an illness or injury) 2. A nice long breath-awareness relaxation session that if followed diligently can put you into very deep states of full-body relaxation and mental calmness, and 3. a buddhist-inspired meditation session designed to help you develop and maintain feelings of loving kindness toward not just yourself and your friends, but toward people you don't even like. The CD makes no claims to be designed for advanced meditators or for buddhists or hindus/yoga practitioners looking for very deep and esoteric stuff. It is geared more toward the average person who just wants to develop the habit of relaxation and stress relief through natural, healthy means. him, if you happen to be reading this, keep up the good work fella, and I love your accent. I would also like to note that I have never fallen asleep while listening to this product. I would like to kindly suggest to the reviewer who said this CD makes him fall asleep, that he might want to get checked to see if he has a sleep disorder, or if he is simply not setting aside ample time for restful sleep at night. A healthy person getting adequate rest at night should be able to go into deep states of mental relaxation without dozing off, if not all the time, then most of the time.",2년 전(수정됨),89,

@crypticnomad,"My great grandmother who was Quapaw taught me how to talk to animals. It is actually really easy and the more we listen the more they speak. Well some just aren't interested in us but the ones that are will talk if we listen. When I was a kid my cousin from my dad's side was teasing and saying my grandma could talk to animals and the wind and whatnot so I just asked her. The way she first explained it changed how I viewed animals from that point on. She just kinda grunted, got her dog's attention, nodded her head towards the door and the dog got excited and ran to the door to go outside. I knew she had just asked it if it wanted to go outside and it responded with a clear and obvious yes. Dogs are kind of a special case and I'd guess just about every person that has spent any real amount of time with them knows they can communicate with us. She wasn't limited to speaking with dogs, neither am I and neither are you. Humans tend to forget that we are animals too and that self distance means many of them don't trust us and if for no other reason than the simple fact that most of us are obviously lying to ourselves. Why should something else trust us if we're obviously lying to ourselves?  There are isolated tribes that have a language which lacks the concept of the color blue. When they're shown a line up of various shades of green and blue they can almost always tell various shades of green apart easier than people who speak a language from a more modern society but are simply unable, or have an extremely difficult time, distinguishing between some shade of green and what we would clearly see as blue. In some sense there is no blue and just one single band of light but through our language we have habituated ourselves to separate the already extremely narrow bandwidth of light we can perceive even further. Some languages have a concept of blue and some don't. This same sort of thing happens with ""speaking with nature"". It isn't that there is verbal communication, although certainly non-verbal in the case of animals, but still a communication of a sort. While I don't necessarily actually literally believe in animism, using a similar conceptual framework allows for one to have an entire palette of colors most don't have. Some objections I hear to this usually come from people who like to pretend, I'm being literal in my use of ""pretend"" here, to be uber logical and scientific minded. The vast majority of those people base a good chunk of their beliefs, worldview, etc on consensus but, depending on how one does that, it can be a textbook example of appeal to authority. For example, the statement ""The majority of X specialists believe Y therefore Z"" if Z is almost anything other than simply restating Y then it is an appeal to the authority of X. In addition to that, many of these people never question things like the axioms underlying the logic they love so much. If I can find a counterexample to an axiom should I actually say it is axiomatic or dogmatic?",2년 전(수정됨),19,

@loribell6453,"1:43:34 Lex you are talking about evolutionary adaptations that do not seem to actually aid function, but are still favored in the selection process. Not sure where I read it, maybe Carl Sagan's Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors, or Jared Diamond's The Third Chimpanzee, but what I remember is that, for instance in some species of birds, the long plumage says, ""I'm so strong and healthy, I can have these long, essentially useless and cumbersome feathers and still thrive!"" So the longer and more cumbersome, while not ultimately preventing survival, the more those individuals are ""preferred."" The human parallel is, for instance, young men who drink heavily, but don't die!   Or engage in other risky behaviors. As long as they don't die, they are showing off to those around them how ""tough"" they are. (And yes, there are still, potentially harmful, long-term repercussions, of drinking for instance, but those generally do not have an impact Before procreation succeeds.)",2년 전(수정됨),0,

I grew up in another part of the state catching snakes, with my ""mentor"" being ""Jim"" from Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. I appreciate that snakes represent an important part of our own brains, which may be part of the reason we project so many negative human intentions onto them. Hearing Paul talk about handling the snakes in the wild and being able to share that experience with visitors almost brought me to tears.

Amen. 26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: 27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. 28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; 29 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, 30 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 31 Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: 32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.",2년 전,1,

@ScienceSummary,"3:00:31 it's good to switch off your TV and use your time more wisely but that only has a negligible impact on your energy consumption. You need to check what consumes most energy before you make such statements to so many – heating is the top energy consumer.  Also you lump together people being ""so terrified"" or being such with reasonable well-thought-through needed responses to climate change,. These changes include stopping to eat beef and reducing meat consumption. It's not a anti-human sentiment, that would be not doing anything about it.  Animal agriculture alone would lead to failed global climate goals of dietary patterns persist as is (but they're getting even worse as Chinese etc get richer). For example half of grains and land used for such are used to feed animals. More info can be found at WP:""Environmental impacts of animal agriculture"".  In terms, of pointing the responsibility to consumers as in ""you're evil"" – that's indeed the wrong approach, policies are needed that facilitate and reward sustainable behavior instead of the opposite.

I'm a Fan of you & Seth, & now of the Twins, your 2-Channels, try watching some of the OG Ghost Hunters, Ghost Adventures & other Paranormal TV Shows, for Tips, Jason Hawes,   Steve Gonsalvez & Dave Tango from the OG Taps Team & Ghost Hunters will answer any of your Question's if you have any?  I seen your video with the Twins, in the Forest, you guys need that World's Brightest Tactical Flashlight, to light up the whole Woods?  So, the SkinWalkers were mostly apart of the Utes & Navajo Tribes when they were Warring against each Tribe in the Southwest area & the Utah Basin, but in the Native Tribes. & Some other really Bad Ass Ghost Hunting Gear, that you guys need to get, are some of these,  Flir-(Thermal Imaging Camera) Laser Grid Full Spectrum Camera, Shadow Detectors & Ghost Boxes- (such as the  Spirit Portal,  Para Portal, The Micro Portal, GeoBox & GeoPort, & a few others for you guys to look into?) & The ""Mel Meter,""- (EMF Meter) & EM Pump-(EMF Pump to give more Energy to the Spirits), & The Ovilus & the Paranormal Puck, BooBear & Doll- (Teddy Bear for Spirit Kids, it has an EMF Meter, EVP Recorder built- within it.) & know that some of my Friends who Paranormal Investigating, & what they do, is to put a Quarter in the button of the K2 EMF Meter & Maybe with the Twins, you guys both should do a few Episodes or a whole other Channel called ""The Cryptids & UFO's with Josh, Seth ?& the Twinz!"" & I hope you get a chance to checkout my Comment, & keep up the good work, making more videos & investigating.",2년 전,0,

Then, you drink from the river and it starts all over again."" - Paul Rosolie  Beauty of truth ""We live in such a human world where everything is debatable, religion, politics, and perspectives on everything. And then you get down to this point where if we do not figure out something out, the river is going to rise and take the boat. That is the truth and ain't nobody gonna argue with that. There is a beauty because then all of us are united in that truth."" - Paul Rosolie  ""Authencity is the greatest currency."" - Paul Rosolie  Lulu ""There was an orphan anteater (Lulu) on the river. JJ got me the baby and we were, like, we are gonna rewild here. I have spent weeks and weeks with her on my back. Crawling through jungle, teaching her to find ants, giving her milk, falling asleep with her on my chest. She was able to also communicate emotions. She needed it. So if this animal did not have the physical touch, if I did not hold her all day long, she would throw tantrums, she would go shred something, she would ruin the woods. She would start having traumatic response not having intimacy... It is different, it is very different. And you realize just like person's public persona when they are out on the street in Manhattan. It is gonna be very different than when you are on the couch with them on a Tuesday night"" - Paul Rosolie  Stop killing the things that keep us alive Paul Rosolie: ""I feel like I have the dumbest job in the world. Like, guys, please stop killing the things that keep us alive. The Amazon regulates the global climate, produces medicine, it is home to indigenous people, it is beautiful. Rainforests only cover 3% of land mass, it is not much to ask."" Lex Fridman: ""If you leave their home untouched, they will figure out how to have sex and multiple. Excepts for pandas, apperantly, you have to convince.""  Close to death ""One of the same black caiman that had come for the fish, he came right next to me, this giant 16-foot crocodile. He just looked at me. And it was funny because I was not scared of him, I was scared of them (uncontacted tribes). The things you learn in these moments, the appreciation for your parents, what a hug feels like. It brings new this new joy for life."" - Paul Rosolie  Beauty of life ""I think I am on mushrooms all the time genetically somehow because when I go out in nature, it is just beauty. The other thing that fills me with awe is our own mind, like the biology of these things firing. Basically, the biology of any living organism because it is like an ecosystem. These cells came together, they somehow function, they delegate, they mostly operate in a local way. First of all, it is just like you said with the anacondas, you start out as a tiny snake and you became giant. When you are a tiny snake your are prey for anything, when you are giant snake, you are prey to no one. And just that whole process, same starting with a single embryo, single cell as a human. And through the embryogenic process, constructing this giant human that is able to have limbs, move around the world, think about things, write books and so on. So you see that that is incredibly beautiful and all that is here on Earth. So actually I was being a sorr of poetic about aliens. I think I can spend 99.99% in terms of filling my mind with awe and beauty just looking down here on Earth."" - Lex Fridman  ""Do something good on Earth. Go help somebody that needs it.

@getovryourslf4444,"I hunted most of my young life for food. Elk, deer, mountain lion, and bear. Just to be clear, stalked the animal. Never used salt licks or corn piles, cameras or anything that have us an advantage. Had to be very sneaky and quiet using the wind and cover. And never downed a lion or bear myself. For about 10 years, I was a hunting guide for the 1% mostly. People like one of the greatest quarterbacks from the NFL from Denver with his kicker and 2 of the largest linemen you can think of. Congress men, owners of water companies, very high ranking military people and a few people that were stunningly rich, not Elon Musk rich but pretty close. I can remember the moment my thoughts of killing animals changed forever. 3 baby crows were dancing around in my yard almost looked like they were playing but the parent crows were flying around making all kinds of nose for over an hour. Now the reason I even went out was I was finished with the noise. I figured it out immediately that they had fallen out of the nest. So I spent the next 2 hours trying to catch then and put them back on a branch in the tree. I was so proud I went to my neighbor's and was about to tell him about it. As I was walking up his drivewa, about 75 yards from the the street to his house. I could see him with his pellet gun shooting the baby crows. They fell back into my yard and sure enough died. I was crushed by this and something inside me just changed that day. I never spoke with him again except for the screaming at him that day""what have you done""!!!! I had to pick these baby crows up that before took me hours. Now a single dark moment in time it took. I've never killed another animal from that day forward.",2년 전,0,

For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;  because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.  Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.

@LadyBug1967,"Eddufort, I've not seen Lex's podcasts for some time and when  his face appeared-- he looked so aged from the last time I'd seen  him where he had that youthful glow  and that youthful energy. SO yeah something is happening.  HE did a wonderful podcast despite it all but I think in this life he's reached an impasse or an emptiness that is not filled. I'm not sure if hugs will do it.  My understanding from listening to him is he has been searching for a mate for some time and he finds it difficult to find someone with whom to entrust his life and his love.  MEN especially, when this happens, can feel like they have reached an abyss & there is no way forward. BEFORE THIS PODCAST I SAW HIM WITH BOBBY KENNEDY AND THAT IS THE ONLY TIME I SAW HIM EXPRESS ANY PASSION WHICH WAS WHEN KENNEDY WAS THRASHING IN ESSENCE UKRAINE AND SAYING HOW BRAVE AND STRONG THE RUSSIANS WERE AND LEX SAID THE UKRAINIANS ALSO FIGHT WITH THEIR HEART THEIR SOUL AND THEIR BODY TO KEEP THEIR COUNTRY SAFE FROM  THIS autocratic huge country to the north. Basically after his one-sentence he  stopped and Bobby who is a very clever lawyer which is why he prevails as a lawyer,  did NOT pursue that point any further. HE knew he had reached a brick wall and he knew what I have said in my comment on that particular podcast that he knows NOTHING about Ukraine, NOTHING , despite his lips flapping constantly about that situation.

@jakeboyko2609,"2… 3 things the interviewee mentioned mayans built with pyramijds an how’d they do it Bcus they were talking with the gods.. soo if not gods then perhaps something not from earth “aliens”  2 if u think about it everything is made of energy which is like “god” Bcus apparently “god” is all “creator” etc etc I could go much deeper into that but not in a comment..  3 I think something important with spheres is there Bcus the deeper in u look “atoms” it’s all spheres, earth, moon, stars, planets, eveything seems to be spherical… not cube or pyramids but spheres?! Gravity is the thing but we don’t know the full understanding of gravity apart from 1+1=2 (apple falls to the mass of the ground) but is there something there with that? I’m 100% sure not one knows 100% what they’re talking about.. I know that sounds oxymoronic but it’s everywhere.  Humans have made up or proposed stuff from the beginning of time an it’s had so much influence on society, yet give it a few years or hundred an it changes.. ie mythology, Egyptian gods, catholic etc etc what’ll the next one be?  BUT if this is all energy then I personally think that we are all “god” an gods thoughst= equal life experiences, a”I wonder what would happen if I chose this decision” kinda like an rpg game but we can’t fathom how incredible gods power is an god or “energy” is just one massive thought brain an we are all apart of it.. ergo we are god… or it’s a simulation type thing an we are playing it or reliving what makes us happy… or like when I drown ur life flashes before your eyes.. maybe we drowning an we just stuck in a loop Bcus we will hit that point of where we die an what happens when we die? Life flashes before your eyes..apparently..  I guess in the end, enjoy the time we have Bcus know 1 knows so Make the best of it 😅",2년 전,0,

I still disagree with him a bit, as most of the population doesn't live in a jungle, over 90% of meat is factory farmed, and we don't need it to survive and thrive. Also, the plants that are eaten, as a hunter-gatherer, have a ton of fiber. Way more than what most people eat. Fiber and diversity are what fuels our microbiome. So his microbiome is probably insanely healthy. So his point of view makes total sense. I would probably feel the same way in his shoes. But I don't think it fits into a world where most animals are factory farmed, and there aren't enough wild animals to hunt for everyone to eat the amount of meat they want to.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

I hear stories all the time of people claiming snakes racing towards them to get them, which most of the time is a mistake in direction. The snake typically just chooses a direction and books it, most snakes have very poor eye sight and not realizing it's the same direction as a person will sometimes mistakenly move their direction. I've heard it put like this before: A snake versus a human the snake loses almost every time. Even if it's a venomous snake and it bites you it's still going to die, because it's going to take time for the venom to work. They have no desire to fight with a human The bite is only a last defense a final ditch effort to escape what it views as a lethal threat.

@maggiemoonpie2168,"I understand, only because I have an adventurous son. I taught him to read and count early and that's where it ended- his real education was time with my dad, a biologist or building and fixing things with his dad. My son could identify unique classifications of birds, animals plants and trees by age five.   By second grade his teachers tried to get me to put him on medication because he was bored, energetic and he didn't like sitting at a desk and staring at a one dimensional piece of paper for eight hours. He was a normal boy but we let him get tested, then I refused to put him on pills, especially when I learned that every child in his class got a recommendation to get tested and every child got a prescription. It's a situation of government subsidies, the doctors and the schools get a financial kickback.   l think that we're evolving, cells have memory, we carry the history of our ancestors inside of us and we need to tap into that, at our core level, if we're going to know the truth about human history and cycles of destruction. Other than learning to read and to do some math, school is a monumental waste, they're teaching an agreed upon set of  lies and with the level of indoctrination now it's become downright detrimental. Kids are being conditioned for conformity, legal slavery unawares and institutionalized living and thinking.   A boy's natural thirst for adventure- that adrenaline rush- is channeled into sex, drugs, fast cars and otherwise embracing the dark side. Or they resign themselves to their fate and escape into technology and/or conforming. I don't think enough people realize that we are going to be living off the land in our lifetime, and it will be incredibly rewarding and humbling..some will choose to lose their soul in exchange for inconvenient convenience, it's essentially bondage leading them blindly into the mouth of the dragon. We would do well to start workshops teaching children- and even adults- basic and advanced survival skills and natural living. The world is so incredibly vast, parts of it have yet to be seen by human eyes, so beautiful -yet people pile on top of each other on a concrete slab, a prison without bars.

We will become another lost civilization and start from beginning again if people don't soon see what few of see but it might be too late by the time they stop thinking we got issues and start actually seeing the world and universe like they should and start carrying but it has to be asap unless it's already too late and we can't stop it and just continue this way till one day world explodes and goes crazy,2년 전,0,

@mgeller854,"Arguably we will not be able to communicate with aliens like we aren’t able to talk with animals; it’s my personal opinion they see, hear, feel, taste and smell completely differently being they evolved in a different reality. So put on a tin foil hat to understand telepathy would conceivably would be the most realistic way to communicate between species( certain psychedelics have reportedly caused the concept ) If we objectively think about the telepathic experience it would be: overwhelming with feelings, colors, ideas, sounds, instead of simply words.

@mgeller854,"To keep the joke running “the scorpion was a new york kinda scorpion” 😅 a piece of advice for Paul if his ego isn’t too big to accept it would be bushcraft knowledge; it’s what he’s ultimately learning from the amazon and it can be applied to more than just that one place. He states how impossible it is to be there with nothing; well make it with what you do got, what’s around you?! Another thing that bothered me was claiming we don’t have “night vision”; that’s a broad generalization for us having poor visibility at night; from experience if you turn off every light around you the night starts to light up as you’re eyes adjust to less light; I find it hard to believe zero humans ever used the night to hunt when it looks like daylight on a full moon. No animals really see in the dark truly is my point: they’re able to adjust better to less light(moonlight/stars). Try one of those cameras from “night on earth” and it might radically alter our perspective of jungle night life. Much love for your perspective.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

I totally believe what he says about the emotions of animals because animals used to come and complain to the prophet ﷺ and he used to show them kindness and love, to the extent where inanement objects like rocks n trees used to greet him and once a tree was used by him ﷺ as a pulpit and a time came where they had to cut it down for a reason so the prophet ﷺ used something else as a pulpit, after a short time everyone heard someone whimpering and sobbing so the went close to the stump and it was the actual tree that was crying because it missed our beloved prophet Muhammad ﷺ stanind on it. It actually missed him! So he ﷺ ordered his companions to dig up that stump and grown it right underneath his new pulpit. Amazing! We are all connected.

@walterdewald267,"Ayahuasca is only for those willing to let go of one's human existence and get in touch with ones innermost nature - the consciousness of the source, which is the absolute non-existence that gives rise to consciousness.  I cannot agree that Aya needs to be taken only in the jungle. I drank in England and had the deepest experiences one could have. My Shamana is not a native but Israeli and  had her training in Peru in the Ayahuasca Foundation - Carlos Tanner. She did an incredible ""job"", very responsible and skilled. I drank ones in the jungle of Peru and it was insofar interesting as the ""shaman"" was in a low frequency state, fell asleep, had money stress to no end etc.... but I was experienced at that time already and had drunk for myself around 200 times, so it was not bad - the Aya was very good. I want to go back to the jungle and drink again.  Regarding the size of the Aya vine - the vine itself has no DMT, it contains the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) that stops the stomach's enzymes from destroying the DMT, which comes from either from the leaves of  the chacruna or chaliponga bush.  Every shaman gets zapped now and then by Aya, that's the beauty of it LOL. It is not even necessarily dose dependent - sometimes a smaller dose can totally take you to the greatest journeys like going to the afterlife or some interesting planets - including physically being there. Or meeting aliens and other intense experiences. Anything basically, as when one gets in touch with ones innermost nature all of creation is open for one to experience.

He is lit from within and spreading a brilliant flame of authenticity, truth, and love. Listen to his message.

I know and pretty much everyday I'm with people who have been near death experiences and I decided to watch a whole bunch of YouTube videos on it. I've studied the Paranormal and I've just gotten to that point where near-death experiences are what I'm looking into it this minute. I'm actually considering going from always atheist but now I'm changing around because I've had experience with the haunting of demonic money is a teenager. Will rental house previous tenants were doing some bad stuff. I almost died as a kid and got real sick a couple times afterwards and some other odd stuff happened in my life and then I've overdosed a little bit is an adult using opiates I am off the streets after my doctor cut me off or threatening to kill him he gave me MRSA and a spinal surgery. And he had a real bad attitude about it and try to treat it like it was me and tried to say I wasn't taking care of the wound correctly and all that but I mean it was only two or three days after the surgery or I always liked already showing signs. Anyways I got spent a whole bunch of time in the hospital again there in 2015. But anyways what he's describing does not sound like an Ayahuasca thinking it sounds like near-death experiences separate people often experience being outside of their body, going into a tunnel, but he does speak of the Void the place is dark and all that almost all in your death experience people and up their second dimension that's just connected on the other side of this one it's usually where people see the light or the tunnel with a light in it you can see is even though it's dark you can see for like a million miles you can see the end of Eternity and when you're over there there is no time in space like we know it here everything is happening like it once there it sounds completely insane. Yeah it's a real trip I'm scared to die I keep thinking man I hope there's hope it's not just Blackness I hope it's not just nothing. But I've had situations with a demon a couple dead people and some really weird phenomenon I put in a given name to. I wasn't alone in seeing hearing things thank God and beginning I thought I was schizophrenic brain cancer but other people had experienced in hurt it too and was pretty serious situation so that's woken me up to a whole other reality.

@TatooedDoc,"Loved this podcast...one of my favorites...but just stunned that someone of lex's education can be so foolish on climate change. Nope lex, most scientists at least, specifically atmospheric physicists, geophysicists, the ones that would actually know, do not believe the change in climate is man made. In fact that is one of the most foolish beliefs imaginable.  Lex drank the kool Aid. Lex dont embarrass yourself like this and get some actual legit scientists on your show. Not that Bjorn dude. Richard Lindzen, Hadi Dowlatabadi, look up what Freeman Dyson had to say. Lindzen was a Professor emeritus at your damn alma mater, MIT...YOU of all people have no excuse for such ignorance. As a fellow Drexel grad I am kind of embarrassed u are so ignorant of the  greatest political environmental scam of our time. The argument from what i would call the climate alarmists...which u echo here, is so dumb and infantile as to be nothing short of hilarious, if it were not so deadly. If these sociopaths and fools get their way they will crash our society. please wake up. I expect so much more from u.",2년 전,0,

@dukeofearl8078,"Presently we believe that information cannot travel faster than the speed of light, which means that communication between distant points in space will experience latency that would be a major challenge to a spacefareing race.  If, however, there is a means of communication that is instantaneous across any distance, then obviously space travelers would make use of that technology.  We may possibly be constantly being bombarded by alien messaging - it just might happen to be based on physics and technology that mankind has not yet discovered.  With that said, I do believe we may find that we co-exist with other advanced species here on Earth.  They just decided to move to ""a better neighborhood"".  If there is another, far more advanced, life form on Earth, then it could be extremely dangerous to our own species.  As soon as such a life form were to conclude that we posed an existential threat to them, they could almost certainly unleash a biological attack that would wipe out the human race on Earth.  Were that the case, we would do well to behave ourselves.",2년 전,0,

If you accept the idea that predicting the future of climate is difficult, then I’d rather take Elon Musks view: Even if you think the probability of the worse case scenarios is small, why run the risk? Given that fossil fuels will run out in any case. Plus the economic cost of shifting to renewables is basically below zero over the long term.  Peterson is very clever man, but here his logic is flawed. He should be more careful speaking on subjects he is not well versed in.",2년 전,0,

Anywhoo, I was 14 yrs of age, my mother was driving i, my brother, his friend & his brother home from countryside when, whilst passing farmers fields, my brother's 11yr old friend turns to me, points at a field FULL of SHEEP and says, ""What's that, what's them called, I've not seen them before""  Shocked and speechless I asked ""You seriously not know what they are?!' To which his older brother (13yrs) proclaimed ""What're they like? Cows??"" 🤦😲   Confrontation occurred when,at 17yrs of age my 16yr ol' cousin Laura, (Whom-SIDE NOTE- I had not only met for the first time days prior, but had only discovered she even bloody EXISTED then too (as well as her 17yr old brother, dad etc.... long story!) upon being asked who the prime minister of the country was, replied, ""George Washington....or is it Bush?""

@A1000EyesAnd1,He’s heavily exaggerating the size anacondas can get. He holds his hands around a foot and a half apart and goes “the head was this big”. No it wasn’t. I wasn’t there but I know it wasn’t that size as no anacondas have a head anywhere near that size and unless he’s a midget with really short arms which I assume he is not and is an average sized man it is highly unlikely that the girth of the snake was so extreme that he couldn’t get his arms all the way round it. Anacondas can get really girthy. They are the worlds most girthy snake but they aren’t THAT girthy. If you’re an average size person pretend to give a fat person a hug without quite letting your hands touch and look at the circumference of the space within your arms.  No snake species alive today is capable of reaching that size. With the possible exception it had a large meal where he tried to grip it which I doubt. It’s like the guy that goes fishing and comes home with a tiny fish and says “but you should have seen the size of the one that got away!”,2년 전,1,

@kakulkureishi7599,"This was such a breath of fresh air. Thoroughly enjoyed the epic, eye opining jungle adventures shared by  Mr. Rosolie. His job seems to be sheer labor of love. We need more people like him. Like the guest mentioned, some of us have definitely become ecological orphans not really acknowledging the symbiosis between  Earth and us . Mother Earth has not abandoned us but we have forgotten her, taking for granted her unconditional love. If anthropomorphizing helps us understand things, how can we so narcissistically ignore other living beings whose habitats we share. I remember playing with tiny frogs during monsoon (there were tadpoles in our fountain), finding red, orange and yellow lady bugs in spring in my backyard, spotting a beautifully colored newt slithering away somewhere, earth worms, leaches, grey mango bugs, Monarch butterflies, dragon flies and yes we had fire flies too. I don't see them anymore. Most frogs cant survive the heat in summers now, also, thanks to the pesticide sprays used for Dengue mosquitoes ( which I'm sure are man/lab made ) kill other harmless bugs. Similarly heavy commercialization of cities ( including my city ) has caused so many animal and bird species to migrate and disappear within a span of just 15 to 20 years. If this is not alarming then what is? Where will this end? I also  believe that life on this planet is a test of our humanness. Hope we pass it. This podcast dropped like an existential crisis.

Certainly, climate systems are complex. So is human psychology; this shouldn't dissuade the study of either. Scientific study of complex systems/complex adaptive systems has been hampered by reductionist approaches but is by no means ""too complex"" to begin to understand. We often aim to comprehend systems and their behavior by reducing them to their individual parts with increasingly powerful techniques while often ignoring synthesis… forgetting the overarching, long-term trends in evolution: biological diversity emerged relatively slowly, made leaps in complexity and diversified; changed the entire biogeochemistry of the earth system (cyanobacteria) resulting in ""long term"" trajectory: a homeorhetic system characterized by states of relative stability and resistance to perturbation... until certain thresholds are passed... then there are phase changes...  ...liquid skin/new skin/super glue works great for most neotropical microbial pests - staph, strept, leishmaniasis (if caught early).  if only there were a longer lasting and effective treatment to rid neotropical ecosystems of their true threat... invasive spps...  alas... i have no cure nor quarter... patience",2년 전,0,

As for Jordan Peterson, I have seen videos where he quite nastily patronized a student, as well as associating with people like Bjorn Lomborg, someone lacking quaiification of any relevant kind, and swallowing whole his arguments without skepticism....that same skepticism that he urges all of us to utilize. Peterson shows no interest in or compassion for nonhuman life or the places they inhabit. He seethes with anger at those who take seriously the fate of the earth.....precisely what motivates Paul.

The Book of Job tells us that humans must live in harmony with nature and seek to learn from its wise and mysterious ways: “But ask the beasts, and they will teach you; the birds of the air, and they will tell you; or the plants of the earth, and they will teach you; and the fish of the sea will declare to you.",2년 전,1,

@DaisyAruba,"24:04 the reason that people are so surprised when they see different animals helping each other out is because we are not inherently, compassionate and trustworthy, or kind to others. For good reasons, but also, as we know, we lose our innocence or imagination, and ability to just see a person for being a person, and nothing tied to that person as a judgment. So once you cross that threshold in life either you’re aware of it and you accept it or you don’t know it’s there and that’s why I think it’s so surprising because the human is seeing in two different species of animals. What would also surprise them because they would not do that. as humans are so separated by race and ethnicity is yet we are all the same species. And if you notice all the animals, maybe even the same species, helping each other out in a cute way my neighbors, new puppy just ran into my house, and my dog adult dog just had a serious surgery and this is day one of recovery at home and so the puppy was annoying the hell out of her. She’s just like oh my God you know it was so funny I wish I had had my phone and I don’t know why my neighbors would buy a puppy when they can’t take care of their two dogs but that’s their issue. Oh hey Paul, you taught me this is a different neighbor. Hey Paul, you told me about Lex Fridman like last year so you might read my comments on YouTube if you read this comment Paul is my neighbor and he told me about this podcast like two years ago I was asking for recommendations so if you read my comment hey Paul what’s Up follow my YouTube channel please trying to get monetized.

@SilenzioDiEsistenza,"The division between man and nature, man and animal, man and truth, reality..  all these are pseudoscience.    There is no factual evidence of it.     In fact the reason we can make those divisions are proof that they can be overcome..   just by letting them be, and let entropy have its way on them .   But the divisions have a function.   To relate to the world, and engineer that which is around us, our bodies, our neurology, our psyche..   social, societal engineering..     but take all these elements away, and we still are capable of living..    to mistake the tool for the fact, is the cause of many problems,..  that division has to be forced, and connection has to be forced.      No matter our actions we are part of nature.   Even if we throw atom bombs.    So the question is not, are we part of nature..   it is how can we re evaluate our traditions of engineering to create a society which creates less suffering in the world..   even though peterson is right in saying the future is uncertain, this should be no excuse for apathy.  For ignoring the violence of imposing a tradition.   Societies should be ready to evolve with the moral spiritual and technological evolution that individuals bring about..     but we should be at all times conscious that the human mind is by its nature biased.      Not just peterson, but every scientist is biased in a way, having trust in their own research..  they are just being human.   So i dont take them that seriously..  i am human as well..    whatever happens happens..  it does not disturb me.      Concerning moving to another planet.   It seems pretty cool.   I would love to travel these places.  And find out the many ways we could have been wrong about them misinterpreting data..   i would love to find out as well about what exists beyond the measurable local region of spacetime..   imagine finding out about ways to travel not based on relativity theory but quantum mechanics..   maybe we underestimate ourselves in that respect.        Escaping earth, i feel is nonsense..  this billionaire fantasy..   completely destroying all life on earth, would create a space similar to whatever we would colonize..  but in some way it makes sense, like creating a seed bank..  just the time and energy to terraform other planets..  anything we see as a danger right now, it would probably either have happened, or we would have overcome..  This amazon guy is pretty cool, worth a look into his approach..    I have been following up on ai a little..  athene (esp george carlin) and vedal (neurosama) are doing some great stuff on twitch..  using allready visual auditory information..  george carlin doing live programming and showing the dangers of ai,  neurosama playing minecraft (badly) , reacting to videos, interacting with chat and doing co ops with other streamers..  I can see why some see consciousness there..  i would not be surprised..   pan psychism and animism sound very intuitively true to me.   Even rocks feel alive to me..   i am fortunate not to have to scientifically prove it..   but it feels real to me as an individual..   i can celebrate that beauty with no concern for others",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@WalterRead1,"Lex, the largest anaconda, a Green Anaconda, recorded over the course of hundreds of years, like 5 to be in the ball park, is 30 feet long and 12 inches in diameter. It is possible for there to be a 40 foot anaconda but not one that is around 30 or 36 inches in diameter. It would have to be something like 90 feet long to get to that circumference. Reticulated  Pythons get that large but not that long. An animals morphology is determined by biology. Yes there are anomalies and mutations. So far in hundreds of years of meeting up with Anacondas there are no validated reports of anything even approaching the size the Jungle Protector described.. There were tales of such just as there are tales of Civil War Soldiers meeting up with a pterodactyl. Possible but very much not likely. It is good your guest wants to protect the Jungle and does something more than complain and donate. Being misleading will not produce good results over time no matter how good the motivation. You know this about the Government. Know it about people.  Also Anacondas are very much alone creatures, Well unless it's mating time and then there are mating balls but no lounging snakes laying about on each other. Just a bunch of over eager males trying to get the female. Once that's done the snakes part company. There was a LOT of this kind of stuff in his answers. He would do far better if he were to either spend some actual time there or, more likely, just not embroider things as 100% for certain there are far too many who know this sort of =stuff or can look it up. But the embroidery does cause one to think maybe it's ignorance. Did you know a rather large proportion of Charities and Causes are money making scams for the Principals? That is also 100% for certain. I would not like his to be a scam. Be Well!",2년 전,0,

What you need to do is present an easy and specific thing people cam do to help!!!  Like before I'm sitting hearing this and getting upset. The next thought is ALWAYS but what can I do?  I don't have a lot of money and any little money I would send how would I know it goes to a good cause?  I have a voice but where do I send that voice to?  You'll have lots of voices going to a million different places and small amounts of money going to a million different places. What someone needs to do damn it is to get a single source that everyone can get behind that would make the most difference. There needs to be a focused idea with a single vision and tight plan that will work. So all the help, all the voices, all the money can gather up in one place (with the least amount of waste) and attack this problem in the most effective way.  That's what you need to do.  Come up with an idea and plan for that to work. Otherwise you can get all the attention in the world and we'll all be sitting here thinking wow that really sucks wish I knew what to do and what would help.",2년 전,0,

From hair growth, down to the many follicles, to immune system response, to bone growth, blood cell production, internal ear canal functioning (plus the wax), neural network functionality, digestive system, intestinal flora village absortion, bacterial dynamics symbiosis, Porphyrins and its profound meaning upon man made electromagnetic pollution.  Viral dynamics, aging dynamics, nail growth rate and patterns, enamel maintenance, cellular regeneration, tissue growth, sperm and egg production, sperm and egg inception cellular Self organising/Self building dynamics (i.e pregnancies), hormonal convergence and maintenance, liver and kidneys...etc etc...

Whats a PI, you ask my fellow being?  Profound Insight.   Calcification? Neural network growth? Digestive system? Genetic memmory inprints???

I promise you, $30k customers get concierge guidance as to where to go and find a hapless creature to slam and explode a blob of lead into....for fun.  Some organized game traps calling themselves game ""preserves"" even ""corner"" an animal so the customer can shoot from the comfort of safety- like a Jeep.

In reality it was almost impossible for any city or even village to come to a decision to open the gates just inside one day. How much hell do you think will break lose if someone attacked your town? Very soon the day has run out and now its already too late because 50% is already too much a price to pay. Its better to fight. Mongols were merciless in that they did not even want the people to surrender. They ended up with more if people chose to fight. They wanted to deny people the chance to surrender.

@Jimsimi,"Ayahuasca is certainly very beautiful in the Amazon, talk about set and setting, but it is wrong to imply it is more 'real' in the Amazon, or even that it is very different to mushrooms (increase your mushroom dose it can take you to similar places). Yes, people can do it in ""Brooklyn"" and it is such a profound substance that it can, in its full glory, reach a terminal patient who is unable to travel into the Amazon jungle to do it, actually it will very easily take them out of their own bodies, let alone Brooklyn, given an adequate dose. I have lived in S.A. and have been interested in this for quite a long time, and I feel that many ""gringos"" are coming in hopes of a spiritual experience and getting a tourists trip with 'shamans' who have no traditional history with the medicine, concocting brews with questionable materials and ratios. This is not to say the real thing doesn't exist, but the potential for a bunk experience exists in the Amazon too. It has without any doubt become a tourist industry, and has been for decades now, this guys 'station' is no different even if they do great things there, it is evidently a tourism business too.  Fortunately, the medicine transcends the people or environment surrounding it, but only if it is actually the medicine, meaning it is prepared and dosed properly. Most people who have done both forms of DMT; edible and vaporised, typically will report that the Western method of vaporizing is far more powerful, while the Ayahusca or Pharma-huasca is more easy going, when a breakthrough is achieved the duration of effect on the body is irrelevant, vaporised it typically lasts about 15 minutes physiologically, but it can experientially feel like lifetimes, a breakthrough is harder to achieve on Ayahuasca and most people will never receive that dose in a tourist setting. Both do much of their work through integration after the experience, it does not matter much which you take. Many including myself believe the experience you get is the one you need, every time, regardless of where you are or who you do it with. Ideally it is best to do it with experienced and educated people, whether that is a true lineage shaman taught by their elders or just people who have made it for a long time and sat a lot of trips, it can even be yourself after seeking the knowledge and preparing the medicine with wisdom shared freely, in detail, thanks to many compassionate humans for many decades now, if there are no better options. Respect is the most important element, treat it with reverence because it is a powerful tool and all powerful tools have the potential to cause great harm if used poorly.  DMT is found in hundreds of species of plants all over the world, and there are cultures other than the Amazon tribes who likely used it, Egyptians worshiping Acacia trees, one of the richest sources of DMT, is likely no coincidence, we are discovering more and more about the psychedelic use in the Elysian mysteries and many other traditions around the globe. The Amazon is amazing, and a trip there without any drugs would be a mind expanding experience in itself, but don't try to own something that belongs to all living on Earth, it is one of many portals.  There is no reason to gate keep the medicine by implying it is more ""real"" in the amazon, and the only people I ever see doing that are people who don't know and echo or those with a vested interest in selling the experience. Anyone I know who has broken through would go out of there way to help prepare and guide someone who was put on their path in need and asking for help, if they knew how to, and do it for free, without a second thought. Having had that experience they know exactly what it means when they are put in that position. Which leads me to question Paul's experience with the substance, I think he is a beautiful person who clearly idolizes noble people who stand up for the weak and tries to live in alignment with those principles himself while balancing the often egoic requirements of this world to make a living and find a mate, I like him a lot and would love to find myself with nothing but a matchstick in the amazon with him, I can only imagine all I could learn and see, but I don't think this is a subject he has enough knowledge on to make such a strong statement, I believe it is important people know they can get this medicine anywhere in the world and it does not discriminate.  This has fascinated me most of my life, happy to share any information freely if you need help. As with love, it belongs to you already.",2년 전,0,

@warpworshiper,Hopefully this makes sense to someone. Rogan's early stand up bit about the grand canyon vs the billions of explosions in space sums up my take.  I'm glad this guy had experience beyond bucket list. For him.  That hell of a place is in the same basket ready for the next mass extinction though. I'll take my chances with cybernetics and AI allowing me to persist.  Maybe win the lottery to leave this wartorn catastrophe.,2년 전,0,

@AUDIO-VlSUAL,"The reason people raise the alarm and call for such extreme measures re: climate change is not because they think we should immediately stop burning fossil fuels or something as drastic as that. They call for such extreme measures because they know that stopping global industry and halting the forward march of capitalism is at best a herculean task and at worst impossible. Anyone raising concern about what climate change scientists advocate for are fundamentally on the wrong side of the argument. Take universal healthcare in America, polling the American public and something like 2/3, a large majority, of people agree that it's a good thing. But good luck stopping the entire for-profit medical industry and the politicians they pay for. Even when the public agrees on something, actually changing the systems in place, like fossil fuel usage, takes such monumental effort even with a consensus. So of course climate scienctists will be raising the alarms if they think we're headed into something dangerous, if they spoke mildly about it, almost assuredly nothing would happen. People shouldn't feel bad about watching TV like in the example Paul gave, but they should feel bad that our tax dollars fund the largest polluter in the world, except for China, which is the US military. On top of that, fossil fuels are a FINITE RESOURCE anyway, the systems WILL have to change, and everyone, except oil CEO's and politicians, will agree that being proactive is better than being reactive.",2년 전,0,

@logicalconceptofficial,"Finding firsthand knowledge of the Divine Creator (the Logos, the Universal Logic, the True God) is a transformative experience, providing a sense of peace, purpose, and connection to something greater than oneself. It is a fact that people do indeed connect to the objective truth and Logic that governs nature, or the Logos (God), in moments of fear and survival.  The Logos (God) tirelessly creates a Dynamic Harmony between all factors in the Logical System of all Logical Systems, including light and darkness, good and evil, chaos and order, love and hate, grace and disgrace, coherence and incoherence, and more. This Harmony is the essence of the Logos (God), and while it may not be directly visible, it can be indirectly observed in all parts of reality.  By understanding and observing this Harmony, the mind can deduce the existence and nature of the Logos (God), which can help us align with and experience the True God directly. Recognizing the Logos (God) as the ultimate source of knowledge is a rationalist viewpoint that values logic and reason in understanding the nature of the Divine Creator.  It is important to note that the Logos (God) is not a mythological figure or false God, but rather the embodiment of Reason and the true God that can provide solutions to our challenges. In times of trouble, such as when lost in the Amazon, carrying around a figurine of a false God will be a burden, while knowing the true God and how to reckon faithfully with this true God through honest, consistent, and proper logical reasoning will be our salvation.  It is worth noting that even if a person refuses to call Reason by the name of God and acknowledge rationality as supreme and sovereign, in times of struggle for survival, they still essentially submit to this Supreme and Sovereign Source of Rationality. In the midst of war or when struggling to survive in the jungle, irrational decisions can be fatal. To truly be on the edge of survival demands rationality and the ability to make the most well-reasoned decisions possible.  Therefore, even if someone rejects the idea of the Divine Creator, they still must submit to the principles of rationality and the Logos (God) in order to survive in challenging situations. In the end, acknowledging the Logos (God) as the ultimate source of knowledge and the embodiment of Reason can provide a deeper sense of purpose, connection, and understanding of the universe and our place within it, as well as the ability to make rational decisions that can help us thrive even in the most challenging circumstances.  Knowledge of the Divine Creator as the Logos (God) can provide a wealth of benefits and a deeper understanding of the universe and our place within it, including a sense of peace, purpose, and knowledge of the Ultimate Root Source of Life and Knowledge that can guide us through life's challenges with ease and success.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@magnusdahlgren3461,"Lex, about that penguin you talked about, the one you thought was going to meet his lover, and that the penguins made really strong bonds with each others. Well, perhaps you haven seen that documentary about Antarctica, and this kind of penguins - but in one documentary we can follow the penguin couples, and see just how strong bond they have to each other. And, when the male penguin couldn't find a place for the ""nest"" that was good enough for her, she didn't waste any time at al and went directly to the closest handsome, available, male penguin that had found a Good place for a nest. And they, that new couple, startad to have sex with each others - right infront of her old partner. He looked so sad.  So, that's how strong bond these penguins actually have to each others. Maybe you thought about the large ones, they have a different kind of partnerships. But maybe not these, the small ones. They are cruel to each others ... at least the female ones. The only things they think about seems to be good real estate.  Perhaps it was he, the penguin, who Herzog captured with the camera, when he ventured away into the central of Antarctica, to his awaiting death, presumably.",2년 전,0,

He seems to be conflating his truth and character being revealed in the face to death with the unanimous belief in god for everyone that experiences what he has. There’s a million believers who have never left the concrete and believe in destroying the Amazon for the growth of economies and advancement of tech. The belief in god has nothing to do with experiencing deep things or any specific view of “the truth”. But believers are often arrogant enough to “know” that their truth is somehow universal. In fact, EVERYONE thinks what they experience in unique moments (such as acid trips or near death experiences) are universal truths that have been revealed to them. That’s the illusion of the divine and the reason death is the cause of religion. If humans ever become immortal, God will truly be dead.",2년 전,0,

I love the woods in the Americas, I grew up in Appalachia, then lived in a 40 acre pine forest in Michigan, on to the Rocky Mountains, had a cabin in the forest near Mt. Hood Oregon and now in the fields of Ky. (I have to search to find forests in the middle of the state, the eastern part is fabulous.) In 2 weeks I have again rented a cabin in the Smoky Mountains which are lovely. Although I am old (66) my Mom, sister and friends have no understanding of how being in the forest makes me so happy.  ""Aren't you afraid?"" is the constant question.  This man comes closer than anyone to explaining the feeling I have alone in the woods with  my dogs.  I have always felt closer to God in the woods or on top of a mountain.  Thank you for this wonderrful video.",2년 전,4,

@domitron,"About climate change: if Jordan Peterson thinks that we are going to spend a lot of money trying to stop climate change, he obviously does not realize how much we are going to spend dealing with it if we don't stop it.  So he wants cheap?  Fine, then spend trillions now to slow climate change down and start to degrow.  But if you want to go totally bust, just keep acting like doing anything is too expensive and put your head in the sand like Jordan Peterson.  Truth be told, I suspect we will continue to basically ignore it because to stop climate change and a myraid of related problems like resource scarcity requires degrowth, and there is next to zero political or social appetite for that.  Instead people want to keep on doing exactly what we have been doing, but instead of industrial revolution, they want the ""green revolution"".  It doesn't matter what you call it, but if we don't degrow intentionally, we will degrow through mass suffering from climate change, food insecurity, water insecurity, resource depleation, top soil depleation, and it goes on and on and on...  The choice really is ours, but just know that not doing anything is still doing _something_.",2년 전,0,

@pauletteindiawoods,"Still haven’t figured out communication with any entity will be in the form of brain data or conciouness?  Every human is born to generate brain data until they die . It appears the reasons humans were born was to create brain data for harnessing .   Clearly brain data and awareness / conciouness are two separate things . Communication with any life force my theory is , it would be on the form of brain data .  And humans are governed by governments who are responsible for the intentions behind and output like this . Taking the most selfless kind person you can find - this wouldn’t be enough because of the people with their own intentions behind them . My theory is - an entity would communicate with a human like this in an individual basis. Sure their life would still end at some point but, clearly there would be something in their brain data , and or conciouness ( more of the later ) that the entity would understand which would distinguish them from other humans within the world . Think of it as being in an airport , everyone’s brain data appearing the same , except one person brain data is a bit different .  Also- CERN is a device created that tortures atoms , and electrons on the name of science . That’s the language man and humans have created - we in slave atoms, electrons , people and animals . We give our selves created for all these technologies and domestic advancements : which is used to hide that we are a species that practice’s slavery for words like science , experimenting , etc . We over all these years have only one way of extracting information and it’s through torture. We state that atoms and electrons for example aren’t concious therefore we use this an excuse to enslave them and torture them . This is the output we have created , over hundred of years even with people and animals. As years for by we get more creative with using words to mask reality. No other entity if it lives, would want to be enslaved by men who want to re-engineer everything , experiment with everything , instead of letting answers involve natural the way nature does . This is in my opinion the lowest possible way of thinking you can have bo matter too credentials , explanations, or PHD. It makes no sense to talk about it because people will give the rationality to their brain to explain instead of comprehending . Which proves my point that man has a specific way of thinking , that they are stuck connected to . Key word is man .",2년 전(수정됨),0,

But yet with our brains anything is possible right ? Except for specific thought processes in certain cases where as a human tries to move away from a way of thinking as a species that doesn’t involve slavery or torture of anything for any reason - even something so small as an atom ?

After several years of listening to Joe and you, I have even improved my English. Secondly, I wanted to put a point of view on the table. As usual, in many programs the topic of what we should change or improve as a society comes up and things like that. You jump around many ideas but I haven't seen you discuss the idea of democracy or direct democracy. It's a topic that has been on my mind for years and I don't hear anyone asking these questions. Is this the ultimate state of democracy? Can we have a fairer democracy? Why don't we vote for measures, laws, and reforms instead of voting for people? Imagine how different the world would be if instead of voting for people, colors, or teams, we voted for ideas. How much would corruption decrease if we reduce the power of politicians? The idea of direct democracy is as old as democracy itself, and with current technology, it could be a very interesting game board without really making so many changes. It would be very interesting if this started to be discussed seriously both in academic circles and in public. I hope you can bring up the topic with a guest. I don't know if I'm too late or too early to the conversation. I'm writing this message because I've listened to too many episodes of your podcast and Joe's where this idea comes to my mind and I can't get rid of it. I'm writing it hoping that by some stroke of luck, I'll be lucky enough for you to read it. Again, a million thanks. If you travel to Seville, Spain, you have a friend here.

@ajs1998,"At 2:49:20: I've heard you say this a few times Lex, but I strongly disagree that wanting immortality is wanting to escape Earth's beauty. I want so badly to be ""immortal,"" I want to choose when I die. I'm confident that I wouldn't choose to die for at least 500 years, but realistically I think I'd want to stick around for tens of thousands of years. Death is not beautiful or poetic, and it's not wrong to want to avoid it to study and experience life and Earth and everything else.  Humans barely get to 100 years old, and a good portion of those people are very different from when they were 50. Imagine if you got to keep your health and memories, and also had the freedom to explore the world and be a fly on the wall for several hundred years. Pre-agriculture, our life expectency was 20-30. Those ancient humans that wanted better health, bigger families, longer lives, etc. weren't trying to ""escape the beauty for Earth."" They weren't stupid, they saw the obvious value in living longer, and now today we couldn't imagine living only 20 years. Would post-immortality humans think the same about our 80-100 years?  I am disappointed so many people romanticize death. There's nothing glorious about it, we should hate it. The people that can't cope with the idea that death could be optional pretend instead that they aren't afraid. Being alive should keep you afraid of death, and should make you want to go out kicking and screaming because you were born in the pre-immortality ages.  ""Do not go gentle into that good night.

@carlovincetti,"This something your guest should be aware of, but also anyone lucky enough to read this. I ask only one thing of anyone smart enough to adopt this method of wound treatment. You must tell at least one other human about this discovery. This is something I have been doing for over twenty years and have found every bit of it to be absolute truth. I wondered why medicine hasnt adopted this treatment when I know it is done for plastic surgery in face lifts. Which simplified, you make a laceration at a certain angle removing tissue then joining those lines together. They use a light tape to keep the line closed. What this does is allow the body to do a reversal of healing, by healing the inner part of the wound first and not creating scar tissue, then healing the outer dermal layer last, written in that person's DNA. Then I realized the first time they tape a wound in the ER, that person is never coming back, nor anyone they know.  At first, I thought this method would only be good for lacerations, because they are the easiest wounds to heal with no scaring because of this reversal in healing. Then over the years learned it works with any and all wounds to the body. Even severe burns.  The key to this method is the lack of three vital aspects that are not present in this method. First is pain throughout the complete healing time with absolutely none. Matter of fact, that wound, no matter how bad, will be off of your mind completely. Second, is no infection whatsoever based on this tape fooling the body into thinking there is no breach and healing in reverse, not allowing air to get to the wound.  Pain or any sensation to any wound is because the body is telling you there are germs getting into the wound. Third being no scar whatsoever, but you must keep tape on the wound until it is completely gone. I personally did an experiment on an abrasion to my forearm. I put one dressing on the wound and didnt remove it until the wound was healed two weeks later. You just know it is time to take it off. Absolutely no trace that a wound was under that tape. Where the tape touched the actual wound, the adhesive was gone and absorbed by the body. Actually you can go every two days clean the wound with water then re-tape immediately with an emphasis on keeping lacerations closed completely. All other wounds, just keep the wound covered at all times. Use water to help remove the tape, and never ever rip the tape off.  This will cause secondary injuries around the wound.  The problem with store bought cloth tape, is the adhesive isnt aggressive enough to stay on the wounds at all times until you are ready to remove it for cleaning. What I use is an athletic tape used for wrapping joints to allow the athlete to perform with injuries. Any wound to an area that has hair must have the hair removed completely. Never ever put anything under the tape with the wound, especially gauze. That allows air to get to it and infection will happen. Even mild infections that only give redness around the wound will have that wound on your mind throughout the healing process for one reason or another, even if you take any pain it might provide, taking longer to heal as well. The way you know it is time to remove the tape is to touch the wound or rub it, and if any sensation is felt, it is not time to remove it.  The greatest thing to the discovery of this method of healing, is no child will ever have to suffer from any wound, ever again. The only time you will ever need medical attention for any wound, is if you hit an artery.  Here is a link to the tape similar to mine, as mine is not available at this time on Amazon.  https://www.amazon.com/BSN-Medical-BEI076168-Leukotape-Sports/dp/B000E59HXC?pd_rd_w=0RwQi&content-id=amzn1.sym.deffa092-2e99-4e9f-b814-0d71c40b24af&pf_rd_p=deffa092-2e99-4e9f-b814-0d71c40b24af&pf_rd_r=ZJG8GP4WPWZJ38G417V1&pd_rd_wg=UC1wL&pd_rd_r=b959be1f-6a33-477b-abb3-9002689c8f3e&psc=1&ref_=pd_bap_d_grid_rp_0_3_i  Mermaids are real, but you wont see them in the rivers of the Amazon.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

As our love continues to grow,  we know, nothing else will matter,  together we can weather,  any woe, beat any foe, my ego, you flatter as we write our story, and :scatter: In your embrace, I feel complete, and nothing else can compare,  with every glance,  my heart skips a beat,  and my soul begins to dance, making me feel lighter than air. With you, I am free, to be,  my truest, most authentic self,  with no need, for anyone else. A love so true and rare, together in sync, completely aware, of the unbreakable link.

@mrmrjerich,"What's your immediate and instinctive reaction to the term ""conspiracy theorist""? Like many involved in kakistocracy governments that push the notion of ""basement-dwelling, tinfoil-hat-wearing individual who is completely irrational and spends most of their time concocting bizarre, farfetched stories with little or no proof to support them? Well, congratulations, you have succumbed or are using one of the most effective terminologies hijacks and mind-control techniques ever created by the CIA. The term itself was in existence prior to the 1960's however the mainstream narrative arrived by the cia strategy paper 1035-960 and was used to marginalize and quarantine those with reasonable suspicions of state criminality. That is to say, anyone seeking the truth or questioning the official narrative should be attacked as a conspiracy theorist'. The aims of the dispatch was to target any critical thinker.   It outlined: ignore theorist's claims unless discussion about them is already too active. Accuse theorists of being infatuated with their own theories. Accuse theorists of being politically motivated. accuse theorists of personal financial gain by promoting conpiracy theories. Have people friendly to the cia attack any claims. Claim eye witness testimony as unreliable. Say it's all old new, as 'no significant new evidence has emerged. So that it's irresponsible to speculate.  Of course, this has come in very useful for secret societies and the elite should they want people to look elsewhere.  Of particular interest in historical terms is that of the 1995 BBC documentary Westminster's secret service? Included there is an open admission by a conservative party whip that paedophilia cases involving Members of parliament were not only deliberately buried but were seen as politically beneficial. Imagine what goes on at secret societies for instance.  ""Any MP who was in trouble, would come to the whips ... and say, now I'm in a jam, can you help?... it might be a scandal involving underage.... They'd come and ask if we could help... And we would do everything we can... Because if we could get a chap out of trouble, he will do as we ask forever""  - Tim Fortescue, conservative party whip, Westminster's secret service BBC documentary 1995..    I have no doubt that the government understands on Tartan day, that they need the people.  ""unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth"" Albert Einstein.

@xXxXKusKusXxXx,"1:43:20 - Here Lex is actually referring to the Zahavi's 'handicap principle'. In order to understand this it helps to think about signalling games in game theory. Basically, as long as it is harder for an unfit male to have a certain handicap than for a fit male to have a certain handicap, then having that handicap can signal high fitness to potential mates. Having a big peacock tail is hard, it weights you down and makes flying harder. Therefore, only the fittest peacocks can handle suffering such a ""handicap"", and females can infer from how big this tail or handicap is the fitness of the male. :)",2년 전,0,

The next day, it's still out there lying in the grass, no other birds around, so I called the local wild bird center, and they asked me if I could bring it to them. So I grabbed a shoebox and a small towel and went to gently capture the little guy. As soon as I got close all hell broke loose. A plague of grackles start dive bombing me then a murder of crows swoop in, even a few mockingbirds show up to start chirping about it. I had to put the shoebox on my head and and flee the scene. The crows followed me to my front door dive bombing the whole way. I even saw one writing down my address. They even posted a scout in my palm tree.

@georgetacarmen8824,"The best coffee is from Peru. It figures. The place is breathtakingly beautiful. I probably shouldn't say that. My favorite light organic coffee from Peru, is already in limited supply from all of my favorite brands. :-) I used to like hearing the stories that I heard or read from an early age about how the Indians used to respect the killing of the animals. They thanked the animal for their life sacrificed to sustain their own lives before the killing of the animal. That deep respect for the animals always stayed with me over the years. We use animals so carelessly. It's kind of outstanding how much we use animals products for. Even musical instruments can have animal products in them. Who knew? I don't even want to think about the clothing items, that I've accumulated. It's overwhelming. I still remember watching so many videos of the mass slaughter of animals in factories. The worst was seeing the mother animals with their young. I have a tender heart for the mother animals. And, then slaughter day came around. One machine slaughtered chicken in particular struggled so much after it's neck was cut and he was bleeding out. He seriously did not want to die. I could see it in his eyes, how he almost wanted to ask why was this happening? That was rough. The other chickens seemed to accept their fate. That image has stayed with me over the years. I still go to Chick-fil-A though. Sadly enough. I feel conflicted about it, if I think about it. Especially when I start to complain about the chicken not being crispy or juicy enough. It's a rough life. Having access to certain foods that keep my wellness and everything else in check is a miracle that I sometimes get used to. I should remember to make more of an effort to pray and thank God for my food/sustenance, more often. I feel the gratefulness. I just forget to voice it sometimes. :-) I feel the gratefulness for Lex podcasts. They are of great value to me. I enjoy bingeing on them. Maybe it's just because I enjoy bingeing on Lex. :-) Lex has a beautiful heart and mind. I hope that it always stays that way. Life is a long journey if you live long enough. :-)",2년 전,0,

I stood between it and my wife and told her to stay back and waited and as it got within 5ft of me I gave it a huge splash to scare it away and to my surprise, as I continued to splash massive amounts of water it actually swam into the splashing water at me very aggressively sort of springing at me back and forth. All I could do was keep violently splashing back at it backing up for about 5-10 seconds until it reluctantly swam away. It totally changed my perspective on snakes in the river.",2년 전,1,

@spaceghost8891," @Katharina643  We romanticize native knowledge and culture because it makes a great story. Humanity have learned that if you are suspicious of someone it does not give you the right to kill, that leads to chaos and suffering. If their culture is to kill on sight I don't think that is something good for them or for others and I don't think saying ""it's their culture"" justifies killing people or maintaining this culture so we should intervene somehow. There is a reason why we developed the systems that we have and although it has many problems I bet no one would like to go back to living in a tribe, even though people romanticize  it like a fairy tale of goodness, beautiful peace and nature... that's not reality. Yes I bet they have many awesome things in their culture for sure, but they are humans like us, cruel and flawed like us, and if they are killing people randomly I believe they should have consequences as any other.

@david_4739,"I did ayahuasca 11 years go in hope of getting over a mental problem (which I found out later was pure O OCD). Long story short it didn't help with that one bit but I went through a whole spectrum of good/bad experiences over 7 ayahuasca sessions. Some of the early ones were pretty much duds. Then some were more pleasant and possibly even instructional, but some were remarkably tough ...  one was absolutely terrifying... when he talks about being disassociated from himself and being alone it was kinda like that but this terrifying sense of complete loneliness. Like being trapped in a hell outside of time. And I desperately wanted to get out but I couldn't. The most unpleasant experience of my life. And you never hear those stories wen you research it before you go - you hear all the best ones. So just beware. You take the good with the bad. That's not to say you shouldn't go and do it. Not at all. But just know that there can be bad trips among the good ones. Be ready for that and don't expect just good things. Don't expect anything at all actually. Because it's unlikely you'll get it. I don't regret doing it but I wish I hadn't been sold a false idea by snake oil salesmen.",2년 전,8,

@Htrgdttuddutluts,"historically, actors in Hollywood have been exploited or compromised in sex scenes and other intimate scenes. In the past, many productions did not have clear protocols or guidelines in place for filming these types of scenes, which could leave performers feeling vulnerable and unprotected. This lack of structure and support could lead to situations where performers were pressured into doing things they were not comfortable with or were subjected to inappropriate behavior or harassment from others on set.  In the past the sex scene days were treated like a big party for the cast and crew.  People who didn’t need to be there, investors, friends of director, and random cast and crew would all show up to snicker, gawk, and snoop.  With coordinators Everything is discussed , choreographed and agreed upon in advance.  Consent is obtained for every move.

@KtotheL,I've recently have reconsidered how I spend my money. That being said I would much prefer to support the people who make and allow me to learn what is actually facts as opposed to spun truth that is inevitably actually programming.

The reason I point that out is because you're changing not only my views and helping reinforce what I already know but realizing that my support helps to improve the ecosystem as a whole. Also understand that it's happening to me it's happening to other people... That's quite a change. So not only do I encourage it but I also want to make sure I thank you for that. One of the things I really appreciate about your show there's no joke around it's 100% you're always there not zoomed out in another world or fantasy.

@mausperson5854,"""There's no ego there. There's just hope""... ""You find out what you believe in""  but you figure out what to do etc. This is the strange psychology of fear that makes people say dumb stuff like ""there are no atheists in foxholes"" when what they really mean is ""pray to God but swim for the shore"". People don't chose what they believe in and nor are they always honest, even with themselves, about what they truly believe. You are either convinced that X is true for good or bad reasons. I've never come across a good reason to believe in God. If I made a death bed conversion it would be Pascal's Wager at best. It's not a good reason to believe in god, it is a desperate hope for something which it would be disingenuous for me to say I was convinced. Same with numinous experience: it tells you nothing of the source of your awe. Dennett's notion of belief in belief seems to me to cover most convictions held with insufficient evidence.",2년 전,0,

@brutalisaxeworth3024,"I'm sorry but I disagree entirely. Ayahuasca is an experience that was cultivated and crafted by a culture for years beyond counting. It is an experience that is defined by the jungle, it's plants, the animals that coexist with them, and the people that uncovered this experience from the jungle that they consider a mother to them, and allows them to become one with it, for themselves and for their people. THAT is ayahuasca. If you drink a tea in your living room, to me at least, you are just doing DMT. There's nothing wrong with that, and it can be positive and beautiful, but understand that you are doing a drug, and not going through a shamanic ritual that ""doing ayahuasca"" is. It's nice that you know the name of the drink they prepare, and appreciate its power, but to be entirely truthful, saying that you doing that in your living room in the u.s is the same or superior to a spiritual tradition that we can't even put a date on that gave you that drug IN THE FIRST PLACE is disrespectful to the medicine, the people that uncovered it, and bastardizes what ""ayahuasca"" means.",2년 전,3,
@scentwars, @brutalisaxeworth3024  I'm sure the jungle brings it's own unique beauty and depth to the experience but I did it at a beautiful place in Florida. Outdoors with lots of trees and fire and they bring in the Shamans. Felt absolutely beautiful and amazing. Nothing seemed missing. I think the whole need to do it in the jungle thing is kind of an outdated concept that people like to repeat because it sounds good say. I understand that people like to keep things traditional but I just don't think it's necessary.,2년 전,3,

@brutalisaxeworth3024,"​ @scentwars  I'm glad that you had such a good experience. Truly, I'm not trying to say that anyone's psychedelic experience wasn't valid or meaningful... However... You almost certainly did not take ayahuasca from a true shaman. I don't mean a guy from Texas that got really into ayahuasca and started calling himself a shaman, or a native person from South America that found out they could make money by saying they were a shaman and doing a ritual for gullible westerners. I'm talking about REAL shamans from the rainforest that carry on this timeless tradition of their ancestors.   The reason I'm fairly certain you did not have one of these real shamans is, frankly, they don't leave the jungle. Why would they? Money? Don't need it in the jungle. Fame? The concept of being known outside the local area, or driving value from it doesn't exist for them. Helping others? There are no people on earth that need more people than the indigenous people living in the Amazon, their very own people, why would they go out of their way to help the people that, from their point of view, are why they are struggling in the first place.   There is literally no motivation for a real shaman to leave the rainforest. The only one I'm aware of doing it regularly is Davi Kopenawa, and that's because he is desperately trying to save his forest, and giving foreigners their spritual medicine is the last thing on his mind.   As far as nothing being missing: for DMT, you are absolutely correct. Nothing would be missing because there isn't a tradition from which anything CAN be missing. As far as ayahuasca... well... listen to the accounts of people who have taken it in the jungle vs in the modern world. It's different. It's different because the ingredients used are different, they just have more stuff in the Amazon to mix in than we have here, and only real shamans would know about that. People report hallucinating the same things in the jungle, whole groups seeing anaconda or jaguar, to the point that researchers early on thought that ayahuasca caused telepathy. That stuff doesn't really happen in the modern setting.   Again, I respect your DMT experience and an happy it was meaningful and beautiful for you. But I have to be straightforward in that I also think that saying that you ""did ayahuasca and think the jungle isn't necessary"" is massively disrespectful to the culture and people that made that experience even possible for you. As far as I am concerned, you did DMT in a shaman-y setting and you had a good experience, and I think that's great. Did you go through a serious spiritual ritual with a shaman to guide you in the way its been done in the rainforest forever? I would say not.",2년 전,2,
@muszr00m," @brutalisaxeworth3024  I understand your opinion, but it does not match up to my lived experience... One of my facilitators lived with a Shaman in the Amazon for almost a year and she trained him. During my journey I ""travelled"" to the Amazon visually and spiritually. I could 100% feel like i was in the middle of the Amazon with 3 entities and Mother Aya guiding me through it... To say you can only have this experience in the Amazon means most of the world will not get to have this experience simply because they can not afford to go to one specific location on the other side of the world. It's not how Aya works. Aya does not have an owner. If anything it has taught me that we all are our own ""shamans"". In the Amazon you are also just ""taking a drug"", location makes no difference. I've heard of many dodgy ""shamans"" in the Amazon too... Aya wants to be shared with all humanity, not kept confined to one geographic location.",2년 전(수정됨),0,
@muszr00m," @brutalisaxeworth3024  ""People report hallucinating the same things in the jungle, whole groups seeing anaconda or jaguar, to the point that researchers early on thought that ayahuasca caused telepathy. That stuff doesn't really happen in the modern setting..""  Yes it does happen in a modern setting, same visions etc... I had three animal spirits in my visions. A snake, a jaguar and a crocodile... All three were helping guide me through the jungle, plus Mother Aya's all encompassing presence.  I spent 2 weeks doing dieta and doing nothing but meditating before the experience. The moment it was time to drink, it felt like i had already drank it and Aya's spirit was already in me.  I live all the way in Australia. Geographical location means nothing. Mother Aya's spirit is all around us, you just have to tap into it.",2년 전(수정됨),0,
@lievenyperman9363," @brutalisaxeworth3024  I know that's not exactly what you mean, but psychedelic experiences are not competing with one another. I have no doubt that there is a uniqueness about the traditional rituals and Shamans but there is also the factor of the individual taking part. The traditional lineage of what you're describing would only be complete if the participant in the ritual is also brought up in that tradition and tied in with the indigenous culture and habitat. A Western tourist brings his own consciousness to the experience. The OP's comment was about having psychedelic experiences for personal improvement or psychological benefit. The traditional experience may be unique (Although all psychedelic experiences are imo), but psychedelics are about an inner journey, a consciousness shift, healing trauma, and overcoming fears. The Shamanic rituals in the Amazon are developed by and for their specific culture, the Jungle and traditions carry with them their own cultural and traditional obstacles and psychological hurdles. So if a Western person wants to get the most benefit from a psychedelic experience, ayahuasca in the Amazon might not be the best way to go precisely because it is an alien setting to them. (mind)Set and setting are crucial for psychedelic experiences. If you are distracted by fear of the Jungle or feel uncomfortable in the traditional setting, it could affect your trip in various ways. That being said I loved reading your comment and your respect for the ancient tradition and I share your gratitude for these traditions to carry the psychedelic wisdom into our current time.",2년 전,2,
@Shapeguydude,You could also just do LSD (or make a DMT/maoi mix yourself) and you don't get the whole drinking mud / projectile vomiting thing either,2년 전,0,
@muszr00m," @Shapeguydude  Interesting thing is not everyone vomits. I have never vomited on it even though i have had powerful doses. There were a couple of times near the end of the journey and after rapé that i released a few entities through spitting into a bucket, but that was about it. Think the vomiting thing depends on the person and their diet leading up to consuming... I definitely would not be comparing LSD to Aya though, completely different.",2년 전(수정됨),0,
@Shapeguydude," @muszr00m  fair enough, but I vomited extremely hard and my experience was fairly comparable to LSD. Hopefully we can at least agree that the DMT and MAOI combination is what leads to the psychedelic experience, not the extra 99% of bark/mud in the mix.",2년 전,1,

@cyrus05w," @matthewgenovese8988  just chewing over your comment and I remember maybe a reference to this of what you question. Let's take beavers for example, beavers are natural creatures found in the wild which have no extreme tools but maybe minor and insignificant tools that we wouldn't even consider such. It itself though can destroy the biosphere around it by misplacing one of its dams or not knowing what the next season would bring and having one of his damns block up a outlet. Wow this was explained to me by someone I believe the reference is a stick stuck in the river will find its way out over time but I stick stuck in the sand may stay there much longer. We as a species play stuff into areas in which they do not exist friar, a good example of this would be the banana peel it seems natural but placed in the tri-state area it will not biodegrade as it would if it placed into its natural zone there are no bugs there are no critters there is no wildlife that has any interest in a banana peel if this also helps. I believe though that fever ordeal would be a good example it does natural things but causes unnatural things to occur, there was a point in time where humans were more in tune in nature but because of coalescent theory I believe we're finding ourselves farther and farther away from this.",2년 전,3,

Thank you for not picking also but happens a lot these days, it seems like with the possibility of being connected with one another with become so distant from one another.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@ExiledGypsy,"You don't have to be an environmentalist to realise how problematic human race is.  Just liaten to the nonesense Lex is saying about growing up on another planet. After all this he still doesn't understand that we are part of our environment.   By the time you get to be able to grow up on another planet which if it ever happens is much further in the future than we think, it won't be even human. Then he calls himself a  scientist. You were losing your sanity after a week alone in Amazons. Just imagine the alination you will feel on another planet.  Now Orcas are attacking us. I wonder if other animals are just tolerating us and one day they just say enough is enough .",2년 전(수정됨),0,
