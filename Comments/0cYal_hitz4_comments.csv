It's much too soft and it's complex configuration makes it prone to injuries.   Thats why some modern shoulder surgeries swaps the ball amd socket, implanting a ball into the shoulder and placing a socket in the arm so the muscles pull the arm so the newly formed socket arm slides around the ball in the shoulder.",3년 전,7,

@smithsmith131,"...........  Fibroid Treatment ........... As a sign of gratitude to Dr. Taiwa Abu for how he completely cured my wife from fibroid, I decided to reach out to those still suffering from this Disease.  My wife suffered from fibroid for more than 6 year of marriage after our first son and it was really tough and heartbreaking for me because she was my all and the symptoms were terrible, she had irregular and painful menstrual flow and the size of it was 6cm, and she always complain of stomach pain. We tried various therapies prescribed by our neurologist but none could cure her. I searched for a cure and I saw a testimony by a woman from the UK who was cured and so many others with similar body problems, and she left the whatsapp number.. +2349047218377   of the doctor who had the natural cure for fibroid. I never imagined fibroid has a natural cure if not surgery not until i contacted him and he assured me my wife will be fine. I got the herbal medication he recommended and my wife used it as instructed by  Dr.Taiwo , and,after 4 weeks we went to the hospital for a scan and the doctor confirmed that there is no trace of fibroid and now she is fully okay, even up till this moment she is so full of life. fibroid has a cure and it is a herbal cure contact  doctor,  Dr. Taiwo Abu for more information about this natural treatment....... you can contact Dr. Taiwo by: Email: drtaiwoabu@gmail.com ..... OR Call/WhatsApp him on: +2349047218377",4년 전,0,

I want to also share this amazing review to the world about this great African traditional herbalist called Dr. Abili, who helped cure my 18 months HPV WARTS  (HPV) with his powerful herbal medicines, I suffered from Genital HPV for 18 months, for this period I visited several hospitals and used several medications but there wasn’t any solution until I came across the website of Dr. Abili ( drabiliherbalhome@gmail.com) while searching for help. I found out there was so many amazing reviews about him and how he have cured so many people around the world with his herbal medicine, I decided to give him a chance to help me cure my HPV virus too and I contact his email :(drabiliherbalhome@gmail.com)  I explained what I was passing through, he gave me hope and assured me that I will be cured and saved from my genital HPV  with his medicines. I followed his instruction and he sent me a powerful Herbal Medicine through the Courier Service and took for 2 weeks and my HPV disappeared and completely healed. Am so happy for the great experience and in case you have the same disease, I will advise you to go straight to this great man on drabiliherbalhome@gmail.com  or WhatsApp him: +2349034412845.

Also a slightly separate, but unlikely element:  what about the ball shape? Is that even connected connected to the Ulna?  If so, could that not possibly be a fourth joint?

I avoid that to prevent the risk of damage of course. But when I was young I did it often to freak friends out cause of the sound it'd make. Sometimes it locked up on me as well. Kids do stupid stuff. lol  Anyway, pointing out the jaw joint would in your PDF and in a video would help as well. A LOT of fellow artist, I know, thought it was just a hinge joint. Others thought it was type of Ellipsoid joint. A solid confirmation would help them a lot. Myself as well.  Thanks again for the video, reply, and extra knowledge.",10년 전,1,
