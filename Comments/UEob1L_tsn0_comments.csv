@MythicSuns,"2:33 This kind of reminds me of Patrick Stewart talking about how a french accent never would've worked for Jean Luc Picard before immediately using an exaggerated french accent as an example of one that wouldn't work. To me such accents could work if they were less exaggerated. John's normal accent would've been fine for a stormtrooper, especially in a galaxy where the accents are pretty much all over the place. Yeah troopers tend to have similar accents but it's never explicitly stated that they need to have 1 type of accent.",2년 전,0,

@RasMajnouni,"B""H,People!What started as  Corona  (""Crown"" in Spanish)  we among the Chabad Chasidim saw as Crown of Messiah.If you listen here to this teacher of whom I have reviewed hundreds of his video Bible lessons over and over and over again for 43 years yet this video from Nov.8  he says things about the Messiah's arrival in ways he never mentioned before.He explains in the beginning that Corona  has proved to the not-yet-beleivers  that medicine obviously does not have the answer (NO one wants to go to the hospital today for a check up or to visit a dying friend )that science often IS the problem,that politicans are all not leaders anymore,Hollyweird is sick,money took a dive and it is no longer a god,in short all the false idols are dead and the world has become a dry desert aching for water and ready to seek out Messiah.But  at least listen to the second half of the video,the teacher has always shown the positive and good of G-d but here he explains that things are already getting much better by the minute  and as it is written Prophet Micah chapter 7 :verses 15,16""I will show him{you} wonders"",  As in the days of your exodus from the land of Egypt, I will show him wonders.	 	טוכִּימֵ֥י צֵֽאתְךָ֖ מֵאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרָ֑יִם אַרְאֶ֖נּוּ נִפְלָאֽוֹת: 16Nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might-they shall place a hand upon their mouth; their ears shall become deaf.	 	טזיִרְא֚וּ גוֹיִם֙ וְיֵבֹ֔שׁוּ מִכֹּ֖ל גְּבֽוּרָתָ֑ם יָשִׂ֚ימוּ יָד֙ עַל־פֶּ֔ה אָזְנֵיהֶ֖ם תֶּֽחֱרַֽשְׁנָה:   Messiah will be so much better than we thought he might be,the physical wealth hidden in the earth will be siscovered and humans will be so well off there will be no need to steal,no need for competition and wars and we will seek out  the Infinite Light and knowledge of G-d only.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve9PSK88Kts&ab_channel=ChassiduswithRabbiManisFriedman",4년 전,0,

But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”    And if anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.",5년 전,0,

I don’t watch any of those guys any more (especially since they all decided to talk politics to be “relevant,” as if any of them had anything of value to say, honestly).  Come to think of it, I haven’t watched US broadcast networks for years, except for couple of the late night shows, and now that is over with.  The Left in our country has become so fixated on Donald Trump that they’ve ruined themselves.  We just watch mostly Amazon Prime, some Netflix, even less Hulu and most of those shows we watch are from British, Scottish, Irish, Swedish, Norwegian TV and movies, etc.  Thank goodness for subtitles.

@avoolo1avoolo125,Hi! Do you want to be widley known on Instagram? I've been seeking for an easy way to now become well known on the gram for many years now. I managed to evolve my small business with the assistance of this hassle-free strategy of acquiring followers. I launched a watch company a short time back and my previous partner honestly left the venture due to the fact we were doing so inadequately. I had tried out all sorts of things until I stumbled onto this. It managed to get me to over 100k followers and right now I'm offering up 12 watches a day and have an extraordinarily solid living. I additionally expanded my personal account to over 50k followers and finally all my pals envy me. It can be impressive to show it off to the fair ladies that I interact with at nyc pubs. I will have to provide help to do it as well because you thought to look at my story. Simply pay a visit to the web site listed on this vid and thus type your chosen IG username. ➡️ _Just search this here on Youtube_: biginsta5000 (NO SPACES),7년 전,0,

@mena94x3,"Reese Horton  -  Tiny how?  Also, attractiveness is something that involves a variety of factors, that are different for different people and many of which are often subconscious - you realize in the moment for whatever reason that you find the other person attractive.  This can even happen to people you wouldn’t normally find attractive, but the way they do or say something suddenly makes them attractive in that moment.  It can go the other way as well.  Someone you outwardly have found attractive for a while can suddenly lose their appeal when some of those subconscious factors are violated.  Often this involves character traits - both directions (someone you normally find unattractive suddenly becomes attractive because of an amazing character trait they displayed, and vice versa).",5년 전,0,

I would suspect at some point in his career he must have done celebrity impressions but I don't recall ever seeing him do one.   He always seems to fall back on Stewie or Peter or one of his other myriad creations.  I know Seth does a great Kermit the Frog...and he's done Liam Neeson by way of his Kermit impression...but, as with Peter singing Cindy Lauper, Seth doing Kermit doing Liam doesn't exactly qualify as a true impersonation of Liam.  Impersonation by proxy...does that really count?  And Jim Carrey does an outstanding David Caruso impression.   Why Jim didn't do his David Caruso as Horatio Caine from CSI:Miami here is anybody's guess.  (I actually made a David/Horatio meme not all that many years ago that basically said ""I guess Jim Carrey's impression of me wasn't bad...IF you still find Jim Carrey 'funny'..."")",7년 전,1,

My Mum and sister past their test first time, my Dad took six times and my brother is about to take his second attempt. Also, some men can multi task and not all women are great in language an some men are. So actually, I suggest you get educated before you start to generalise and stereotype genders.",9년 전,0,
@FantastyckplastycK,"well, you are cherry picking here, of course i didnt mean that there are no women with humro or no men that can multitask. we are talking percentage and probability here. for the start read men are from mars and women are from venus and if you like it continue on with  human instinct by ray winston. it explains very well why men are so much more adulterous and lots of other differences between men and women. actually the sexes have different brains, hence the dissimilarities. anyways, if you are truly curious you will find answers, i hope you are not a sad case of feminism though",9년 전,0,

But, indeed, the Internet isn't the best place to learn proper English grammar: numerous people, even native speakers, make (often basic) mistakes :/ But I guess I'm extra attentive to this, since English is my 3rd language and I've had to learn it ""from outside"" (does this make sense to you?). An additional way to improve your - already very good! - English could be to read books, lots of books. That helped me a lot. One crucial advice: books originally written in English, not translated.
