@allyenderman1502,"I started working at a pizzeria recently as a kitchen/prep lead. It's Chicago style, both thin and deep-dish, but the thin crust is remarkably similar to this process. Also I never realized how ludicrous 7.5 pounds of cheese was, even after having worked in a deli, until I saw how much space 20 pounds of shredded mozzarella takes up. It's a five gallon tub, and it's almost overfilled by the time I've shredded the entire mozzarella monolith. 7.5 pounds would take a little more than a third of that space. It's ludicrous.  Then again I have a household of 7, all of whom love pizza more than life itself, and I feel like 7.5 pounds of mozzarella would be a decent investment for me to get eventually.",3주 전,0,

@Kieranliautaud,Use the exact amounts and the same type of dough. Spent 10 minutes kneeding for the texture to not have change at all sticky and unworkable. Had to add dough then wet hands kneed more let it sit 1 hour kneed again let it sit 30 ball it into four and then let it rise. Horrible recipe the ratio’s are way off. Way too much water aim. Aim for 2 cups of water no more,4주 전,0,

@Anoudyoo,I’ve never been successful at making a dough but when i saw how it poofed up after leaving it for 1 hour I was so happy Nothing in my house matched the ingredients mentioned in this video for example:  i used all purpose flour Used an active dry yeast that expired 4 months ago and i dont think it bloomed I only found a bit of olive oil so i used it and add vegetable oil as well And i don’t have a metal thingy for the pizza so i used the usual round metal things I kept kneading and it kept sticking and pissing me off but i pushed through and it all worked out in the end I’m excited to make more tomorrow with the leftover dough i bet it will be better since i left it for a whole day P.s.don’t be afrad to add as much flour as necessary i put too little thinking that kneading will help it be less sticky but that’s not true just add flour until it no longer gives you extra fingers,1개월 전,2,

After a almost a full day in the fridge it certainly didn't look like the vid...had to Geryrig a bit and got it going.  I've seen ""1 packet"" (2.25 tsp) for 2.5 cups of flour elsewhere.

@philipm3173,"Fairfield county, CT checkin in, that was a good lookin pie, the main disagreement I have is letting the dough sit for up to a week, they become difficult to work with after 4 days in my experience as a pizza chef, too bubbly (yes that is indeed a thing) . Also there are better techniques for forming the dough into balls to prevent too much air from getting into the dough, I like to basically turn/push it into itself and then you want to squeeze between your thumb and forefinger with a twisting motion. The doughs gotta be ""toight!"". When you stretch the dough you have to work it with your fingertips first so you can shape what will be your crust evenly and imo the toss is essential. I prefer to use a silicone brush to apply the sauce. You should put more cheese around the outside than the middle because as it melts it will naturally flow into the center from the crust and you don't want it to pool in the middle. the end",5년 전,0,

@Navii-05,"Hello. So, what I want to do with this message is to simply show what the Gospel is.  I am not trying to force my belief down people's throats.  It's your choice whether you want to accept it.  So, a question: Do you think you are a good person?  If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, watched adult material? All of those are sins and anyone who sinned is not good(on God´s standard). You, I and most( most because babies don't sin, and maybe specifically mentally Ill people) purely human beings have violated God's moral law.  Since God is just, He can not let sin go just like that. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve, we deserve to be punished because we have sinned.  The reason why blood must be spilled for forgiveness of sins is because the life of the flesh is in the blood, in the Old Testament Jews sacrificed animals for sins but the  sacrifice of animals were enough to temporarily cover some sins. (it did not allow forgiveness of sins, unlike Jesus´s, it only temporarily covered them)   Jesus is the Lamb of God, the ultimate sacrifice for sins which is enough for all sins that have been done, are done and will be done. He was buried and rose again. His  resurrection proved that His death was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins.Jesus paid our  penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must trust in Jesus's spilled Blood, His finished work on the Cross for our salvation. And then your  sins will be forgiven because of what Christ did, you will be saved.  See: Romans 3:10, Romans 3:23, Romans 5:12, Romans 6:23, Romans 5:8-9, Romans 10:9-10, Ephesians 2:8-9, John 3:16, Leviticus 17:11, Ephesians 1:7, Colossians 1:20,  1 Corinthians 15:1-4. https://youtu.be/lbb4xwYj19g Evidence for God´s existence: Kalam cosmological argument, Contigency argument, Modal ontological argument. Regarding Christianity, check out InspiringPhilosophy´s videos about the Ressurection of Jesus and the reliability of the New Testament. Together, they show good evidence that Christianity is true.-",4년 전,0,

@RandyBeeer,"As a native NYC’er, I can tell you that this is not a NY pizza. I understand that home ovens don’t generate enough heat for making these pizzas but at 550F, there is enough heat to melt cheese and brown the bottom. If not, allow the done pizza to rest for 5 minutes and then place it back in for 3 minutes. Guarantee this works. In addition, sugar and oil is not normally used in a pizzeria. I would never use less than .25 tsp sugar to activate the yeast, but no more!  And the amount of oil being added (twice) is excessive. You are just about making a Detroit style pizza without the sheet pan, thus frying the bottom of the dough. Lastly, corn meal?  This is the most offensive aspect of making this “NY” pizza. Maybe Domino’s does that. Make a little effort and buy semolina flour. The pizza will slide off the peel without the sand texture of corn meal.  That all being said, nice video and nice pizza. For me, pizza is cheese, tomato sauce, and a thin dough which has been constructed here. But specifically a NY pizza - Nah!",2개월 전,0,
@PatWoodworth-y6c,"Followed the recipe but use kitchenmaid mixer with dough hook.  24 Hours later it wasn't bubbly and high like yours out of the frig..  Tested the yeast as in the recipe and all was good.  After opening the glass container I left it in a warm area for a bit and it got better and was really soft when I stretched it out.  Pizza came out very good using a steel but I still would like it browner.  I think I will try baking the crust first and then add the toppings.  Any thoughts on why it didn't bubble up high in the frig?  Will wait another 24 hours to see what happens with the other 3 balls.  Also, may need a little more salt.

@salockin9515, @Versacici No I did not. However I after 10-20 minutes of kneading I usually just move on to the next step. I have made this recipe about five times and it has turned out great all five times,6개월 전,1,
@themarketm8382," @Versacici  it shouldn’t be stretchy at this point. When you’re first kneading the dough, the purpose is to obviously bring everything together, but also you’re trying to build gluten which will eventually make the dough stretchy once it’s rested & also you’re building internal temperature so the yeast is in an environment to rise.   You can actually overwork the dough by kneading too much, causing it to get too hot where the yeast massively multiplied creating a big weak doughball that can’t support itself.   What I do with this recipe is this:  1. Get some lukewarm water into a mixing bowl, about 30-35c hot. Get the yeast in and optionally you can add sugar, but allow the yeast to work for 10 mins so you can see its alive.  2. Pour in the oil & put the salt into the oil, don’t just throw it all in because it can kill yeast at this point. Most more professional dough recipes would add salt at the end.   3. You want about a 65% hydration ratio. So if the water is say 265ml (half the recipe gets me 3 doughs of ~240g each which is enough) then you will add 410g of strong bread flour, it has to be strong white or pizza flour, normal plain flour or 0.0 without a high protein content wont work.   Work it with a mixer until its come together or use a rubber spatula or something that you can bring the dough together with for 5 mins without getting it all over your hands.  Once that’s done, get the dough onto a counter and sprinkle some flour every time you need it, its no harm. After no more than 10mins allow the dough to rest back in the bowl for an hour. Once that’s done, take it out and divide into 3 equal balls. Let them rest for another hour roughly & you can then use them or put into the fridge and it will keep for at most 2 days. Any longer and the yeast will multiply too much & the dough won’t be able to support itself and tear easily. Make sure you watch a good stretching tutorial, the dough isnt a perfect recipe so it can still tear easier than a professional one that you see people throwing and grabbing easily",5개월 전,0,

@MaggsyMaggs,@ rn I actually cook these “crazy puffs” over pizza I saw it in a YouTube short from a comedy channel apparently it’s supposed to be little Caesars inspired but we don’t have that in my country and they are goldy if you type crazy puffs pizza into YouTube it comes up as a YouTube short   I’ve even found you can make the dough (with sugar) and leave it for one hour to rise and just make the puffs straight away and it comes out the same as dough you have cold fermented for 48 hours I highly recommend   The batch I made today I made the dough last night and had no cling film or (plastic wrap” to cover it over night so I wet some parchment paper and covered it tightly with that but the air got through and dried the top out and I think that messed them up but they are good enough i know not to do that in future I guess and anyone who listens to this message can learn from my mistake   Not that I think most people even know wetting parchment paper makes it more easy to wrap over food I learned that from watching like 50 videos about cooking lamb legs when I had 4 lamb legs and I was bored in the evening,7개월 전,0,

@frostnovaomega1152,"Tips for my fellow germans if you plan on making this recipe: We don't have the same flour types. Type 812 is the closest to what Adam uses, but Type 405 is completely fine in my experience. Be prepared to add a lot more flour than this recipe calls for, i have to use almost double. If you don't have a Pizza Steel or Stone, you can make it with a sheetpan. Preheat your Oven at 250°C, Convection mode works beautifully. Preheat your oven and the baking tray. I usually do 30 minutes. You can take the pan out, and then assemble your pizza directly on the hot tray, you don't have to shimmy it off a peel. The sheet is thin enough to heat up again quickly, especially on convection mode, and that first bit of heat helps to cook the bottom slightly faster.  You are probably not gonna find low moisture mozz, or San Marzano tomatoes. Pre-shredded mozzarella and regular canned crushed tomatos are still gonna give you a nice pizza. You might find Mutti-brand San Marzano tomatoes in certain Rewe, Hit, or Edeka stores. So if you have them, congrats!",11개월 전,4,

@ArturHolindak,"We tried this recipe, following the instructions to the letter but the dough was so thin it resembled pancake batter.

@einfachnurleo7099,The dough is on the fridge now however there's one thing that confused me. I've tried to make less (2/3 of the recipe) to be exact. So I wanted to use 400ml of water and 400g of flour instead of the regular 600 each. Now the dough was so unworkable that I had to use 600g of flour for my 400ml. You'd assume that the dough is too dry now which it honestly might be but it non the less confuses me by how much I'm off.   Now the video does seemingly state more water than the description so that might be a reason and I'm not using American flour but I'm not the less quite surprised and excited on how it'll turn out.,1년 전,0,

@fennerolivia,"I have been making homemade pizza for about a year now but I never felt like my crust was beating pizza delivery quality until THIS RECIPE!! The details in the video are so helpful and this is the perfect crust recipe.  A few tips for other beginners like myself:  1. I use less water than the recipe in description calls for because I have a hard time balancing the flour to water ratio when I'm kneading, so I use 1.5 cups of water and go from there  2. Let the dough sit in the fridge for a couple days, it will be much easier to stretch the dough into a perfect crust shape and will not constantly shrink when you're stretching  3. Stretch the dough on top of wax paper to make for easier trip from counter to the oven.

It tasted great.  the other problem was the dough was a bit too thin in the center to hold itself together.  the next one I'll avoid these mistakes and it will surely be a homerun.

The only thing that u got right was like sauce and cheese but the dough is way too hydrated to be considered New York pizza. 5 cups of flour with 2 1/4 cups is an 85% hydration. That is crazy high for even Neapolitan pizza. Furthermore, a signature New York pizza is the round shape not an oval or some disfigured circle.

@jdmfsdjs," @zenon.castillo  lol man your reasoning is beyond stupid, and also, you cant comprehend what Im saying, even though its pretty simple. Im afraid theres no point of explaining it any further if you are unable to understand something such simple, but once again: there is no such thing as ny style pizza. what you call italian pizza is the same thing as what you call ny style pizza. pizza comes from italy, hence, pizza is ""italian"" pizza, and not ny style. italy existed before ny. therefore pizza cant be ny style, its italian, but you dont have to call it italian, its just called pizza.  your example with hawaiian pizza makes no sense. a pizza is just a baked dough, regardless of its toppings, you still call it pizza. so naming a specific topping on pizza has nothing to do with the argument over pizza being ny style or not, ny style is not the topping, it refers to the thin crust. but you know, all pizzas have thin crust (except for deepdish), italian pizza has thin crust, therefore, what you call ny style, is in fact just ""italian"".  your other example is just as stupid as your first one, like I said, ""ny style"" pizza is the very same thing as ""italian"" pizza. south america is not the same thing as north america, both are part of the americas. so its absolutely not the same as ny style versus italian, because (do I have to help you, or did you finally manage to understand it?) yes, they are the same thing. south and north america are not the same, ny style and italian pizza are the same. get it?",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@jdmfsdjs," @zenon.castillo  people can change the recipe, exactly, and thats how they made the deepdish pizza. you still couldnt specify whats the difference between ny style and italian pizza though. ny style means its this crusted, just like italian pizza. so once again, whats the difference? how is it made in ny that its different from italian? its incredible how you can avoid such a simple question (actually not surprising, obviously, you avoid answering this because you cant answer, because they are exactly the same style, which means there is no ny style pizza)",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@grwbt8703,"Thanks, Adam. I boiught the cast iron ""stone"" and it does indeed work well.  However, 1. cast iron is heavy! My wife has trouble lugging it in and out of the oven. Also, maintenance for cast  iron -- cleaning, seasoning, etc. -- is a bit of a pain. 2. For a while, I had trouble getting the pizza onto the cast iron ""stone"" without spilling pizza toppings onto the ""stone"" and thereby burning stuff. [Note: we load up our pizzas with veggies, Kalamata olives, sauteed mushrooms, Italian sausage, etc., so they're not so slim as your yours.] The solution was to build the pizza on a sheet of parchment paper (suitably lubricated with with coarse corn meal), slide the peel (also lubricated with corn meal) under the parchment, then get it onto the ""stone."" No spills. Works great. It's best to trim the parchment around the pizza because, at 550 degrees,  parchment can get a bit burned if left flapping in the breeze.",2년 전,0,

@jaredf.5607,"I own a pizza restaurant that cooks NY Style pizza. You got so much right! The extra Virginia olivie oil is a must, the bread flour, yes.   You have to use a stone. The stone is like a cast iron skillet, or a Dutch oven. You don't scrub them. You want the flavors left to enhance the future food, to give it a grilled taste. You have to use a stone. I recommend seasoning it on a backyard grill.   Kraft has a pizza cheese with high fat, low moisture mozzarella cheese. That is the best to commercial that you can find.   Also 1 day to 5 days is the time for fermentation in the fridge. After 5 days the dough becomes too wet and won't crisp how it is supposed to.   The heat is so close to commercial it will definitely work. Make sure the stone is preheated in the oven and use a pizza screen.   Once the outside of the crut is the color of cardboard, remove it from the screen and toast the bottom.   Good luck and great pizza!",2년 전,1,

@gaganr7607, @gillythekid  generally in baking it’s way more accurate to weigh ingredients than to measure them by volume.

If you divide the liquids by all the flour that should give you the percent hydration by weight and should be more accurate.,2년 전,0,

@PokerJunkie83,I like the fact that you’re only using a teaspoon of yeast in the dough. I see people use 2-4 tsp for the same amount of dough and it’s obviously unnecessary because your dough bloomed just as much if not more than all other pizza doughs I’ve seen. I can’t really eat a lot of yeast so this is definitely a nice change 😊,3년 전(수정됨),0,

It's not ""fermented enough"" or something like that, it's just overproof, that's it. 5:10 If your dough looks like this there is soooo much bacteria in the dough, you could use it as a starter, add 3 times of flour of it's weight + water and make a new fresh dough that you can properly use. I'm not saying you can't eat it but you might aswell just make the same recipe with 3 times the amount of yeast and wait 1 day instead of a week, and it's gonna feel and taste the exact same. By waiting a week, all you are doing is let the bacteria to reproduce, it's not gonna magicly have some kind of aged taste, the reason why it tastes different is because there are much more bacteria in the dough then it should be.",3년 전,2,

@bgaviator,Ok I’m new to pizza making. I’m still in the research phase. But something seems off about this. The yeast amount seems really high compared to most other recipes. Most recipes seem to be around 3-3.5 grams yeast. And the hydration is way way off. I know in the video he adds more flour until it’s workable…but c’mon…just tell us the amount. Seems like most nyc pizza is sitting around 62% hydration so for 530ml water we would be looking at 855 grams of flour if my math is right,3년 전,4,

@JonCausithONS,"This was a really intensive, nerve-wracking and yet super fun pizza recipe to follow! For the dough making, I followed everything, although I added garlic powder inside of the dough as you did with the Pan Pizza recipe as... well, I'm a fan of garlic, haha! It took a long while for the dough to get the dough workable - there was quite a bit of time and flour used to get it into that quality where it would stretch and not break.  I separated it into three balls instead of four, as I didn't have too many containers that could fit the dough balls + I had a pizza peel that allowed for larger than 12 inch pies.  The sauce, I followed very closely with the measurements, though I used Mutti crushed tomatoes instead of Pastine - I liked their sauces, but I wanted to work with the brand to make something close to what the recipe called for. (the only thing I added was just a touch of garlic powder.)  As for cheese, on two pizzas I just worked with low moisture whole milk mozzarella sticks grated/cut into strips, along with shredded parmesan, though on the third pizza I used that, plus cut up some Muenster cheese! (One of my faves to put on homemade pizza!)  The first pizza I prepared, all cheese, got stuck to the peel, so once it got onto the pizza steel, it ended up being a calzone instead. Oops! (a delicious accident for sure, haha!)  The second, which had mushrooms, red onion and pepperoni, cooked PERFECTLY.  The final, which was my form of a Hawaiian pizza, got a little stuck to the peel, but not as bad as the first pizza. As a result, it cooked in the shape of a butterfly - it was kinda funky!  The overall experience was delicious - I'm eager to cook this sort of thing again in the future when I have a good amount of time to prepare the dough and cook the pizzas!

When I first started making it I would add a lot of flour, like another cup cause I hated it sticking to my hands but recently I gave the wetter version a go and it makes all the difference, the inside of the finished dough comes out much more moist, soft and chewy as it does not allow for all the moisture to evaporate while it's cooking. It's a lot harder to work with but it's well worth it. I also use the ready to use pizza sauce you buy in glass jars, I have tried with the canned and I feel that the difference is just so minimal I can't even tell. They are both mass produced tomatoes after all so no big surprise honestly, the important thing is to season it well, with lots of oregano, basil, parsley,  and garlic and onion or whatever you make like honestly.

So, could it be possible that the yeast you use from a larger container might have e.g. come into contact with too much air moisture over time and thus might have reacted with that, i.e. started to bloom because of the air moisture and then kinda starved because there was no sugar or other nutrients available?",3년 전,0,

(2) Sargento has a new mozzarella that's now in Kroger (at least where I live, Ohio), that is advertised as whole milk, low moisture. I tried it on this recipe - not good.

The recipe states: ""NOTE: You will probably need to add a lot more flour"" which is the opposite of the video where Adam says ""Add as little flour as possible."" In this case, you'll need an extra 100g - 150g of flour and might as well skip the listed quantities entirely. Just watch the video and use your own judgment.",3년 전,2,

What people call NY style is ""sell by the slice"" stuff made cheaply for drunk people coming out of bars at night. The really good pizza joints in NY all make it different. Sauce: This is not a NY sauce. A NY sauce is essentially tomatoes, period. Personally, I gently cook mine quick with garlic and olive oil, add a pinch of sugar, and a tich of rosemary. Don't ever put oregano in the sauce. Finally, for the LOVE OF GOD do not use cornmeal. Use a mix of flour and semolina.

The hydration % is so important in getting consistent results. After all, this is why we go through the trouble of using the scale to weigh out ingredients instead of doing the whole thing by feel. Leaving the amount of flour (literally the most important ingredient) up to chance is not the best idea - everyone is baking different pizzas. They may be happy with it, but I'll bet most of them aren't baking ""NY Style pizza"", whatever they think it means.",3년 전,2,

@BigSnipp,Here's my tip for making round pizzas. Take a regular 12 inch pizza pan and place a round wax paper sheet on it. Spray with Pam and sprinkle cornmeal on it.  Stretch your dough and lie it on the pan with the wax paper. You can use the round shape of the pizza pan to make your circle. Dress your pizza. Load the pizza onto your peel by gently lifting up the wax paper with a knife. Slide your peel underneath. Now you can easily shimmy your pie onto your pizza stone.,3년 전,0,

@SchnitzelKraft,Not sure what went wrong. Used Typo 00 flour and created a wet batter (instead of a dough) with the quantities in the description (530ml water & 600g flour). I had to add at least 200g (probably more) to make it kneadable. Other recipes use 320ml for 600g.,3년 전,7,
@DouglasRosser,Oh god the water/flour proportions in the video are WAY off. Equal amounts of water and flour is just too much water for beginners. Experienced sourdough bakers tread lightly  near 100% hydration. Adding enough flour to turn this into a dough you can knead (instead of the batter-like consistency you end up with) makes a HUGE batch of dough. I recommend halving the amounts and using 75% of what Adam recommends for water.,3년 전,1,

First one was better.  - It's hard to get the pizza off and into the oven, use loads of flour, 1st pizza was also sticking to steel plate in the oven, the pizza was completely out of shape (but tasty) - used 2 types of graded mozzarella, 45% and 25%, more fat is better  Still have 1 batch of dough left, I'll let it rest for 6 days and try again (minimum 8 minutes, fat cheese, no tomato purée, good layer of flour)",3년 전,1,

You need the extra mass to hold and deliver the heat.  If you go this route keep in mind the steel will have sharp edges and machining oil as well as loose scale you’ll need to season it and address the machine oil and scaling.  It’s worth it though because the steel store enough heat I only cook at 425 Fahrenheit which gives me crisp perfect crust without a ton of smoke.,3년 전,0,

@speedboy6776,"Only thing about this that I really want to critique is the sauce. New York style pizza might be ""cheap"", but that doesn't mean that the ingredients are low quality. The biggest difference I noticed between our pizza in Texas and the pizza in NY is that the pizza in NY has amazing sauce that tastes like tomatoes and not just some weird bland marinara. I never tried the Pastene sauce that Adam uses, but I would recommend that you try blending some of the canned San Marzano tomato's in your local stores first to see which actually tastes the best and like tomatoes. Personally I use that with some tomato paste, a dash of salt, and a pinch of oregano and that's it. My pizza has become way better since I started focusing on the sauce.",3년 전,0,
@panedrop,"Buy the big loaf and cut into usable portions then freeze what you're not going to use before it goes bad. You can do the same thing with the #10 cans of Full Red just use ice cube trays to portion it. A light dusting of flour rubbed onto the peel (board) before putting your dough onto it will, with practice, get your pizza into the oven without corn meal if you prefer not to use the meal.  Just shimmy it a bit to make sure the entire pizza is moving and if you can see a part of it sticking; carefully, gently, lift it up and rub some more flour under that spot with your finger tips. Just don't blow under it... that works well for lazy transfers but means the bottom won't be fully browned.",3년 전,1,

Because if your dough has is somewhat uneven and has thinner spots, the sauce can soak through the dough and cause the dough to stick. This is also why you should assemble your pizza right before you put it in the oven.

@robertwalsh1401,"Ik this comment is from 7 months ago, but I've been attempting this recipe, been having the same issue. Thought i was killing my dough with flour and decided to look at the math of it. If you divide 530 ml of water by 600g of flour, (though 5 cups of flour is actually 625 grams if you google it) youre making an 88% hydration dough which is WAAAY too wet. Neapolitan pizza, which is very wet and hard to work with, is made with around 65% hydration, though adam does also have a video of 75% dough. I think the ""plus more (flour) for working the dough"" in the recipe is, in reality, like an extra 200 grams of flour  AT LEAST, which would be just above 65% hydration. For a decently easy to work dough youre going to be using an extra 2-3 cups of flour. I think He may just not put it all in so he can knead it by hand. If you google ""standler made pizza calculator"" they have a calculator thats pretty easy to use as well. Next batch Im going to use probably around 300-350ml of water with the same recipe in my stand mixer and see how it turns out.",3년 전,1,

I make this almost once a week and I got my containers to store my dough up to a week as the video shows, the longer you leave it in the fridge the better and spongier it gets. I also discovered that to avoid using extra flour what I do is use the exact ingredients, mix it with a spatula for a couple minutes, cover the bowl and walk away for about 10 minutes, I do this twice and the pizza becomes very moldeable. I also use oil in my hands instead of flour when shaping it so that it becomes very crispy on the outside but very soft on the inside. I got the same pizza steel and I’m in love with it. I preheat my oven for an hour at 450 Fahrenheit, and then I bake it on the top rack for 15 minutes if I’m doing 1/4 of the dough, or 20 minutes if I’m doing 1/2 dough.

@moabgram,"Dough report:  Made this dough at 1/3 the size. Followed instructions, except I used instant yeast instead of ""fresh"", and a dark stout beer instead of water. After mixing, I let the dough stand for about 40 minutes. I meant to only do 20, but I got distracted. Initially when kneading, the dough was way too wet to be workable, had to add probably around an entire cup of flour so my hand wouldn't just go straight through it. Kneaded until I could stretch it. Put it in an oil bowl, threw on a lid and into the fridge. After two days I noticed the lid was open, so I closed it firmly and put it back in. After a total of four days, I started the pizzing process.  The dough had not risen, at all. It was just as solid as when I put it in, no bubbles or nothing. This didn't deter me, as that is basically what store bought dough is like. There was a strange goo in the oil, I don't think it was slime mould, but if I get sick and die tomorrow I'll know it was. Gravity stretched it and plopped it on oiled foil (don't have a steel, stone, or corn meal), habanero pizza sauce, store-bought cheese mix, pepperoni, mushroom.  Into oven at 275°c for 7 minutes. Extended to 9 minutes as pepperoni wasn't browning as much as I wanted. This was probably a mistake, layer of oil on cheese and a fairly hard crust. Dough turned out tasty, but fairly dense and chewy. Bottom wasn't exactly soggy, but wetter than I wanted and not crispy. Quite chewy. Crust was dense and a bit hard. Overall a tasty pizza, but not what I was hoping for. Will follow exact recipe next, no beer or instant yeast shenanigans. Over and out.",4년 전,0,

Been looking at those mixers and could get one but don't really have the counter space right now. Additionally, I would like to offer the idea of something less costly. I have a 20 year old Mr. Coffee bread machine and it makes excellent dough. It even has dough proofing built into the cycle which the $350+ mixer does not have.

@Navii-05,"Hello. So, what I want to do with this message is to simply show what the Gospel is.  I am not trying to force my belief down people's throats.  It's your choice whether you want to accept it.  So, a question: Do you think you are a good person?  If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, watched adult material? All of those are sins and anyone who sinned is not good(on God´s standard). You, I and most( most because babies don't sin, and maybe specifically mentally Ill people) purely human beings have violated God's moral law.  Since God is just, He can not let sin go just like that. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve, we deserve to be punished because we have sinned.  The reason why blood must be spilled for forgiveness of sins is because the life of the flesh is in the blood, in the Old Testament Jews sacrificed animals for sins but the  sacrifice of animals were enough to temporarily cover some sins. (it did not allow forgiveness of sins, unlike Jesus´s, it only temporarily covered them)   Jesus is the Lamb of God, the ultimate sacrifice for sins which is enough for all sins that have been done, are done and will be done. He was buried and rose again. His  resurrection proved that His death was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins.Jesus paid our  penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must trust in Jesus's spilled Blood, His finished work on the Cross for our salvation. And then your  sins will be forgiven because of what Christ did, you will be saved.  See: Romans 3:10, Romans 3:23, Romans 5:12, Romans 6:23, Romans 5:8-9, Romans 10:9-10, Ephesians 2:8-9, John 3:16, Leviticus 17:11, Ephesians 1:7, Colossians 1:20,  1 Corinthians 15:1-4. https://youtu.be/lbb4xwYj19g Evidence for God´s existence: Kalam cosmological argument, Contigency argument, Modal ontological argument. Regarding Christianity, check out InspiringPhilosophy´s videos about the Ressurection of Jesus and the reliability of the New Testament. Together, they show good evidence that Christianity is true.-",4년 전,0,

@tomcat2285.,I've been making pizza for years and not until now that i figured out that hotter doesn't always mean browner in the 10-12 minute time frame for the whole pizza. The key I found out after doing some quick research is to par bake the pizza crust for 4 minutes especially with home ovens. 500 to 550 is fine for the toppings but the crust has to be 4 minutes ahead of the toppings in order for it to brown to what you would expect good pizza crust to look like. Stick with the recipe here but i recommend par baking the crust before putting the toppings on.,4년 전,24,

What I don't understand is why all chefs insist on not leaving the pizza in the oven too long, to the point that the orange fat in the cheese oozes out.

I just use it for making pizza dough.  Just dump the wet ingredients in, then the dry ingredients, and set it to dough mode.  It does all the kneading and resting for you on a timer.  It even has a spot where it beeps to add additional ingredients, so you can add the oil later on (if that even matters.)  About an hour later you have a fluffy loaf of pizza dough.  Just turn it out and cut it into portions, stick it in the fridge.  No flour everywhere.  All you have to clean is the measure cups, spoon, and the no-stick pan from the mixer.",4년 전,0,

@taylord50,"The hydration ratio of this dough, as per the video, starts at 100% (and will be cut down somewhat as he adds flour for working the dough). In the video, what he represents as a 100% hydration dough is clearly not a 100% hydration dough.   I just checked out Tony Geminignani's NY recipe and verified that he is running exactly 65% hydration. I would guess that anything north of 70% is going to be so wet as to be difficult for the average home pizzaiolo to transfer from peel to stone.  I think his hydration numbers in the video are out of whack.  In the written recipe, he starts with a hydration ratio of 88%. Still really high. I don't know why not start with 70 and work down from there by adding a bit more flour?

I also prefer to use parchment paper and cook the crust for two minutes before putting on sauce cheese and toppings and then remove the parchment paper.  Much less mess than the cornmeal.  A really good, easy and inexpensive way to make the sauce is by using a can of tomato paste and mixing in one cup of water or other liquid of your choosing and then jazzing it up to your taste.

Quickly zip it up the rest of the way so no air gets in and put it in the freezer.  To reheat, preheat your oven to 400 degrees for ten minutes, place the frozen pizza slices right on the rack and cook at 400 degrees for about ten minutes.

@farrellsheehan3460,Have you ever thought of putting the dough with only sauce in the oven before putting on the cheese? The pizza dough can get crispy beforehand and the sauce acts as a weight so the dough doesn't bubble up but stays flat/crispy. Then take the pizza out and put a little more sauce on(since the sauce in the oven dried out) and then add the cheese. Put it back in the oven and you just have to wait for the cheese to melt.  I find that I get a crispier product in a home oven without worrying about drying out/burning the cheese as you wait for the dough to get crispier in the traditional way.,4년 전,9,

@doubtingthomas6146,Pizza recipe... with a Monty Python reference? I have found my favourite cooking channel.,4년 전,3,
@mushh5203,"If you already have a pizza stone, try this simple modification for 800F temps. The oven temp is irrelevant. The temp of the stone and the air temp and radiation above the stone is what is important. I use a stone because it is specifically designed to have the proper heat conductivity for high temp pizza. (A steel would probably burn the pizza at these temps.) Use the highest rack in your oven for the highest heat. Make sure the top surface of your stone is 2 inches from the red hot broiler elements in your electric oven. (To achieve this 2-inch distance I use an upside-down cookie sheet that has a 1-inch rise at its edges. Your spacing may vary.) (Caution: Whatever spacer you to raise your stone, be sure it can not slide off the oven rack toward you when it is hot) Don't use bake at all. Use the broiler. Set your broiler to its highest temp and keep your oven door at least partly open to preclude the broiler from cycling on and off. You want the broiler to stay on full, and not cycle on and off. Half an hour should be enough to heat your stone to approximately 800F. (Use a non-contact IR thermometer gun to measure stone temp). Depending on how much wet stuff is on your pizza, 800F may be a bit too hot. If you find your pizza bottoms burning before the top is cooked, just pull the rack out and let the stone cool a few degrees (maybe 5 or 10 seconds) before you position your pizza. Then slide stone with pizza back under the hot broiler element. Keep oven door ajar so broiler elements stay on. Start watching your pizza after about 90 seconds and remove it after about 2 minutes, or when the edges have developed the desired char. (some cheese can tolerate this heat, but if your cheese tends to burn, consider protecting the cheese, by topping it with fresh tomato slices.) The pizza bottom should have considerable char making a very tasty crispy bottom that won't droop at the center tip.  I have been making homemade pizza for many years, and have been using this evolved high temp technique for about a year. It makes a spectacular improvement in my pizzas. Cheers!",4년 전,0,

@OxKing,"Having the dough going on room temperature is activating the yeasts and let it do their work. If you put it in the fridge, it is the amylase enzyme of the flour will take over, while the yeast rests and does not multiply. Amylase is breaking the sugar of the dough into smaller chains of molecules, making it easier to digest and alter the taste, what we want.  The yeast is making the bubbles, by also consuming the sugars of the flour. You want them to stop at a certain point, and that's why you put it in the fridge.  But putting the dough directly into it and don't let it even get back to room temperature before baking is almost rendering the yeast useless. Good dough will take time. Not just in the fridge, but in every work step. Another key step is to not give all the flour in the water, but to let the dough rest covered for 15-30 minutes when you just had about 70% of flour in it and it has a consistency between waffle batter and a real pizza dough. After the process mix it a bit, then adding your olive oil and go on with the rest of the flour. That autolysis step will form long molecule chains that will make the dough stronger and better to stretch it without tearing.",4년 전(수정됨),1,

The pizza gets assembled directly on the skillet and after about 7-8 minutes, I have a wonderfully brown, crispy pizza that is just about as good as what you'd get from a quality restaurant. (And tons better than what you'll get from a typical delivery pizza place)  The cast iron is important as it transfers heat more efficiently than the air, allowing the crust to get nice and crispy without burning the toppings. Alternatively, when I was in Venice, the pizza place I went to didn't even put the cheese into the oven. They baked the crust and sauce, and put the mozzarella and basil on afterwards. I have no idea if that's a common thing in that area, but it is a rather practical way of doing it.",4년 전,1,

Therefore, letting an UNvaccinated person on a flight does not in ANY way endanger the public to any greater degree than letting a vaccinated person on a flight.   This is a FRAUD, designed to force you to take a vaccine that has already killed 4,000 people. And why do we NEED a vaccine for a virus that has a 99.9% survival rate in the first place...other than to make Pfizer, Moderna and Anthony Fauci (who has a financial stake in the vaccine) rich. And they want to vaccinate CHILDREN, who are statistically immune to Covid....risking their ability to have children in the future perhaps?  This may be why Bill Gates is trying to force feed us the vaccine. Gates wants to depopulate the planet, and has already said that a vaccine is one way to do this.

@SmallSpoonBrigade,"That's what I do. I found a skillet from lodge that's got very low sides that's great.

Alternatively, you can get dual burner griddles that are flat on top and large enough to fit more than one pizza at a time.

Pretty high quality IMHO.   BTW.....we used just 1 teaspoon of yeast to the flour mixture. I think every yeast package defines the ideal quantity to use based on their observations. I think other conditions can affect that, however.  One other thing......we found that we got better results simply using our electric oven's ""bake"" feature without using the convection.

@hvymettle,"That's a big dough recipe.  Cup of water, 2tsp of yeast, 1 tsp salt, 2.5 to 3 cups of flour is about half that size.  I don't use oil in the dough, it inhibits good hydration of the flour.  If you are going to make your own doughs get a stand mixer, let it knead for 8-10 minutes on a low speed.  Oil a bowl and coat all surfaces of the dough and cover.  If you turn the light on in your oven when you start making the dough, the light warms the oven to the perfect temperature for the dough rise.  Turn off the light 15 minutes after putting the dough in the oven.  About an hour later the dough will have doubled.  When the dough has doubled take it out and punch it down, let it relax for 15 minutes, than work it into a round.  If you don't want soggy pizza, put the dough in a 500 degree oven and let the top brown, about 5 minutes.  Then add your sauce and cheese and put back for another 3-4 minutes.  With a stone, heat the oven by putting it on broil and then switch to bake when you put the pizza in.  You'll get good browning.",4년 전,0,

@sydneybristow5588,Just a little reminder... make sure your oven is cleaned before baking pizza on high temperatures. I failed to clean old residues and the high temperatures caused horrible smoke. I couldn't even bake the pizza before the smoke started which was about 15 mins of preheating the stone. We had to order pizza!!! LoL I was so upset because we were ready for homemade instead of restaurant pizza. I've definitely learned my lesson. I hope this tip helps anyone before the same mistake is made.,4년 전,721,
@SmallSpoonBrigade,"I personally just smoosh mine against my dinner plate until it's roughly the same size as the cast iron skillet that it's going to be baked in. Then I take it out and hold it vertically and work it around before putting it back on the plate and stretch it some more. Sure, you can hand stretch it the way that they do in the movies and TV, but if you're not making a larger pizza, that can be problematic as that requires a relatively large area to work with.  The dough winds up being even and the right size before I throw it into the preheated skillet for a trip into the oven.",4년 전,0,

When I make sourdough bread I do like 78% hydration and even that is very difficult to work with your hands. Both times I have made this pizza recipe I have had to add so much flour that I’m sure the ratio of the other ingredients ends up out of proportion.

@alnoso,"most fast-food places (domino's is basically fast food) have food with a deceptively high amount of calories. for example, there's McDonald's. if you know their Big Tasty, it's a permanent product in some places, seasonal in others, that fucking sandwich has around 800 calories. a big mac has around 550 (still a lot for a burger like that, honestly just skip the middle bun if you're gonna eat one anyway). I've eaten both, anyway. do I feel fuller from the big tasty? fuck no, i feel like I've eaten just as much with both. in my country there's this pretty plain chicken sandwich there which has like 350 calories and fuck i feel just as full from that as from a big tasty. and it's almost a third of the calories. you can eat two quarter pounders instead of a big tasty and that'll feel like so much more fucking food. it's those fucking sauces I'm telling ya, they're just empty calories. no idea how they got a sauce that heavy and calorie dense to not feel like you're eating mayo straight out of the jar with a spoon, cuz honestly that'd achieve the same purpose, just way more disgusting. probably mayo emulsified with water and added sugar dissolved in that water, absolutely no idea honestly.  if i eat a homemade burger that's 800 calories my body just gives up after i force it to eat that much. meanwhile, mcdonalds doesn't even phase it as i chow down on a 800 calorie big tasty. magic, i swear. as far as i know, that sandwich has to be one of the most calorie rich serving sizes of any food. there's these disgusting literal pure fat biscuits bound with a little flour to make them chewable enough for your body to register them as food, literally made to have as many calories as possible, and those have fewer calories per ""serving"" than the big tasty.",4년 전,3,

@brettvanderbrook," @showusyabits  Yeah, that’s 60% hydration which seems pretty standard for pizza dough. I think you could go a little wetter to get a lighter texture like Adam mentions, but I think 100% hydration is just unworkable as pizza dough.",4년 전(수정됨),3,
@gabrielmgbr,"You're right, Brett! His dough seems to be 60% hydration... That was the first thing I thought when I read the recip description!",4년 전,1,
@paulybmrof,"It’s 2 1/4 cup water to 5 cup flour, he also Adds more flours through out. That’s not 100% hydration. Almost all NY pizza uses 2 1/4 cup water and 5 cup flour",4년 전,1,
@brettvanderbrook," @paulybmrof  It is, though, assuming the weight values he put in the video are correct. You divide the weight of the flour by the weight of the water to get hydration percentage. His video said 600ml of water (so 600 g) and 600g of flour. That is 100% hydration. Opinions vary but most NY pizza dough recipes keep hydration in the 65-70% range. I’ve tried Adam’s recipe twice now as written and the dough is an unworkable mess, even if I add a ton of extra flour. If I reduce the water to just less than 400ml to bring it to that 65-70% hydration level it becomes much, much easier to deal with.",4년 전,6,
@paulybmrof," @brettvanderbrook  the weight values in the description say 530 ml water to 600 flour. That’s 88% and then he adds more flour to that “until it’s workable”, which could mean adding another cup or more. Assuming it’s another cup that’s 120 g, hydration would be about 73%.",4년 전,4,
@brettvanderbrook," @paulybmrof  then he changed it for the description because the text in the video says 600 for both. But also if you’re having to add up to another 120g of flour after the dough has been formed, your recipe doesn’t have enough flour to begin with. Quoting Richard Eaglespoon, who wrote one of the best deep-dives on making pizza at home: “If the dough ends up being too sticky after it’s all together, do not add bench flour. Do not add bench flour. Bench flour perturbs the recipe, and it’s a short-term solution that masks the actual reason why a dough is still sticky. If you truly need more flour (that’s a big if), then you should adjust the original recipe rather than compensate haphazardly and dilute the concentration of every other ingredient.” I use the dough calculator from that article and I get pitch perfect dough every time. His hydration is even lower, because he’s of the opinion that too many modern recipes are overly hydrated. It’s worth a read if you’ve got an hour or so to kill. It’s extremely technical and nerdy, and a little snooty in parts, but this guys has absolutely done his homework: https://www.richardeaglespoon.com/articles/how-to-pizza/?fbclid=IwAR1HLVew9kU5aT4fJ4dTuUrAWgYkARP5lL-cSPlI0sQhDkU2G0xkWHOHEQ0.

@link_7164,"Thanks for the article, I’m looking forward to reading it. The dough calculator says 856 grams of flour would be needed for this amount of water. In Adam’s defence, he does say to add more flour both in the video and the written description. Although the written version lets you know it’s going to be a lot of flour. I also don’t think the other ingredients are necessarily diluted by this. He knows he is going to add more and has sized the other ingredients accordingly. Some are even more than the dough calculator says. On the other hand, I do wish he’d given the total amount of flour so it could be used as a baseline for those who can’t or don’t want to judge hydration (Adam believes it’s possible to get it close enough by eye with practice).",3년 전,0,

I remember going out to Hermosa beach in California in the late 1970's. California is mostly people from out of state and people were longing for pizza like they got back east. Wise potato chips were being smuggled in and in return, people were smuggling Coors and Olympia beer back to New York.   Fun days.  Anyway, word got around quickly that good pizza was needed and one by one many a great Italian chef left the Big Apple and they packed up their things and moved to Beverly...Hills that is.  The early bird chefs made a fortune and retired out west and within 20 years, great Italian joints in New York were decimated.  There's only a couple left in Manhattan now and if it wasn't for a resurgence in Brooklyn, there would be no such thing as pizza in New York.

Yours is a little more water and a little more sugar than I use, but I also add honey, which improves the browning.  You should try either substituting or adding some.  I agree that it does not seem to add any sweetness to the dough.  The part about the salt is adding BEFORE the yeast get started.  I have also not seen it have an adverse effect, but I now add about 5-10 minutes after kneading the dough and I get great results.  Lastly, I think olive oil also adds to the pliability of the dough and always add it.  In my experience, it makes the dough much more easy to handle and stretch in the end.  I also infuse my olive oil with basil and oregano for a little more pep.  Not sure if it all gets cooked out, but seems to heighten the flavor.  LOVE YOUR VIDEO!!!",4년 전,1,

@siennacrosby1778,"Alright so I just finished eating the pizzas, and here's my honest review/tips.  Quick version: If you're making this pizza, I recommend to maybe double the batch of dough so each ball of dough could be bigger, meaning bigger pizzas. Mine came out TINY and I was able to just get 4 slices out of EACH pizza itself. There were 4 people, meaning 1 slice per person on each pizza, which isn't filling at all. Make sure to put the dough in containers that are sealable, and to add a lot of olive oil so your dough doesn't dry out... like the top of mine did. The fridge method personally didn't work for me (even when I turned the temperature of the fridge up), and I had to take the dough out of the fridge in the morning, so the dough could unfreeze and rise before dinner.  Overall, I'd give it a 7.5/10 for the process of making the dough, sauce, taste of the pizza was AMAZING .  The rising process a 2/10.. It did not work in the fridge.  Long and detailed version plus tips: Making the actual pizza dough was very quick and simple. Kneading the dough only took about 10 minutes, and I did every step by hand.  A few hours went by of the dough sitting in the fridge, and I just kept on checking on them (2 of the 4 were in a clear container), but I saw absolutely no change. I opened the container and touched the dough, and noticed that a hard shell had covered the top of the dough and the bottom of it was very soft and spongy.. So I just figured that the hard layer on the top restricted the spongy bottom bit of the dough from rising. So I turned up the temperature of the fridge and went to bed. When I woke up (9+ hours after), I still saw little to no change. It probably just expanded a bit, but didn't rise. So I decided to take all the dough out of the fridge and left them on the counter until dinner. After leaving them in warm temperatures, the dough finally came alive and expanded a bit (some of the dough expanded/rose more than others), so I did the final steps and put them in the oven on a heated up upside down baking sheet (I don't have a pizza stone). They took about 10-ish minutes to cook and came out perfectly! The pizza browned veryyy well and it was FULL of flavour, unlike some other recipes I've used. The taste of the dough actually tasted like pizza dough too! The dough on another pizza recipe I've used tasted more like bread, and didn't give that enjoyable crust experience you'd have with a pizza you bought. But the only problem is that they're TINY. And I mean TINY. I was able to get 4 pieces for each pizza... which if you're eating with four people like I was, that means each person gets one small piece.. per pizza. Which isn't filling at all. So I had to make the entire batch so that each person AT LEAST could have more than one piece. Honestly, the rising process could've been affected because I put 2 balls of dough in a bowl (rather than container), and stuck a cloth on top, so it wasn't very air tight. But I DID put 2 of the other balls of dough in a container, like he said. I would say that the ones in the shut-closed container rose better, but still, they just barely rose. If you're doing this recipe, I'd just tell you to do the normal warm rising process instead of the long and cold one, and just make the pizza 2 and a half hours before dinner.",4년 전,18,

My process/tools are similar and I have suggestions if you want to try, I'd love your take. 1) you mentioned the cheese separating - I've had better luck by adding my old pizza stone to the top rack, skip a rack and then put in baking steel on third rack. I've found that the cheese doesn't separate in this ""little oven"" and I can move the mostly cooked pizza to the top stone for some last minute color if needed. 2) I use both flour and corn meal on the peal. I put both in separate recycled glass spice shakers to help give an even distribution. 3) After the rack cooling step, I take a vegetable scrubber (tough brush) and brush the bottom of the cooked dough to remove extra flour/corn meal.

@AFoley-ru2zp,"I made this dough and then, following the advice of an Italian pizzaiuolo, let it rise in a warm environment outside of the fridge for 24 hrs., which ruined it. I suspect because in this recipe there's a bunch of sugar (for browning), and in the pizzaiuolo's recipe there is no sugar (because he uses a wood-stove oven and needs no browning). -- I want to make this again, the way you say to (letting it rise in the fridge), but was curious about the oven requirements. I just ordered the same iron insert that you recommend in the video. However, my oven is gas, and so it turns on and off intermittently and does not maintain a constant temperature. I set a pan full of water in, turned the stove to 400F and after 30 min. the temperature of the water was around 179F. I don't imagine that after an hour it would be much higher. -- I live in NYC and asked three different pizzerias in my area how hot their ovens are and was surprised that they were not nearly as hot as I expected: one said 600-something (that's what I expected), another 500, and another 400!! And they all produce great results. How can you mitigate the fluctuating temperature of a gas oven and does it need to be as hot as possible?",4년 전,0,

@thechosen5768,"After death, where will you spend eternity? Heaven or Hell? If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.  Hell is a place of torment forever...continuous burning by fire. The fire is never quenched, with crying and weeping forever (Mark 9:43-48; Psalm 9:17; Mathew 25:41). It was originally prepared for satan and his demons, but anybody that obeys the devil in committing sin and refuse to repent and accept Jesus Christ, if the person dies in sins, he or she will be thrown into Hell. You still have the opportunity to repent now, amend your ways, live and spend eternity in heaven. Go to www.tlccrm.org  You may be asking; how do I stop all these sins? Simply take the first step of repentance and have inner hatred for those sins, then ask Jesus to forgive you and come into your life to be your Lord and personal Saviour. In John 1:12, there is power that will be given to you, and in Mathew 11:28, if you receive Jesus into your life, He will deliver you and give you victory over those sins; then you will need to cut off from the source of those sins in your life (may be sinful friends; stop the evil relationship.  This gospel is not to condemn you, but for you to be convicted so that you will repent and give your life to Jesus Christ who loves you and really wants you to make it to heaven at the end of your life here on earth",4년 전,0,

,"I can't believe how well this turned out, even though i had to modify methods out of necessity. I don't have a pizza steel or stone so I heated up an upside down cookie sheet. Since I don't have a paddle, I rolled out the dough onto a square of parchment paper and put this on top of the hot cookie sheet. For sauce I blended some Muir Glen organic tomatoes with half a can of tomato paste, oil and a sprinkling of dry oregano. Despite all my workarounds, this was remarkably like parlor pizza.  The crust was damn near perfect in both taste and texture. Will definitely do this again.Thanks!",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@groundlooper,"Fantastic video.  For those looking to make pizza at home this is simply a great place to start. Five stars!!!  The one thing that didn't work for me was the gravity method for stretching the pizza.  I think it takes a feel for the dough.  I looked up pizza stretching and found that the more traditional method worked a lot better.  I stretched the dough to just before one would normally toss it. I found that it made almost the perfect size to fit on the pizza sheet.  Steel sheets are definitely the way to go.  I had a ceramic stone which was OK but ended up cracking down the middle after a few pies.  While a bit spendy, the sheets work so much better.  Be careful not to drop one on a foot. These things are heavy.  What I absolutely love love love about this is I can make a high quality pizza at home and make it much healthier than I can find at most pizza joints with absolute control over the ingredients. I've started substituting in a cup of whole wheat flour. That's been working well. I dropped the salt from 1tbsp to 1tsp. Not a fan of onions... or more accurately, onions aren't a fan of me.  I can leave out onions altogether from sauce or toppings. Didn't have a can of crushed tomatoes on the last batch so I made my own from a can of whole tomatoes.  I ended up cooking it down to make a thicker sauce.  The experts may say cooking can take away the flavors. That may be true but my palette isn't refined enough, yet, to pick up the difference. The point is, there are options and even if you can't find the ideal ingredients, such as true whole milk low moisture mozzarella, it's still going to be a pretty darned good pizza. Of course, fresh, quality ingredients are better when you can find them.",4년 전,0,

@DaigoroTheExploro,Made some dough from a random recipe thats identical to this one. But after using 1.5 tablespoons of active dry yeast and my dough rising to no end I assumed this was a mistake. Now this video has me lost. I know there's a difference in instant yeast and active dry yeats amounts. But wtf is correct Active Dry Yeast ammount?? This video a year old and he hasn't corrected this or commented?? I just ate 2 pizzas and now I can't get this yeast taste out of my mouth,4년 전,2,
@DaigoroTheExploro, @brunovaz  apparently 2 1/4 teaspoon of dry yeast is equivalent to .25 ounce. So 7 grams . 1 tsp would be little over 3 grams which is closer to 2 than 9,4년 전,0,
@brunovaz," @DaigoroTheExploro  Yeah. But I was looking at the dry yeast's package and it says ""10g for 1kg of flour"". My conclusion that it doesn't really matter how much you use, the worst that will happen is wasting more dry yeast than you had to.",4년 전,0,
@DaigoroTheExploro, @brunovaz  oh it definitely matters. Read my first comment just a couple up. I wasn't joking. I still taste yeast. I was agreeing with you and after looking at many recipes it is definitely teaspoon not tablespoon. A little bit more wouldn't matter but a lot is awful. Does not stop rising and tastes like toe jam,4년 전,0,
@brunovaz," @DaigoroTheExploro  So I must've used a different type of yeast? Does tour yeast has any amount recommend on the label? I've baked a couple of pizzas with this amount of yeast (10g for 700g of flour) and they tasted fine, didn't rise more than I expected",4년 전,0,
@DaigoroTheExploro," @brunovaz  I used Fleishmans active dry yeast. Like I said I know there's a difference between instant and active, and obviously fresh. But not sure if that changes amounts. I know active has to be activated in the water first before mixing where as instant can go right in the flour. The recipe I made was almost identical but I had even more yeast so maybe I'm just past the taste threshold. Mine called for 1.5 tbsp. And like I've said all the recipes I looked at with similar batch size are all teaspoon. You can even see in the video when he adds is definitely teaspoon amount.",4년 전,0,
@brunovaz," @DaigoroTheExploro  I have no idea, then. I'm using Fleischman's instant dry yeast and the package says ""20g for 1kg of flour for pizzas, 10g for breads"". So even more than a tablespoon. I don't live in the US so maybe it's somehow different there Next time I'll try to use a teaspoon and cold rise",4년 전,0,
@DaigoroTheExploro, @brunovaz  lol yeah mine just says how to check if yeast is active and the 2 1/4 tsp = .25 ounce.,4년 전,0,
@DaigoroTheExploro, @brunovaz  from what I've researched too much yeast can result in awful yeast taste like I ended up with but it isn't the only factor. Too much sugar can also cause this. Also rising times for specific recipes can effect taste. Ultimately 3 factors revolve around the yeast. Too much yeast is bad. Too much sugar is bad. To long of rise is bad. The three are equally important. So you are right in that a bit more yeast might not effect depending your rise time and sugar. But too much is Definitely not good,4년 전,2,

@mtoplikar,"Ok, I think I am pretty close to perfection but I'm running into a few problems and could use a little coaching if possible.  I've tried this twice now and have had the same experience twice.  I will start off by saying that I live in Albuquerque, New Mexico, so I am at high elevation and dry climate (I've read that can make a difference with baking).    The first problem I'm having is that my dough seems to be too springy and not stretchy enough.  It tastes great, but I'm not able to stretch it out as wide as you have done in the videos.  Once I get it down on the pizza peel it contracts, so I end up with a smaller and thicker crust that is hard to get into a good shape.  Do you think I need to add more oil or water?  Should I knead it longer at the beginning (I have been going for about 15-20 minutes)?  Secondly, I'm having problems with sliding the pizza off the peel and into the oven.  When I put down a decent amount of cornmeal, it slides off ok, but I have to put down A LOT of it, and the cornmeal makes it's way onto the pizza steel and causes my whole kitchen to smoke up during cooking. I've been using medium grind cornmeal and was wondering what you use.  If you have any tips or tricks, I'd be much appreciative.",4년 전,0,

@JosephKeenanisme,"You don't need a mixer or bread maker, but they sure save on your hands if your wrists and hands are all messed up....  I use my bread makers for mixing the dough not for baking. It's also a good way to ""fire and go"" (have the dough mixing & cycling) when prepping your sauce and other stuff. Have the bread machine start mixing, start your sauce to a low simmer, ect so by the time the sauce is ready for the dough it's t a reasonable temp.  If you fry up sausage or bacon it's also a good way to have all that chilled down to room-ish temp as well.  Also garlic kills yeast so if you want to do something like sprinkle garlic on the crust do it after the dough is made, not by adding garlic powder (I did that enough when I first started making breads and ruined enough stuff).  Use what you have at hand, or try a thrift store for a bread maker if you want to go cheap (Where I got my second one).",5년 전,0,

In your video, one can see that you left leftover flour on the sides of the stainless steel bowl.  That is waste, and a severe disrespect to food.

@wesamshaarawi3773,"Huge improvement over the first video which had some beginner mistakes imo. Don't understand the continued aversion to using a scale because the flour measurements are still way off. I know King Arthur lists that flour as 120g per cup on their website, but that is the sifted weight. I use the same bread flour and if you just scoop a cup out of the bag it is around 160g, meaning 5 cups weighs about 800g. That makes a lot of sense because the dough in this video looks closer to a 70-75% hydration (600g water ÷ 800g flour) rather than 100% hydration (600g water ÷ 600g flour) which would be very wet, sticky and difficult to knead.  To any beginners reading this, don't be stubborn and just buy a scale it will be a huge help in improving your pizza and bread making. A good one cost only $15 and your pizza will be more consistent since you'll know how much flour and water you're using each time. It's also faster since you can just pour flour into the bowl until you reach 800g instead of trying to scoop 5 perfect cups.",5년 전,0,

@HenriqueYurui,"Hi. So, I made a pizza yesterday and had the same surprise as you. I watched the video again and realized that when he is talking about the amount of flour, Adam says that he will use 600g of flour, but that this amount is just a ""starting point"" and that more flour will be added as the dough asks for .   From the experience I had, the less flour you put (beyond 600g) the better the dough is, which in my case was almost 1kg of flour.   Note: This may also have happened because of the type of flour you used.",5년 전,0,
@verdtre4573," @HenriqueYurui  I used the german Type 550 flour. Thing is with 600g its almost liquid, which seems weird to me, but he did say he was inaccurate. Im not sure what i did wrong in the end, probably added too much flour, but the pizza i made came out more deep-dish than New York style, even though i stretched it pretty thin.

@HenriqueYurui," @verdtre4573  Well, I used a flour that would be equivalent to cake flour, because the place I live does not have a flour like the one in the video.   But really, with only 600g of flour the dough looks more like a cake mix and it becomes impossible to knead. I used a covencional gas oven, I never tried to make pizza in a pan, but I think it is not impossible.

@verdtre4573," @HenriqueYurui  I just tried to fry the dough like Ragusea did in his extra dough video, came out much more compact and browned very differently. I really think the problem is the flour type. Pizza dough seems to depend a lot on very high gluten, 12-14% or something. I dont think cake flour would work at all. Neither does my 550 apparently. I saw another type thats just called ""pizza flour"", which i assume is supposed to be similar to the specific italian 00 flour meant for pizza (apparently there are different 00 types).

As I said, I mixed an italian floor (type ""00"") + wheat semolina (my ratio was 4:1). The grain is finer with this flour, If you want a thin dough it's the way to go. Regular canadian flour is good too but your dough will be thicker. I had to add some flour because it was too wet and sticky (again, it's not the same flour, the recipe need to be ajusted).

@qveenissac,"A trick to stretching the dough is to use your knuckles -- make your hand into a claw w/ your fingers together and having one hand under each end of dough, stretch it and work your way around the dough stretching your circle or oval. I worked at an Italian restaurant that specialized in personal up to 23"" NY pizzas that was one of the tricks the cooks used. That's also how they tossed them up if they were being fancy (it's not caught on the fingertips but the knuckles as the latter doesn't poke holes on the catch). The pizzas were very thin with thick crusts which is my fave kind. If you also like a loaf of bread around your pie leave the rim thicker otherwise stretch the surface evenly.",5년 전,2,

@JesusSavesFromSin,"Romans 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Hebrews 9:27  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: Isaiah 64:6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. Revelation 21:8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. Romans 5:8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. John 3:16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. Romans 10:9-10.  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. John 5:24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. 1John 5: 10-13 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. Ephesians 2:8-9  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Romans 8:1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 1 Corinthians 15:3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 2 Corinthians 5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. ...................................",5년 전,1,

@ronbron5844,"a bit nitpicky but just for improvement:  start with fewer water instead of flour. it's about creating consistent gluten structure and by adding flour later in the kneadingprocess, there is a higher chance for underdeveloped gluten. German Bakers call the dough ""bockig"" when its underdeveloped (which can happen when you add extra wheat flower in the process). It also kinda helps a bit developing gluten with a bit dryer dough. The dough is always sticky at the beginning and is going to be less sticky the more gluten it develops. So if the hands get sticky, just keep on kneading! You can always introduce more water in small badges in the kneading process. The french also got an own word for it called ""Bassinage"". They do it to incorparate more water in the dough to get a higher hydration. You can do it til you got your desired 'dough feel' when you aren't working with precise measurements.",5년 전,1,

The amount of extra flour to add beyond the 600 g isn't stated in the video, but also no real ""feel"" is given. I thought it would only be a little bit more but just the starting 600g for me created a sopping porridge. In the description you hint that it's a lot more flour than 600g. I was thinking ""what... 700g has got to be enough flour for this recipe"". I used up the rest of my flour (I think it was significantly more than 800g total, but I can't be sure). Well, my dough is much wetter than yours still but at least it's not sticking mercilessly anymore, but I'm not confident that it'll hold up the way yours did for the rest of the process.

@szymonantoniak1772,"My problem exactly - soppy porridge. I've tried this recipe before and my process was the same as yours, so I thought maybe i messed up the proportions. Absolutely not the case this time, I'm in the middle of making it and there's no way my dough will start looking like Adam's unless I add at least 200g more flour. I'm in Europe and the types of wheat grown here are different (soft wheat types as opposed to hard whear) - maybe that's the source of our problems? Anyway, people claim you need to just keep kneading, but they disregard the fact that the final pizza must be not sticky enough to slide off the peel - impossible without adding much much more flour.",5년 전,2,
@jpaxonreyes," @szymonantoniak1772  - I was able to make pizzas, AND the crusts did taste good (although I added a little sourdough discard for additional flavor). To get it to work, I found that the chilled dough needs to drop directly into a container with a lot of flour covering the whole of the bottom. Then I flipped the dough over to cover the other side. Only then would my wet dough be somewhat workable. (I don't think I could have used too much flour.) Being really careful since it couldn't support it's full weight, I dredged the dough through the flour while trying to do gravity stretches.  I couldn't stretch this dough as thinly as I wanted and learned that baking as hot as Adam recommended was TOO hot for crusts thicker than his. The thicker crusts came out undercooked inside but burnt outside. I had to lower the temperature a bit to solve that problem.",5년 전,0,

The top cooked but the base was semi raw. Another fail. Today I made the dough, cooked it in the oven for about 8 mins then put on the toppings and cooked again. Not perfect but pretty good.

@VividBoi,"My personal experience: 1. I personally have noticed that the wet dough bakes WAY to fast at 450 F°. The bottom gets so hard that when you try to fold it, it snaps in half like a cracker. (I think the pizza steel is also too conductive believe it or not, so I think I cant leave the steel in as it preheats)  2.Additionally, a nice Italian man at a pizza shop showed me his pizza making process when I mentioned, that I make pizza. His method differs from yours as in, he mentions that he only does warm rises. Something about it's more ""thorough"" that way, and it's less ""dense"". Apperntly its easier on the digestive system and just comes out fluffier.  3.Lastly, just something interesting, his cheese was bull milk mozzarella. Which I mentioned i never heard of. He said bull milk chesse is more smooth, and that most mozzarella is bull's milk, they just dont really advertise it that way. The cheese was also pre grated in the bag, which you specifically mentioned is bad, but for some reason it worked for them. They are also buying super high quality cheese of course, so maybe it dosnt have the same disadvantages as store bought grated mozzarella.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@gooseisloose4015,"This is a great recipe and I love it, but here are a few things that made it a lot easier for us to make this (we did 2 his method and did 2 this method):   1. We used a rolling pin. It still turned out awesome!  2. We didn't really want to get it to 500 degrees Fahrenheit or above (we were afraid of burning our house down after the first time we got it to 500 degrees, we're clumsy), we kept it at 425, and just like the video said, warmed up the steel in the preheating oven.   3. WE PRE-BAKE THE DOUGH. This was soo helpful and caused a lot less stress. It was incredibly difficult to get the dough on to the steel after all the sauce, cheese, and toppings had been put on, simply because we didn't have a pizza peel or cardboard or anything big and flat that wasn't plastic.                    - We pre-baked just the dough for about 5 -7 mins at around 310 degrees Fahrenheit                        (while the oven was still preheating).   4. When we didn't do the pre-baking,  the top was getting overdone and the bottom was still undercooked. When we pre-baked, we got a really nice crunch and color.

I suggest that you let it cool down after kneading for about 30mins then shape your dough into balls. After shaping, put it in a container, brush it with oil to avoid drying and then put it in your fridge WITHOUT the lid for about an hour. Check your dough temperature just by touching it with your hands and when it is already cold, you can now put the lid on. Let it cold ferment for 24-72 hours. Take it out of your fridge and let it come to room temperature for at least 90 mins and you can now make your pizza. I hope this will help you Adam and everybody here. :)",5년 전,0,

The one step where you can run into a disaster is transferring from the peel to the stone/steel. After too many prior catastrophes, I now form the pizza on a pan, set the pan on the stones for about 2-4 minutes and then slide the pizza shell which is now just stiff enough to hold its shape, on to the stone/steel. Another trick is give the dough a bit of head start before adding toppings and finish off with a minute or two under the broiler to crisp the edges of cup and curl pepperoni.",5년 전,0,

@briancorrigan5350,"7 years ago.  Brand new gas oven.  Step one:  Clip the thin sheetmetal self cleaning lock arm clean off, Step two: loosen the screw that mounts the door open sensor and secure the pin in a depressed position with a thin washer secured by the screw.  Turn on Self Cleaning.  Wait until stone is up in the 700+ range (30 to 40 minutes).  I use an instant read laser temperature thingie...$20 from Harbor Freight. Open door and use a super peel ( a peel with a pastry cloth conveyor belt) and slide pizza neatly on stone.  One minute, rotate pizza front to back.  If the bottom cooks faster than the top, remove it to a cooling rack and then put the rack and pizza right back in the oven.  This way, you get the char on the bottom and can get the top how you like it without burning the bottom.  Is it worth the trouble?  Only if you spent the first 40 years of life in NYC then moved to the West Coast.  They do things to pizza here.  Bad, bad, dirty things.  Pineapple things.

@illuvattar,"I just tried to make these pizzas exactly according to the recipe in your description, but my main problem was with the dough. After about 80hrs in the fridge in separate containers, they looked nothing like yours. I made 2 doughballs; 1 was very stretchy and sticky when I put it on the peel and made for a very thin pizza which was nearly impossible to get of the peel (I had to get it of in separate pieces). The other doughball was the opposite; it was very thick and almost didn't stretch out with the gravity method, so it took a lot of extra kneading to get it into shape. Out of precaution, I put some baking paper beneath it to get it easily onto my pizzasteel. Then after a minute, I pulled away the paper.  So the main problem was with my dough. Any idea what I could have done wrong? I pretty much followed exactly what you did.",5년 전,3,
@kevintran6336,"If the dough is sticky, could mean that you didn’t oil the dough enough when you put it in the fridge. My dough was oiled up and didn’t stick at all. You also want to add enough extra flour during the dough making process. 5 cups of flour is almost certainly not enough. He says to add more until the dough is workable. With the second dough ball, it could be that your yeast was dead so it didn’t have any air(so it was thick) or that you overworked the dough.",5년 전,1,
@illuvattar,"@Kevin Tran Thanks for answering. I added quite a lot of oil in the container. The problem with this recipe is that the hydration percentage is way way too high, almost 90%. It makes the dough unworkable and hard to get off the pizza peel. After some more research, NY Pizza usually seems to have a hydration percentage of about 60-65%. I used that recently and it was so much better. You hardly need any extra flour, and creating doughballs and shaping the balls to pizzas is so much easier. I have no idea how Adam makes this workable with an hydration of 88% or so. He must add quite a bit of flour while kneading. So my advice for novices: start with a hydration percentage of about 60%, and then work your way up, slowly. This means that for 100g of flour, you use 60g of water.",5년 전(수정됨),2,
@kevintran6336,"DartSidious505 I added nearly an entire cup of flour before it was workable for me. So, I imagine Adam also added a significant amount of flour. 5 cups is just a baseline and he slowly works up from there to maximize hydration for a crispy crust. Good luck!",5년 전,0,

Was a totally disaster. Seriously, I barely were able to eat that. The other that I made today was way better, but still not even close to the Adam's dough. I think the problem was the flour and the metric system. Here in Brazil we use metric system and I think Adam's recipe works better in imperial system because I used 600ml of water and this was toooo much water, I just ended using about 1kg of flour.

@Out_Of_Mana,"Pizza is perhaps the single food/dish I have consumed the most of any singular kind. That said, I think  ""NY Style Pizza"" is an acquired taste. If you grow up eating pizza in that style, it is far more the case you think it is very good. Due to the density of the East Coast United States, this leads to a kind of proliferation of the NY Style Pizza being rather commonly consumed & thought of as a 'ideal pizza' of sorts. Marketing, television, and the internet only furthered this idea with a lot of marketing and news outfits also being primarily East Coast-based.  Over the years, I have tried pizza in many places around the world. In my opinion, NY Style Pizza is at best overrated and worst, the worst. I can't stomach the greasy layer and floppiness.

@ScottA2345,"I cook mine at 525 and use a stone - I get a crispy crust with the leopard spots.  Maybe b/c I use a high gluten bread flour (King Kaiser or All Trumps).  If you are really into pizza it is REALLY worth getting  a high gluten bread flour (great for bread making too).  I also use fresh mozz to start (about one half of a 4-5 oz ball) - then use a mix of shredded whole milk mozz with provolone (3 parts mozz and 1 part provolone).  My pizzas are never wet from the cheese.  I use parchment paper instead of corn meal - far easier and less mess.  Pizza and paper glide on and off peel and stone - never have to worry about having the pizza sit too long on the peel and sticking to it.  There is one trick to using your home oven.  As the video says - heat the stone for a good hour.  But right before you are going to cook the pizza, turn off the oven, and then turn it on again set to your max temp. Mine is 525.  The reason for this is most ovens will cycle - so they actually do not keep a constant temp.  By turning it off and immediately turning it on again set to 525, the stove will preheat and bring it back up to 525 at the very moment you want to start cooking your pizza.  At the end (usually 7 minutes), if my outer crust doesn't have enough browning with a couple of black spots, I throw on the broiler which gets the top element up to 550 - and then I watch carefully for the perfect browning - usually less than a minute.",5년 전,0,

@hayzet,Here are 2 tricks 1- I switch on only the broiler in my gas oven with the pizza stone in. Get the oven to temperature along with the pizza stone for 1 hour at least. This way you get bottom and top even Browning along with a real pizza oven look. 2- shred your cheese and freeze it over night. This slows down the melting and avoid the possible breakdown and burning of cheese 3- add the olive oil on top of the finished pizza before you place it in the oven instead of mixing with the dough. Plus you already added a bit of it in the bowl during the proofing process. I just wanted to share my own experience  But seriously Adam.... I love your videos,5년 전(수정됨),0,
@n40tom,His water ratio in this recipe is wrong. The hydration  he stated here  is almost one the one .  That is way too high  as other people have noted . The hydration of New York pizza dough is about 62% actually 60 to 65 .  I used 62 .5 .  So if you are using 600 grams of flour you will need 375 grams of water for the proper ratio. Yes it's easier and more exact to weigh everything. A kitchen scale is only about 10 bucks on Amazon and it's a great tool for baking and for Pizza dough also. Okay good luck I got to run the grandkids are on their way and they always want pizza at my house.,5년 전,2,

Of the hundreds of pizza dough videos on YT, you’re just about the only one to address “delayed oil addition”, an approach advocated by many experts such as Tom Lehmann. I do it but you see no big difference. Interesting. Can I ask what is your hydration rate in this video? 600g water to 600g flour is 100% hydration. Unless I missed something, I doubt that you like your doughs this wet! Also, I get too much smoke in the kitchen with flour or semolina on the paddle. I use the lazy/amateurish but good old parchment paper. I remove it 2-3 minutes into the bake; no smoke alarms coming on! Anyhow, good job, keep it up.",5년 전,0,

@waitingforcivictyper,I strong suggest not to follow the flour-water ratio mentioned in the ingredient list - it is a 88% hydration ratio and it is a soggy mess. Stick to the 65-70% hydration that is standard for most pizza doughs. I think its a typo - he probably meant to write 350ml of water.  I had to add so much more flour to my dough to get it working again. My brain was in autopilot and I didnt notice the extremely abnormal hydration ration mentioned here.

I Gravity stretched the dough and placed it upon the foil in the center.   There was 4"" of foil left over on left & right side. Working quickly, I added the sauce, spinach and pepperoni with whole milk mozzarella and a sprinkled dusting of good Parmesan cheese.    Caution:: Be very careful with the next step for you must grab the foil on left and right side and lift it off your working surface and place the pie onto the hot stone.  Note:: do not use the foil as a peel and dump it onto hot pizza stone.  You will place the foil containing the uncooked pizza right onto the center of the hot pizza stone.   Clear your path of obstructions and open oven door.  With potholders slide out your oven rack about 8”.  Now gently lift the foil from your working surface ... preferably your stovetop, onto the hot pizza stone.

@scumfungus,"Hey, So i recently tried to follow this recipe and this comment goes out to all other home cooks who are gonna follow this but are stopping themselves because of lack of ingredients and tools.  First of all I am just a student in india, I didn't have most of the equipment or ingredients but I tried.  For the dough, I kneaded it for 1 hour straight because it just kept tearing up. Later I learnt that you sometimes need to let the dough relax and the glutens to firm up and build bonds. Follow what Adam says, make sure your water is in there first and add dough little by little.  I don't have an oven. My microwave has a convection oven setting which surprisingly worked very well. I replaced the pizza steel used in this video with an aluminum plate like structure which I preheated with the over. I seared my stretched out dough on a pan for a while before shifting it on to the aluminum plate in the oven. The pizza I managed was amazing.   Also I had to cut corners on the sauce. Uh.. people are gonna kill me for this... But I used ketchup. I added basil and pizza spice mixture and garlic to the ketchup and stirred it up over heat for a little while. I really liked the product.",5년 전,6,

@semanticsamuel936,"So, for anyone actually trying this recipe, here are some notes from my experience:  The quantities in the description say 530 ml of water (the video says 600 ml - don't do this) to 600 g of flour. This is way, way off. Adam says you need more flour to work in, but you need so much more that the 600 g just might as well not be there. It's all very well saying to work by feel, but if you've never made it before it's hard to know what you're looking for. I made considerable headway into a new bag of flour. This turned into an extremely messy, challenging job. My first attempt at kneading was awful - my hand felt like it was covered in wet cement. I've never made proper pizza dough with yeast before (though I've made cheat pizza dough plenty of times - this time I wanted to get something as close to authentic as I could). Adam says he prefers stickier dough nowadays, which is fine, but I wasn't really sure if what I needed to do was add more flour in or knead for longer. I felt like I was kneading for hours and I never did get it to pass the window pane test. I ended up with close to 1.5 kg of dough (meaning I added somewhere in the region of 400 g more than the recipe says), and it was still rather sticky, but it was workable; however, I've never worked with a quantity of dough this large before - getting a nice stretch for your knead takes it out of you after a while.  I don't to accuse Adam of deception, because I like his videos and personality, but at 1:50 that does not like 530 or 600 ml of water. At 0:38 you can see the quantity of water he puts in (2.5 cups, which is what the recipe says), but then at 1:00 he puts in the yeast and it's obvious he's got much less water in there. So who knows.  Anyway, I'm now proving it in the fridge in four oiled containers. The dough balls are a lot larger than I was expecting. I made the dough on Wednesday with plans for a Friday night pizza, so it'll have a nice long, slow prove. We'll see how it turns out, and I'll edit this comment if I remember in case it helps someone out.",5년 전,1,

I'm also not a fan of the new York style, we call it Marguerita here, not sure if it's what it is supposed to be, but the recipe is really similar. I prefer the mozzarella on my pizza to be soft, not soggy, and I usually throw some classic tomate sauce, dried salami, a bit of thin sliced ham and a few sliced olives on the top, all of that on a really thin and crispy dough. Oh, also the most important thing, fresh basil leafs :)",5년 전,2,
@edkhil," @roborovsky6950  Galbani here doesn't sell fresh mozzarella. Really strange 🤔. Anyway, margherita pizza is just ground tomatoes + mozzarella.

You can get the dough any kinda cooked you want between the stovetop and the broiler.  Leaving the oven on for an hour just to preheat for a 3 minute pizza is a bit ridiculous too.  With cast iron, you preheat to 420, pop that pan out for a couple minutes while you build your pizza, then back in for 10-18 minutes.  It's better tasting pizza, faster.  Less to clean up.

@semanticsamuel936," @greatideas171  I appreciate that. I'm pretty much bang-on average for the UK income wise. I live in a small one-bedroom flat, which I brought six months ago (my first purchase), so I'm not wealthy, though not poor either. What counts as expensive is obviously relative, but the USA has a higher GDP/capita than the UK (roughly $63,000 vs $43,000). A quick bit of research suggests that the average electricity costs in the US are 13.19 cents per kWh, whereas in the UK the average cost is about 17 cents per kWh. I recognise that these figures will vary regionally (and should be taken with a pinch of salt because I haven't verified their accuracy, but they seemed to come from legit sources!), especially in the US and that income disparity in the US is also greater, but the big picture is that the US has a higher average income and cheaper average electricity costs compared to the UK (and much of Europe - other European countries are much more expensive).",5년 전,0,

@rohannasfaw9817,"Hey guys I made this and it went pretty well I wanna tell you my experience!   1. I just wanted to make 2 pizzas and made dough with 2/3 cup of water and 2 cups of bread flour, 1 teaspoon of salt, and sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of yeast, and about a half a tablespoon of olive oil. The dough looked amazing for me  2. if you plan on making these pizzas relatively soon, I wouldn't put them straight into the fridge. I did that overnight and the next morning they didn't rise at all. I had to take it out of the fridge and let rise for 8 hours at room temp for it to be ready.  3. I could only find low-moister, part-skim mozzarella cheese and what I noticed is that you probably don't want to keep this too cold. When baking the pizza, everything was done except I wish the cheese melted a bit more. So if your working with part-skim, don't worry about putting it in the fridge  4. I found that mixing olive oil with some garlic powder in a bowl, and then brushing it along the edges of the dough made for a very tasty crust.   5. if your dough ends up being thin like how it's supposed to, make sure you don't go over 7 minutes in the oven or else it'll be kind of hard/too crispy    happy baking!",5년 전(수정됨),54,

Give it a try. Sugar is a shot cut that isn’t needed yeast is much better than it was in the past and works quite well without sugar also.      You are right about the whole milk cheese block is better. Shredded cheese has a powder of some kind on it to stop from sticking together in the bag it makes it dry.

Second, it might be that the dough is too dry, but adding water before going into the oven makes it sticky once it's done. Lastly, it might just be that I'm forming the crust too thin.

@philipm3173,"That was a good lookin pie, the main disagreement I have is letting the dough sit for up to a week, they become too bubbly and difficult to work with after 4 days in my experience as a pizza chef. Also there are better techniques for forming the dough into balls to prevent too much air from getting into the dough, I like to basically turn/push it into itself and then you want to squeeze between your thumb and forefinger with a twisting motion. The doughs gotta be ""toight!"". When you stretch the dough you have to work it with your fingertips first so you can shape what will be your crust evenly and imo the toss is essential. I prefer to use a silicone brush to apply the sauce. You should put more cheese around the outside than the middle because as it melts it will naturally flow into the center from the crust and you don't want it to pool in the middle. Keep in mind this is a kind of hybrid greek-NY style so might differ depending on what you're going for.",5년 전,3,
@tatodlp,"Hi Adam, I wanted to recommend you to try out baking pizza straight on a wire rack placed on the lower rack of the oven. This has worked really well for me since moisture will easily escape the lower crust which tends to get soggy if you don't use a really hot pizza stone, iron or cast iron pan. I've made a bunch of really nice pies using this method and thought it may interest you since you like to cater to frugal cooks who may not have the time or money to get a nice hot pizza stone. I made your cast iron pizza and it came out great btw! I topped it with goat cheese, fresh rosemary and cracked pepper. Anyways, reach out to me if you'd like more info on the wire rack pizza, I promise it's worth it. If anyone else is reading this you should try it too. Simply build your pizza on a cooling rack, spread out nice and thin and place the pie at the bottom rack of your oven at 420 F. This method seems to be quite forgiving in case you use high moisture toppings like fresh mozzarella, giving you a firm bottom crust.",5년 전,0,

Thanks to you, I learn how to make damn good homemade pizza. I followed your lead to the tee. I even bought the pro Baking Steel Metal pizza plate and its wooden spatula. The pizzas are awesome. Sucker bakes in 7 minutes, tops. It comes out crusty yet chewy at the same time. Love that whole milk low moisture mozzarella. I’m a pepperoni man though, so sorry about that, lol. I have added all kinds of toppings. I must’ve made 20 pizzas so far for all family and friends, they all love me more for it too, lol. Thank you so much for your guidance. Awesome video!!!

I also divided by three instead of four, although I think since is so much stretchier than the last batch 4 may be better for the size I can make.

While it would rise, if the yeast wasn't very fresh and active it would take a lot longer.  Second, it now says 2 1/4 cups of water.  The original had 2 1/2 and it was always way too sticky.  Sticky is good for baguette, but for pizza dough you need to be able to stretch it by hand so it should be dry.  I always wondered why I needed to keep adding flour.  It still made good dough but I always had to adjust.  A packet of yeast is 7g I believe, so a full packet should be just fine.",2년 전,0,

I noticed at 2:20 in this video that you were scooping the flour out with your measuring cup directly from the bag of flour. I think this is packing a lot more flour than intended. I have heard that using this method of measuring flour can lead up to 50% more flour used. King Arthur on their website says a cup of their flour should weigh 120 grams. If you inadvertently were using 50% more flour then it'd be 180 grams per cup. Times that by 5 cups would make it 900 grams. 900 grams and 600 ml would make a 66% hydration dough. Which sounds pretty correct. Would you do a quick flour measuring test? I'd like to know if my theory is correct.",5년 전,1,

Instead of using 600 grams of water only use 390 grams of water to make a 65% hydration dough. If you already started making this recipe and want to fix it, add 323 grams of flour, 6 grams of salt (to keep a 2% salt level), roughly 3/4 tsp of yeast, and a small glug of olive oil. Just throw it into the bowl or stand mixer and finish out the recipe. It will yield about 40% more dough, but it will be the correct hydration level.",5년 전,0,

@n40tom,Here is the answer you are all looking for. The proper hydration meaning water to flour ratio is 60 to 65%. Once you know the weight of your flour then you can just figure about 62% weight in water. Easy peasy . I weigh everything when I am baking or making pizza. It takes the guesswork out of the equation. Good luck,5년 전,1,
@nirglazer5962,"So the thing is (after watching it again) he goes back and sees how many cups he's adding and most likely plugging that into a calculator. His water content I imagine might be a bit high but it's mostly fine. He has 600 grams of flour there which is the equivalent to 5 cups in a calculator, but he doesn't use the cup correctly. For flour, to get the amount of flour in a cup as the calculators say you need to pour the flour into the cup and not scoop it out of the bag. By scooping he's getting maybe 180-200 grams per scoop instead of the standard 120-130. Check it out for yourselves at home. Huge difference",5년 전,1,

@shardperson3777,"So i've spent a few months with the original recipe and then this one, making pizza almost weekly, some important notes: - Adam mentions adding only 600g of flour, but if you're using 600ml of water as he indicates, the total amount of flour you're going to need is about 1kg, the amount of oil is about double as well. This way the recipe will yield roughly 1.2kg of dough, enough for 4 pizzas that will fit in a standard home oven, 3 if you make them rectangular.   - The kneading is likely going to take you about an hour, initially do add only the indicated amounts of flour and oil, then have someone with you to help by adding small amounts of flour and oil, alternating between each until the dough is just right, that person is probably going to have to hold the bowl down while you knead because it's going to be hard kneading about 1.2kg of dough in a bowl that's got nothing holding it down, you should ditch the bowl when the dough is close to finished though.   -If you don't have a pizza steel or stone, grab the thickest piece of metal you can find, even if it's aluminium, anything is better than nothing, just heat it up for an hour before you put your pizzas in the oven.",5년 전,0,

This is my go-to staple Pizza dough recipe. the ratios are perfect. i use Manitoba Flour/Typo 00 and have to use nearly 1Kg but it was to be expected since this flour is so finely milled. My oven is very small and it fits just one baking tray hence my pizza(s) get a little thicker #thicc but because of the flour and the looooong and slow bulk fermentation it is the most airy and light but CRRRRRRISPY Pizza ever. And who cares anyway? it’s the crunchy edges of the lopsided pie but also the thick and chewy parts that make our pizza perfect to us. Me and my SO prefer home made now over restaurant style. The preparation of the dough is so easy. it‘s such a spontanuous food once you filled your fridge with portioned dough. want a pizza? Ready in 15min (prep and all). Absolutely adore this recipe thank you so much!,5년 전(수정됨),0,

@blablakatzen5842,"Baker Apprentice from Germany here: normally, if a dough is knead enough, it's (ALMOST) not sticky. just a hint of flour should be enough to work with it. this stays true for wet dough it is just a pain in the butt to form because it will try to run away all the time.  Furthermore i think the dough you made could be knead further. when stretching it you want it to become so thin that you can look through it like through parchment paper.  i found that the easiest way to knead dough is to mix it up real good with a spoon, just knead it in a bowl shortly to make sure the gluten starts forming and the dough holds together better and than slam it on the table and stretch it again and again. if you are to violent at the beginning however, you will catapult dough all over the room, so be a bit careful.",5년 전,0,

Making this into a long rectangle and rolling it for a pepperoni/cheese roll is perfection. If you try it, no need to use stone, just use a normal pan, roll it up,  brush the outside with olive oil, cut a few slits in the top and put in for 20-25 mins at 375 degrees.

@nshake007," @eyadsy6208  I'm not sure, but when I weighed 2.5 cups of warm water that the recipe calls for, it was 510 g. Also, I have learned that a good pizza dough needs to be about 70% hydration. That means if you are using 600g of flour (as in this recipe), you only need 420 g of water (2 cups of water). (Based on the above recipe, the dough would be 100% hydration, which is not usually recommended for pizzas. Most chefs do a 65% hydration.)",5년 전,0,

@Frank44060," @eyadsy6208  You're right. I forgot to mention that. I added flour, a lot, probably a whole cup or more? Wich matters because a recipe is a ""ratio"" of ingredients so changing one should change the others. Less water may have even better than adding flour, so I'll try that next time. I've made it twice so far.  What I've  found in all my experience with different recipes is if you're trying to learn this as a repeatable skill, you'll probably need to do a few batches to learn the consistency your looking for. I personally don't have the patience to deal with VERY sticky dough, but it was still a bit sticky when not dusted with flour or if you work the dusting into the inside - which  is a good thing.",5년 전,0,

@vincentdebons8280,"Hey Adam, I just did your recipe for a second time. The first time went very well, but the bottom crust was pretty hard. I don't know the reason (I'm using a stone), but anyway. The second time I did it, I totally messed the dough. It was so sticky and I even added 1 more cup of flour and it was still veeery sticky. So I gave up working the dough and placed it in the bowl for 2 days with olive oil (the oil helped to keep it as a ball). I then took it and it was very chewy and always retracting when I tried to work it. But I didn't mind since it was too late to go back. I did the best I could and cooked it on the rock. To my surprise, it had very but bubbles in the crust, but kind of charming. Then my heart flipped when I cut it and tasted it. There was so many bubbles, it was so soft and tasty and the crust was perfect-crunchy. I also messed up with the cheese and added the parmesan on top after the cooking. It was delicious. So everyone, it doesn't matter if you mess your recipes. Sometimes, you can have freaking great tasty surprises. Thanks Adam",5년 전,1,

If you're going to wait a day or more with the amount of water in this recipe you almost don't have to 'knead' it that much- think about the reason for kneading- to build gluten. When you use a cold dough fermenting method, the dough builds its structure slowly so the structure occurs over time and bubbles are forming when the yeast has time to swallow up the sugar byproduct in the flour! Don't stress too much about working the dough before you refrigerate it and know it will be tastiest 48 hours or more after you refrigerate it!",5년 전,1,

@NicholasStein,"There is nothing wrong with a stand mixer.  I have one and use it often especially for yeast breads.  However, that being said, there is something very satisfying about kneading dough by hand or using recipes that do not require kneading.  I am currently fascinated by sourdough, and the best breads seem to come with little or no kneading.  Allowing the dough to develop slowly and using the sourdough starter to expand the bread and folding or lightly kneading really adds a lot of flavor.  My pizza dough is very high hydration and as a result is very soft.  I also make my pizza dough very short using a lot of olive oil.  Making a sourdough pizza this way is devine.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

I made the dough on thursday and I baked it today (72 hours is a good average according to my research lol).  If you don't use a machine to kneed the dough it is better not to put that much water like 350-400 ml (add the water slowly the dough has to be sticky but not too much)  it becomes less sticky if you kneed it for about 15 min without extra flour..... the result is awesome, the crust stay thin and easy to digest (long fermentation with little yeast).

@xTobsecretx,"I have made the pizza from your previous video, and it turned out really well, though I'm still having trouble figuring out when the dough is kneaded enough. I think I did 1/4th of whole wheat flour because I didn't have protein-rich flour, so the whole-wheat seamed like a good way to get extra protein in there.  Also, I found that just using my kitchen shears to cut the pizza was the best method - that way I can cut the pieces right from the cooling rack. This sounds orthodox, but I honestly don't know why I would use anything else in a home-cooking setting - it's the perfect tool for cutting through a somewhat floppy sheet. I get that pizza cutters are great when you have tons of pizza slicing to do in a professional setting, but at home, the shears (make sure to clean them ofc!!) do the job best without smushing.  As for the pizza stone/steel - I don't have one and in the current situation, I definitely won't get one. Instead, I take one of my baking trays, flip it over and put it in the oven as it pre-heats. I know it won't store nearly as much heat as the steel, but it does still store some. Important to only use a single tray because if you use two stacked on top of each other, the top one will fold as you put on the pizza, and now the bottom one insulates it rather than making it brow more quickly.  I also don't have a peel, so instead I am shaping the pizza on baking parchment paper and put it on the back of another baking tray. Then I use that to shimmy the parchment paper with the pizza ontop of the inverted baking tray already in the oven.  All-in-all, I really like this recipe - the dough is nice and chewy and the pizza is rich and filling. My family usually does thin-crust grandma style pizza with much less gluten development, but I like this recipe too. I also layed on some smaller-cut bacon strips that I had in the freezer, which isn't traditional but who cares?",5년 전,0,

It increases the alkalinity and lowers the temp of Maillard reaction and gives the dough a slightly chewier texture! Also, get some food safe mineral oil and oil your peel. Coat it with a thin layer and allow it to soak in to the board overnight and repeat every day for about a week. After that oil after every few uses. You’ll find your dough will refuse to bond to the board. :)",5년 전,0,

Probably added extra 1-1.5 cups in total - but I didn't add flour until the dough stopped being sticky completely - it would still get sticky if I kept kneading it. 3.

@marthaminerva," @ryanhall8770  Yes you want a wet dough, I agree. However, I had to add A LOT more flour to get it similar to the consistency his is at in the video. You can see his dough is not sticking to the side of the bowl and it is very smooth. I added about 2 whole cups of flour and it still NEVER looked like his. My point is something is off with his measurements. Perhaps he used heaping cups, maybe he used older, drier flour, maybe he added 3 extra cups of flour throughout his 10 minute kneading process. Everyone does it differently. I'm just warning what happened to me when I tried to follow his recipe exactly. You should not need to add more than a few handfuls of flour when you are kneading.   I understand you need a wet dough, he says it several times. However he did also say it can be so wet that it is unworkable, and that is what I kept getting. Try it out for yourself, I am just warning others who may want to use a different approach.",5년 전,13,

@strangebrutoo,"After trying to make pizza on and off (mostly off)  for 40 years, last week I decided that what was wrong with my pizza is that I'm cooking the sauce first, which makes it taste like pasta sauce, instead of what I've experiences in NY style pizza parlors. And now one week later I'm watching your video where you virtually say the same thing.  So it must be right, lol !!  But actually, so glad I saw this.  And I too have gone with the wettest dough possible, because that's what it seems like in the pizza joints. Also, because it only comes in 50 or 100 pound bags, I've finally giving up on getting the best flour you can buy for pizza (Pillsbury So-Strong), and bought King Arthur's bread flour like you were using.  You can also buy King Arthur's Sir Lancelot (which has the same protein level as Pillsbury So-Strong) in smaller bags.  I do use a pizza stone but was considering a steel, and I do preheat to 550F for about 40 minutes.  Also, I agree with the oil helping to crisp the dough.  And I do use sugar to bloom for your same reason. Plus, i think it should have a touch of sweetness. Finally, the cheese.  I've always know about the whole milk, but didn't know about low moisture per say, although sometime I have used it.  This is one of the best pizza tutorials because it really covers all of the so called secrets and explains them.",5년 전(수정됨),9,

@FutilioYOtilio,"Really nice to see so many important steps in pizza (sorry i'm a baker and a real pizza lover with a lot of books read and a lot of time spent studying pizza) to be explained and done correctly. Others are correctly adapted to home ovens and personal tastes. Just 2 little notes: even if you use strong flour, if you leave it in the fridge for too many days, the degradation of the protein becomes too significant, and it can be seen at stretching (those small fiber breaks are not entirely good). I would recommend 1 or 2 days for optimal results. The other is just a simple tip, it's nice to see how you let gravity do the work for you, and it's much safer than other methods, but if before that you do a little table stretch by gently pressing down from the center towards the edges, and push the internal air from the middle to the outside, you will get more puffy and crisp edges (although in a more Neapolitan style).

Also I don't like to exactly fallow recipes because there are different strengths of flour. By this i mean that pretty much each pack of flour will absorb different amount of moisture. Also I don't use water. I just add milk. I let the milk warm up a bit add sugar and barley malt, let that all dissolve in milk, and then I add yeast. Then i just mix the liquid to flour with salt.",5년 전,0,

@yvesl,"Don't mess up. If you need more flour: it's because you initially put too much water ;) (0.5 kg flour for  a bit less than 1/2 water, so 230  ml of water). Also, you don't need 24 in the fridge. You are only slowing it to grow. You should be ready after 1h00-1h30 in normal temperature (25°C). ""Doing an easy pizza is... precision in portions"" ! Also you are adding toooooo much Olive oil. This kills the taste of the tomato sauce: use less olive oil and less sugar so the tomato sauce will be bitter and stronger ! Hope it will help. Gravity strech is the way to go (raught is the best => italian). Stone in the hoven needs 45 minutes (save energy, tip: use the fan mode grill to heat fast the stone in 25min then change the mode to normal). Send me a message if you re-do a new video :D  3 years before I made my perfect: New York, Italien, Swiss, French pizzas !

@squatchyy," @Eskolol  The conversion for water from litres to grams is an exact amount, though. So there's no problem with doing it that way. As all of the others have said, the proportions on his dough are way, way off.  First of all, he's not measuring the cups of flour correctly. Scooping directly into the bag (as is done in the video) will get you much more flour than the correct method which is to use a spoon to add to the cup and level straight. So, likely, that 5 cups initially is already heavily compacted and much more than the standard ~120 grams bread flour = 1 cup measurement. He also doesn't mention how much he ends up adding when all is said and done, which, judging by the numerous comments above, is quite a bit.   At the end of the day, you can just estimate by the water amount how much flour is needed (approx.) to be workable by hand. 2.25 cups of water = ~530ml = ~530 grams. 80% hydration is pretty much pushing the max that's workable at home with your hands (and even then, it's almost too high). So, 530 / 0.8 = ~663 grams MINIMUM of flour. Using the conversion for bread flour on King Arthur's own website (120 grams = 1 cup), we see that it's already 5.5 right from the start. And really, people at home don't tend to go above 70% for a ""wet dough"" so it's going to be 530 / 0.7 = 757 grams of flour (nearly 6.5 cups). Wetter the dough, the more time and effort it takes to knead, too. People should aim for 60-65% hydration on their first go, otherwise they'll likely end up frustrated.  The comments above telling people to either a) reduce the water amount, or b) be prepared to add significantly more flour are all correct. The straight ratio of 530 grams water to 600 grams flour WILL be a goopy mess (~90% hydration).",5년 전,1,
@Eskolol,"squatchy Like I’ve said many times. Maybe I was unclear? But there is nothing wrong with measuring water with litres or grams. We know the exact mass and volume of water so there is no change there. The problem is the amount of flour in grams that is written in the recipe. I’ve done the recipe 5 times now succesfully no problem by doing cup to litres conversion when measuring in the flour. The flour amount I’ve measured also is much more than 600 grams in terms of mass, so we know for a fact there is a problem there. But ignoring the mass of the flour and by going with cup to litre conversion, the dough has turned out fine everytime. Thing is tho, that I use 00-flour so the grains are grinded super fine meaning that there is gonna difference in mass compared to other flour types. Maybe that is the problem, but I don’t know.",5년 전,0,

Do you have any sources proving that ""all bakeries in the world"" measure by weight or that measuring by weight is objectively and unequivocally superior to measuring in volume?

@ModernClassic,"Definitely gonna use some of these techniques - most of them brought back a lot of stuff I'd forgotten about actually working in a pizzeria when I was in high school. To me what you're making is NY street corner pizza, though, not ""real"" NY pizza, which is very close to Neapolitan pizza. (Think Lombardi's/Grimaldi's.) They're almost two distinct styles, though what you're making is better suited to home ovens, since the gas ovens most street corner pizzerias have only get up to about 600 degrees. I've wondered about making real NY pizza on something like a charcoal or wood pellet grill; I'd love to see you do a video on that. I feel like it should be possible to get that real wood-fired texture to the crust, and with fresh mozz.  One tip if you're cooking at lower temps (for pizza, meaning 550 or so): par-cook the crust and sauce, then add the cheese and toppings. One of the problems with cooking at lower temps is that the extra time required means the cheese dries out and burns way before the crust is really properly done. I do remember at least this about working in a pizzeria. (If the cheese is browned and blackened like that on top, it's burned. It's not supposed to be like that.)

@buihelgason,"I have a very small fridge, so fermenting four separate dough balls over a week is not possible, but I'm currently experimenting on a ""less fuss"" version of your dough, that I've adapted.  Haven't baked it yet, as it's still fermented, but I'll give the recipe here.   Take 1 cup of lukewarm water, add 1 tbs of sugar and 1 teaspoon of yeast, or 10 grams of fresh yeast if you can get that. Mix in 1 cup of flour and let it sit on your tabletop for 4 hours before letting it ferment in the fridge overnight (20 hours).   the next day, add 1.5 cups of water to the preferment, mix it until everything's dissolved. Now add 4 cups of flour, a glug of olive oil, salt, and mix. Maybe add another cup of flour gradually, as you're kneading.   Place the dough in an oiled bowl, and let it rise in the fridge overnight. The next day, take out the dough and kneed it again, (this is to create more gluten, as I want a super puffy crust, and my experiments have shown that a shit ton of kneading can provide that). Then let it rest covered for 1 hour.   Split it into 4 equally sized dough balls, and place in an oiled baking tray, cover with plastic wrap, or another baking tray, and let sit in the fridge for 24 hours.   Shape as a pizza, top it with whatever tickles your fancy (i like myself a good Neopolitan margarita) and bake! if you don't have a pizza oven, you can place in a baking tray, and fire the oven at full heat for an hour, with the heat on low (the opposite of broiling).",5년 전,0,

@joshuamoore24_7,"I used roasted garlic spaghetti sauce and it works great. I used to work at Pizza Hut and the stuff crust is string cheese rolled over with the edge of crust. The pan pizzas and bread sticks are cooked in vegetable oil. I used to prep them every night. It starts with a large or medium or square pan. A couple to a few pumps of vegetable oil each frozen dough. More oil for a large and less for a medium sized pizza. Each pump equals 1/4 cup of vegetable oil. The hand tossed pizzas are a frozen circle of dough a 1/2"" thick as well as the pan pizzas. The hand tossed pizzas are prepared by spraying a stainless pizza plate with no holes in it, then sitting the frozen dough circle on it. All the pan, hand tossed, and bread sticks are prepared at least the night before being used to make a pizza, and placed in the walk in cooler to cold rise the dough.The cooler is usually around 35°f. The big New Yorker pizza is cooked on a pizza stainless steel plate with holes in it sprayed with cooking oil, and the dough is made fresh at the resturaunts every day. P.S. Pizza Huts pizza cutter tool is the best. It is a half circle shaped blade with a   tubular metal handle on the flat side. With this tool all it takes to cut slices for an entire pizza is rocking the pizza cutter like see saw and turning the blade for each cross cut.🍕",5년 전(수정됨),0,

One suggestion, having screwed up getting the pizza to slide onto the stone off the peel I’ve found a good trick which is to lay (baking) parchment paper on the peel and build the pizza on top of that. When ready, the pizza slides off the peel, parchment paper and all, onto the stone in the oven, no sticking. Within 2-3 minutes the parchment paper can be slid out from underneath the pizza , leaving it to cook on the stone. Or, one can also just leave the paper under the pizza for the entire cooking time. The edges of the paper get  browned but no problem.",5년 전,0,

He is made enough for 4 pizzas of what looks to be at least 12 inches.   You want just one? Divide by four.    150 grams of flour    150 ml of water, hell this 100 percent hydration unless he added in a LOT more flour. I have yet to try anything that wet for a pizza. milliliters of water are one gram each so I go by weight.   sugar 4ml I use grams. And yes I am American but grams are better for this. I have no idea how much that weighs.  OK google says 12.5 grams so try 3 grams, I have a scale accurate to one hundreth of a gram. Its over kill but I the precision but it maxes out at 600 grams so I only use it for small amounts. Try a teaspoon. Which turns out to be 4.2 grams. Should be fine but its a but more than he used.   1/4 teaspoon of yeast which might be about a gram or two, its OK to use more, some recipes use a lot more yeast then is really needed.    1/2 tablespoon olive oil or about 6 or 7 grams and you can use less if you use it as liberally as he does on the surface of everything. I would still use about that amount.   1/4 tablespoon - a teaspoon is 1/3 tablespoon or 3 or 4 grams of KOSHER salt, keep in mind that fine salt would by volume is more salt than the same volume of kosher salt. I use less salt than recipes tell me to use and doughs rise more but are less salty. I tend to add other things, like ginger to compensate.   I used Google for conversions. I always have my PC on.

@ConradOMalley,Greg Cleveland - They looked like 20 oz but the real key is the height. I got some old plastic tubs and the best for dough is like 2.5” in height.   Some containers have lids that really seal well and are more difficult to seal the lid. And they seal perfectly.   Then there are the tubs that you buy sliced ham in. They don’t perfectly seal. That is what you want.   The yeast produces CO2 and will pop the lid off the perfectly sealed containers. First off the noise in the kitchen will freak you out and secondly without a lid the skin of the dough will dry out and that will bum you out.   Also you want kitchen scales to at least weigh the flour and water. It makes it repeatable.   The weight of the water to the dry ingredients is the hydration ratio. I like 250 grams of water and 360 grams of all purpose or bread flour. It is wet at 69%.   Maybe start at 60% (250 grams of water and 416 grams of flour).   A buddy made his first batch of dough so I am in the instructive mode.,5년 전,1,

For NY/Neapolitan style you want:  1000g of flour, 70% or 700ml of water, 30 grams of salt and 2 grams of fresh yeast or half that amount of dry yeast so only 1 gram!!!  For American style you want:  1000g of flour, 65% or 650ml of water, 20g salt, 50ml oil, 20g sugar and 15 grams of fresh yeast or 7.5 grams of dry yeast!!

@andrewwebster13,"​ @mo_gaming_yt9309  Try the calculator I posted above.  1 large Neapolitan pizza would be a 325g dough ball (70% h20).  You'd need 187.6g of flour, 131ml of water, 5.6g of salt & 0.4g of fresh yeast or 0.2g of dry yeast.  Multiply everything by the number of pizzas you want.  Note:  Weighing such small amounts of yeast may prove difficult so make enough dough, you can always freeze it before or after it's risen.",5년 전(수정됨),3,

@andrewwebster13,"​ @bveezy5246  Crap!!  I should have caught this sooner.  Adams recipe is a 100% hydration dough meaning the amount of flour used in grams is the same as the amount of water in milliliters!!!  He calls for 600g of flour and 600ml of water.  Our home ovens don't go up to 750f so it's difficult to understand how that much water makes a usable product. If you followed his recipe you'll need to flour the crap out of the it on all sides.  I cannot stress enough that real Neapolitan pizza is a 70% hydration dough!!  Please check out Vito iacopelli on you tube.  He's a master pizza chef and he does a comparison of 60, 70 and 80% hydration dough!  Adam's recipe should be more like 600g flour and 420ml of water.  Not bashing him he obviously worked with it but I would find it difficult to recommend this.",5년 전,1,

@davemarchetti4255,Garlic!  Why am I not seeing Garlic in the sauce?   I'm from New York but I live in Washington State now and pizza here is unfortunately a joke. It has forced me to try to figure out how to make New York style pizza and I have to say I think this guy is doing a great job all around. He's hitting on most of the same things that I have found but I don't understand why there is no sign of garlic anywhere? Fresh garlic has its place of course but for pizza sauce I have found that powdered garlic is definitely the way to go and what I'm pretty sure they use in pizza restaurants. All that's needed is to add a good amount of garlic powder to that sauce and it will flavor it beautifully the flavor really gets into the oil as well. I always try to make sure my powdered garlic is as fresh as can be because I find the taste gets pretty poor if it's been sitting in the cupboard for ridiculous amount of months. Great video!

@Chronocide420,"Either I'm very confused or something went wrong with converting the numbers you used, but using 600 ml water and 600gr flour results in a pizza dough that has a baker's percentage for water that is 100%, which is basically flour soup.  I used the measurements described above, except i weighed my water because 1 ml is about 1 gr anyway. And as expected it turned into soup, nothing like what is shown in the video, I had to add over 400 grams of flour(not the tiny little bit that was added in the video during kneading) to bring it down to a hydration percentage of 60% which is on the medium side of things. The highest i've seen for recipes online is 70% which is for Neapolitan pizza's which go into very high heat ovens and benefit from quick cook times and high water percentage.  This is not some sort of attack, I'm genuinely curious as to why my dough came out radically different from the video. Maybe its different type of flour, I did use (european) all purpose flour but i can't imagine it making that much of a difference",5년 전,1,

@toninobelimussi296," @Viva_la_natura  Hey, I was joking, man: I know a good pizza when I eat one! The only thing I used to do really well in a normal oven were calzoni (at the highest possible temperature, mind you). I made my own dough, too, basically classic pizza dough. A home oven is great for calzoni, because you want them to be nicely cooked inside and that requires a much lower temperature than cooking a pizza, since your calzone is going to stay twice or thrice the time in the oven. I never order calzone in a pizzeria, they are burned outside and not really ready inside: the temperature is just too high for calzoni in a real pizza oven. I used to press as much juice as possible out of the canned pelati, because you want the whole thing inside to be as dry as possible, otherwise at some point all that humidity will sort of flush out of your calzone and ruin it. I also used special mozzarella (the dry kind) for pizza. I added olives (black, those soft ones you buy in salt water), maybe some ham or tuna (I preferred ham, though). You want to go for two small calzoni at a time, not one big one, that way they'll be much better inside. You know they're ready before they start burning, the browner the better but not black. Check that out, it's the real Italian home-made calzone and it's a real beauty, too.",5년 전,1,

@mrmax1984,"This inspired me to make pizza this weekend. I went right after work to buy the ingredients. As a newb bread-maker (I cook lots of things but hardly ever make bread), I found a few tips that will help first-timers who try to make this recipe. 1) The dough as described will be VERY wet and difficult to work with. I had to add quite a lot of flour to the dough when kneading it and rolling it out. 2) Use a rolling pin if you have one. You'll get much more even dough that way, because it's very stretchy and easy to rupture. If the dough sticks to the rolling pin, add more flour to the surface. 3) Coat the pizza peel very thoroughly with either the flour or cornmeal. My rule-of-thumb was that if I could spin the pizza dough around on the peel, then it was coated enough. My first pizza got stuck on the peel and ended up in a pile on the stone lol. 4) Use a lower oven rack. I found that using the 2nd highest rack resulted in the top cooking thoroughly, but with a pale bottom and uncooked middle. I had to recook each pizza about 6 minutes with foil on top to get a crispy bottom and cooked middle. 5) Use an infra-red thermometer on your pizza stone, and make sure to preheat it long enough. I let mine preheat for about an hour, but that included the time the oven came to temperature. Next time I'll measure the stone's temp to make sure it's hot enough. I think this would have helped with my pale bottoms.  Thanks for putting this video together. Now I have pizza for the weekend. =)",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@kevintas1296,"Thanks for this pizza quest. Really good suggestions / recipe. One twist I offer:  I purchased a 16"" cast iron skillet and use that as the ""steel"" under the pizza. Works nicely, and also useful for other purposes. How to get it hot: don't need to leave 1 hr in the oven. When I start the oven headed toward 550F, I just put the cast iron skillet on the stovetop - medium heat - until the oven is up to temp. Then I put the skillet in the hot oven for 15 min - just to equalize temps. Also i DO recommend a stand mixer. I found that kneading (dough hook) for 15 min makes the dough VERY chewy.",5년 전,0,

The Turkish/Kurdish/ MidEast-owned shops typicallly used the pre-rise method, and the Italian/Irish owned shops used the oven rise method (the dough balls still got 30 minute rise time before being made into pies, but that 30 minutes was typically within 2 hours of baking, so all of the rise was either recent or right in the oven. I always assumed that the reason the oven-rise pizza tasted so much better was that it had ""fresh air"" in the dough, as opposed to the ""stale air"" in the cooler-risen pies. Great video, btw.

As I've been learning, the Hydration of dough is critical in any recipe, and in small batches, a few extra grams of water or flour can make a significant difference.  People  new to dough and baking, should become aware of bakers percentages, and the idea of weight vs volume.  Most importantly, I wonder if the written recipe is incorrect??  Your hydration seems Really off the charts, yet the product looks delicious.  Your written dough recipe calls for nearly equal parts of flour and water??

@bensnyder8155,"How in the world are you getting that quantity divided 4 ways to fit into those bowls after the proof? I've made this recipe - almost to the letter - twice now. The only difference is that I use a kitchen aid for kneading the dough. What I've found is that (1) this recipe demands closer to six cups of flour than five and (2) the dough overfills the bowls after a day or two in the fridge. To fix that I divide the dough into six portions (approximately 250g each). I think next time I'll try it with 2 cups of water rather than 2.5 cups of water and see if that gets me closer to five cups of flour.  Also, I've noticed that after several days in the fridge, my dough remains much more ball-like than yours does. Yours tends to spread out with obvious air bubbles in it. I'm guessing the difference comes down to the fact that I'm using more flour. But without that extra flour the dough remains too wet and never get to the point where I get get a windowpane effect from it.   That being said, the dough cooks up incredibly crispy and light.

A feature that so many other pizza makers overlook and bake it too quickly, I truly think, though, that the biggest key to great pizza that you stress is the very high heat for shorter cooking time. It came out so pliable, and even leftover pizza the next day in the refrigerator was still pliable and soft; it didn't become hard like a cracker, which all other homemade pizza crusts have done before because the lower heat and longer cooking time dries out the dough. Thanks so much for this!! I can now with confidence make great pizza!!!!!",5년 전,0,

"" Several people mention New Yorkers use coal or wood fired ovens.""   And gas as well. They don't all get the same results. The only thing that is specific to a New York pizza, besides actually made in New York, is that they are sort of thin.   "" This guys is making videos for people using regular electric or gas ovens.""   Yes, I said nothing to the contrary. I was pointing a single fact about SOME pizza that are made in New York.   ""So using a steel or stone is essential if you want your pizza as close to a NY pizza.   Wrong as you can do it the I suggested. Heat it up to get a crust in a PAN FIRST. Heck you do it my way and toast BOTH sides of the pizza before putting in an oven. I like a crust on both sides, even below the sauce but that is not needed.   It WORKS. Without a pizza steel or a pizza stone but it is an extra step.    What I was bringing up was the carbon monoxide that likely has some effect in may pizzas made in New York. Coal fired ovens are kind of rare outside of New York. CO is a reducing agent and it stops oxidation in coal fired ovens, unless they force in air. I don't think any pizza shops are forcing in air.

@EthelredHardrede-nz8yv," @Joshsmoove     "" What type of pan are you using?    It was a 12 inch stainless steel pan the last time I did it. I used olive oil on the pan.

I intend to still use olive oil if I ever spend the time on to make the dough.    ""Can I get away with using my cast iron skillet?""   That should work, its just browning the crust. The main reason that I have done this is that it makes the dough rigid enough to slide into my oven. Which is a convection toaster oven.   ""how long should I keep it in there and at what temperature?""   Hot enough to brown and not burn and long enough to brown.    My last notes   ""9/19 10 minutes @ 300 each side no burning.""   That was 10 minutes with my induction plate set to 300. If I wanted to watch it I could have done it at a higher heat and shorter time. The both side part is to brown both sides and get it rigid enough to slide into the oven without it flopping around. I got that idea from something I read somewhere.

@EthelredHardrede-nz8yv," @polareyes4574     "" I use an upside down baking sheet.""   I suppose that would be more effective than a right side up sheet as it would trap hot air under it. But the idea with the steel, or a non specialized pan, is that they have contain a lot more heat than a sheet of steel or aluminum for that matter. That heat can transfer to the dough.

@madeconomist458,"I've used your recipe more times than I can count and both I and my family love it; my dad said that the crust was the best he ever tasted. Praise out of the way, l have a couple suggestions  ""You don't need a stand mixer""   No, technically, you don't need a stand mixer but IMHO, when you can get a kitchen-aid off amazon for under $300, or even less off of ebay, it is worth every f!#king penny and then some. When delivery pizza is $10 a pie, a stand mixer and cheese shredder attachment will pay for itself in no time.   Another item: get a WOOD PIZZA PEEL. Pizza dough will far sooner stick to a metal pizza peel than a wood because the metal will get cold and water will condense on the steel, causing the dough to stick to the peel. The only way to get around this is a very liberal coating of cornmeal or flour, but this interferes with browning: the flour creates a layer of air between the pizza stone and the pizza itself which inhibits heat transfer to the dough, resulting in an undercooked crust. A wood pizza peel allows you to use much less cornmeal or flour and thus creates less insulation between the crust and the stone. Less insulation means more heat transfer which means more browning. With my small italian-made oven using this method, I find that I can get away with pre-heating for only 20 minutes instead of the full hour.   tl;dr, get a kitchenaid-brand stand mixer and a wooden pizza peel.",5년 전,0,

You're great at explaining recipes. Luckily I was able to find the specific mozzarella, the people at the supermarket had to go to the warehouse just to get it for me, absolutely worth it to.

@pnw_Eli,"BTW, from trial and error, I have come up with an ideal cornmeal-on-the-peel coverage technique. Hold the peel over the sink, and then hold the cornmeal box as high in the air as you can with your other hand. Then gently sprinkle it on, making it fall like a dusting of snow onto the peel. The reason I do this is that I'm paranoid about stickage if I just rub the cornmeal on with my hand. The snow method ensures there's no bald spots on the board.",5년 전,0,

It's like the first pizza saps all the heat out of the stone, and therefore the next pizza takes longer or the dough is undercooked. and it becomes a battle to cook the dough before the cheese on top burns too much.  any thoughts? I figure the next time i'll place the stone a little lower so i can accommodate for the pizza taking a bit longer, without burning the cheese",5년 전,0,

@kingofthecrows8802,"Hey Adam, I work for a pizzeria in the Hudson County area of New Jersey, just across the bay from Staten Island. A friendly tip, if your sauce comes out chunky from the oil, just splash some water in with it the sauce and mix well. The water will evaporate out of the sauce when cooking, even in a conventional oven, I've even tried with mine at home. Your canned sauce of choice was spot on! We use the same at my job. Personally, I love tomato paste in addition to the sauce, it really makes a blend between the fresh and pre-cooked and it's much more rich than the slight cooked texture of the tomato sauce. If you're ever in the area, stop by Bayonne, we have a variety of different pizzerias in our 3-mile town. Plenty of public transportation from there to Manhattan and I assure you there's more food than just pizza here that'd be worth your while. You've made an excellent breakdown of the NY style pizza, keep up the research! You've become a true paesano.",5년 전,55,

As of two days ago, my girlfriend gifted me two plants, one of them being a beautiful beefsteak heirloom tomato plant. I was ecstatic, as I have always known that home grown tomatoes are superior, and was very prepared and willing to put in the work to keep it living. These are my first plants, and I really know nothing about growing tomatoes. I have done research, but all sources have had different pieces of advice to give. I live in Arizona, and we are on the brink of summer, a time in which tomatoes thrive, but due to the state's blistering heat, could kill my plants (a thing of which I am unsure). Earlier today, my plant went limp. It still does look alive, but if anything, it just looks sad. I have been following the directions of the small piece of cardstock in giving it at least 6 hours of direct sunlight, but the drooping frightens me. Any advice? Thank you very much.",5년 전,0,

Still I do have standards like yours where I want my pizza to be GOOD else I will scrap it. So my way with no oil still provides top notch results.

Lower hydration dough recipes are really nice and easy in the mixer though (like 55%-65% hydration), but I prefer the taste and texture of high hydration pizza doughs.",5년 전,4,

@Pupil00,"Man I am Italian and I approve of this recipe 👍, but I'd like to give you some advices. Since I work in a pizzeria I know a lot about pizzas, and how we do it is we don't put the oil and salt in the water after the yeast has bloomed, we put them in while we are kneading the dough. And the best way to knead is putting the dough on the counter and placing one hand closed like a fist to the side that's closest to you to hold it and with the other hand stretching the dough forward ripping it apart, then fold it into a log-ish kind round shape and rotate it 90 degrees to left or right and repeat. That's the best way (to my knowledge) to knead a dough. I completely agree with everything else you say in the video, mostly with the part where you explain how to rise the dough and for how long.

@Pazzo1292,"Love this.   A minor point but you don't need to add more flour during the kneading process. While this helps keep your hands clean, advice for beginners is to work through the sticky stage until the dough becomes one homogenous ball. It will always be workable with your method and your hands will be mostly clean by the end. This prevents the risk of creating a too-dry dough - wet dough gives to bigger air bubbles and a crispier base. You can even go 4-parts water to 5-parts flour if you're feeling bold (although this will be closer to focaccia than pizza).    Thanks!",5년 전,0,

@maxwellrichardson1558,Hello helpful comment here.  2 things for those cooking pizza in an oven:  1.) put a thin layer of olive oil down before  your sauce if you like a really crispy bottom  2.) cook the pizza with just the sauce on for 3-5 minutes then remove and add cheese and finish cooking. This will allow the motz to melt without separating significantly. This also allows you do do an extra cheese pizza without the cheese getting chewy.   Bonus: theres a $100 pizza oven on amazon. Just put it on your stove top and it uses your burner to get up to 800-900 degrees,5년 전,0,

@leesalt,"Couple tips:  Bobs Red Mill semolina is course ground and acts as a great way to keep things from sticking but it bakes into the crust without making the final texture grainy. If you want an absolute stress free method, however, simply make your pizza on a sheet of parchment paper and throw it right onto the steel. I cook it for 5 minutes then pull it out from under the pizza to finish cooking it under the broiler since my crappy oven only gets to 500. This method prevents any bunching or sloshing from the dough sticking and ruining the goods. The broiler is key if your oven barely reaches 500, like mine. Make sure that when the broiler is on, you keep the door open and you keep an eye on it. It only takes a minute to go from perfect well-done bake to inedible charcoal.",5년 전,0,

After a almost a full day in the fridge it certainly didn't look like the vid...had to Geryrig a bit and got it going.  I've seen ""1 packet"" (2.25 tsp) for 2.5 cups of flour elsewhere.

@philipm3173,"Fairfield county, CT checkin in, that was a good lookin pie, the main disagreement I have is letting the dough sit for up to a week, they become difficult to work with after 4 days in my experience as a pizza chef, too bubbly (yes that is indeed a thing) . Also there are better techniques for forming the dough into balls to prevent too much air from getting into the dough, I like to basically turn/push it into itself and then you want to squeeze between your thumb and forefinger with a twisting motion. The doughs gotta be ""toight!"". When you stretch the dough you have to work it with your fingertips first so you can shape what will be your crust evenly and imo the toss is essential. I prefer to use a silicone brush to apply the sauce. You should put more cheese around the outside than the middle because as it melts it will naturally flow into the center from the crust and you don't want it to pool in the middle. the end",5년 전,0,

@Navii-05,"Hello. So, what I want to do with this message is to simply show what the Gospel is.  I am not trying to force my belief down people's throats.  It's your choice whether you want to accept it.  So, a question: Do you think you are a good person?  If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, watched adult material? All of those are sins and anyone who sinned is not good(on God´s standard). You, I and most( most because babies don't sin, and maybe specifically mentally Ill people) purely human beings have violated God's moral law.  Since God is just, He can not let sin go just like that. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve, we deserve to be punished because we have sinned.  The reason why blood must be spilled for forgiveness of sins is because the life of the flesh is in the blood, in the Old Testament Jews sacrificed animals for sins but the  sacrifice of animals were enough to temporarily cover some sins. (it did not allow forgiveness of sins, unlike Jesus´s, it only temporarily covered them)   Jesus is the Lamb of God, the ultimate sacrifice for sins which is enough for all sins that have been done, are done and will be done. He was buried and rose again. His  resurrection proved that His death was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins.Jesus paid our  penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must trust in Jesus's spilled Blood, His finished work on the Cross for our salvation. And then your  sins will be forgiven because of what Christ did, you will be saved.  See: Romans 3:10, Romans 3:23, Romans 5:12, Romans 6:23, Romans 5:8-9, Romans 10:9-10, Ephesians 2:8-9, John 3:16, Leviticus 17:11, Ephesians 1:7, Colossians 1:20,  1 Corinthians 15:1-4. https://youtu.be/lbb4xwYj19g Evidence for God´s existence: Kalam cosmological argument, Contigency argument, Modal ontological argument. Regarding Christianity, check out InspiringPhilosophy´s videos about the Ressurection of Jesus and the reliability of the New Testament. Together, they show good evidence that Christianity is true.-",4년 전,0,

If you freeze it after rising, you get a well raised dough, but it tends to be rather wet - even more than what Adam shows in this video - when you take it out, leading to a less crispy pizza. I thus prefer to put the dough into the freezer right after making it. I then take it out a few days before I want to make the pizza and keep it in the fridge.   While this doesn't rise nearly as much it causes the dough to be a lot more stable, which allows even thinner pizza. I'm down to a large pizza from about 120g of dough.",5년 전,0,

@Jimbot256,"I actually tried to make my own today! Unfortunately attempt one was a complete failure because the dough refused to exit the peel. But that's OK, was my first time and I learned a lot. The second attempt I didn't cold rise the dough because I was hungry and I only made enough dough for one pizza the other day since I'm the only pizza eater in my house; it was harder to stretch out. I also over-compensated dusting the peel since I didn't have any coarse flour or cornmeal. Regardless, the pizza came out pretty darn alright. The sauce and cheese did the heavy lifting since the dough was so-so.   It was definitely a good learning experience and I know what kind of changes I'd make. Do you have a BJ's near where you live? One near me sells the Galbani whole milk low moisture string cheese. I'm sure each place has different inventory but it might be worth checking out? Either way, your video really helped me out a bunch! I love pizza and have tons of places around where I can get really good pies but I'm broke as a joke and making it at home will definitely help me with the budget.",5년 전,0,

@BigGeak," @aragusea  I know the recipe you posted will turn out fine since it's still a great pizza recipe, but... new pizza.

@aragusea," @BigGeak  the cardboard is a potential (and rather risky) replacement for the peel, not the stone/steel. The peel is the big wood or metal thing you use to transfer the pizza into the oven. The stone/steel is the screaming-hot surface you cook the pizza on. To make this style of pizza at home, I think you need a pizza stone or a pizza steel. You could try heating up a cookie sheet and using that instead, but it retains so little heat that you won't get a very brown crust. Another option is to use a heavy pan, in which case I would recommend this recipe instead: https://youtu.be/uYxB4QBlrx4",5년 전,238,
@BigGeak," @aragusea  I need to buy a peel, somehow I have a pizza stone, I just need to figure out what the best way to transfer the pizza to the stone, from what ive seen the baking sheet is a good idea, but I wanted to see what you would do in a pinch.",5년 전,59,

@radovanjeposran," @dlbstl  I do the same, because first two attempts of making adams pizza resulted in my pizza tearing and topping falling and burning on the stone. Now I just use the parchment paper on cutting board. Since I dont have to care about pizza sticking to the pizza peel, I can take time and make my pizza as large as my pizza stone and as thin as it gets. Browning will probably not be the same (but I only tried with stone, maybe steel will be better even with parchment paper). Still crispy though.  Maybe once I have bigger oven I will try the pizza peel technique again, but not anytime soon.

If cooking is your hobby, it's perfectly normal to expect to put a fair amount of money into it.

That's all there really is to it.",5년 전,4,

@Boyetto-san," @theclockworkcadaver7025  I'm Asian, living in Asia, and cooking is a hobby of mine too. I hand knead dough for bread or pizza on a weekly basis and still never felt the need to splurge on a KitchenAid. It takes like 10-15 mins of actual work when you use bread flour. Maybe its because I never work with more than 300g of flour at a time, but even if I make bigger batches, I still wouldn't think it was worth it to buy a machine that expensive to do what I can do just fine by hand. Instead, I used that money I saved to buy things like a sous vide, which does something that I can't just do with my hands. Priorities, really.",5년 전,1,
@theclockworkcadaver7025,"BoyBalastog Good for you, but you seem to conveniently forget that kneading pizza dough isn't the sole function of a stand mixer. It legitimately makes many different areas of cooking much easier and less repetitive, arguably making it more enjoyable. What you don't seem to understand is that your very, very specific experience and preferences are absolutely not universal. Most people (who enjoy cooking) could probably get a lot of use out of a stand mixer. Is it really worth your time to argue the point here?",5년 전,1,
@rockshot100," @Boyetto-san  Yeah, when you figure how hard to work to earn enough to use a machine, only occasionally, then you still have to knead anyway...not worth to me, or not logical.  The trick is to mix with a spoon until it comes together, and  that is not that  hard to do.  People have been doing it for thousands and thousands of years, why be so lazy?  I do recommend a huge chef's bowl like he is using, the bigger the better, I use mine about every day and it is a breeze to wash.",5년 전,1,
@Boyetto-san,"​ @theclockworkcadaver7025  Whoa there, I'm not the one making a universal statement about what kinds of people are or aren't willing to ""put a few thousand into"" their hobby, or that ""nobody can't afford a mixer"", friend. I gave my specific use-case because you misunderstood +Sturla Moltzau's point. Plenty of home cooks in different cultures can get into making foreign foods on a regular basis these days, but still not be as willing to spend on an expensive piece of equipment the way maybe an American home cook would.    By all means, a good standmixer is a very cool and very functional thing to have. But it's to say that when it comes to the hesitation to buy into it, for all sorts of valid reasons, there are plenty of people out there who're just as into baked goods but don't have the luxury of taking lightly that it ""takes some people longer to save for"" a mixer, as if the only reason why people don't have one is because they don't ""love"" cooking enough. Simply put, there's no need gatekeep here and make patronizing assumptions about people's willingness to spend.",5년 전,1,
