@dipakpuprety,"Hi all 🙏  In Nepal, there are Thousands of kids under poverty in the country and unable to afford school education. We are working to establish a philanthropy school for free modern education with the latest technology for under poverty children. Our dream is to select 5 children from each district every year (there are 77 districts in Nepal, it means our plan to do admission of 385 students with residential facilities for them and subsequently it will expand from 77 districts to 753 local levels in the next 10-15 years). Along with school education, we have plan to provide them vocational training after 10th standard to become proficient in at least one profession, which helps them to become skilled workers or self-employed to improve their lifestyle.  We are looking for helpful hands for this dream project. If any of you interested to know more about the project and would like contribute please contact us through email Dipak.Uprety@hotmail.com or Mob.
