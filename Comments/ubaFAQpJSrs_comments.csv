He knows designers and collections from years ago stuff like that but a puffy winter jacket to critique looks at the met gala that was a choice. Also camp is so up for interpretation it’s not as simple as say something like “black tie” so the Criticism shouldn’t be that harsh. Fashion and what looks good is so opinion based it’s not like you can literally prove something looks good or not. You just sound like a brat in the worst way. Yea Rita Ora in probably most peoples opinion wasn’t very campy but not following the theme and being a “mess” is not the same thing. She still looked beautiful regardless. A young gay with no authority on fashion calling someone’s look a “mess” groundbreaking. It’s never been done. I want to see the looks and I want someone with a little bit of knowledge educated critique on said looks but come on. A bitchy, Bratty, twink being harsh without reason just meh.",3년 전(수정됨),1,

@XleahrachelleX,"Anna: One of her better met gala looks, yet still ugly! Rita: Theme who? Karlie: Why? Why? Why? Dumb model vibes Lily: I fuckz with it, & it’s camp enough for me Lena: I hate 80s suits so much, but the color is nice, I like the black drag queen message, & in itself it’s campy enough Emma: Lazy way to do the theme, next - Violet: I appreciate the glove, but as Luke says, it’s not that interesting. At least it’s something somewhat creative tho. Solange: I’m so tired of seeing people praise her “amazing fashion sense.” It’s a boring ass reptile skin. She can go home, & tell Beyoncé to come in her place. Thank you. Cara: Agree Luke. It’s terrible, but it’s 100% camp. THANK YOU CARA FOR DOING IT RIGHT! Diane: Yes, it’s camp, but I also hate it lmao Nina: Just bc it’s Zac Posen doesn’t mean it’s gonna fit the Met theme Nina. Take your little ballerina dress & go home. (I could care the hell less that it’s 3D printed) India: Boring. Dinner dress. Get off the red carpet with this crap. Camilla: It’s a disgusting prom dress that reminds me of Sesame Street big bird feathers. Gabrielle: I don’t hate this look, but it’s a regular ol red carpet dress. Not camp, not even met gala worthy. Naomi: Hate it. And I expect way more from Naomi. She should’ve just came nude with the lace stockings. That’s what I want. Donatella: Really really bad. BUT at least it’s camp. Zendaya: 2 years later I still hate this Cinderella moment, but I also still appreciate that it lit up. Performance art is always needed more at met. Btw the collar thing looks like pillows lol awful Kate: She looks like a, shiny witch? As Luke said “why do they even show up?” Exactly! Lupita: Awful and camp. She looks like a character from a children’s book. Tessa: We love the bdsm hair, we hate the god awful dress thing Nicki: “Disappointing.” “Early Nicki Minaj is camp.” “I haven’t seen crazy Nicki Minaj in forever.” “Bye.” Can’t say it better than Luke here. Gemma: I’m so tired of Gemma just doing Asian themes & pretending it ties to the Met theme like we get it Gemma you rep your heritage, this just ain’t the event for your own theme Ezra: “That bitch is camp.” One of the best looks of the night by far. I’ll still remember this look when I’m 100. Julia: This dress is truly amazing, I just don’t feel like it’s on theme enough really? I mean better than most at least. Not loving the headpiece tho Katie: Yeah. It’s bad. Go back to being a Scientology shill. Bella/Jeremy: Shame on you for making Bella look like this. Shame! On! You! Gwen: This is just ill-fitted stage wear. She has a great body & this doesn’t flatter her at all. Love the immaculate fur coat tho Cardi: I’m not about the rug. I just wanted her to lose the bird touches, & especially the headpiece. But all in all, I really felt like she was going for a Rihanna 2018 moment with the massive circular train, & that’s what’s so offputting about it. She wanted a moment but didn’t deliver. Selma: I always hate her looks, but this was one of her better dresses. If only it was actually on theme we’d be getting somewhere! Emily: I’m not mad about it, it was memorable, I just don’t love it. JLo: Pretty much the same concept. Memorable, not mad, just don’t love it. Ciara: No. Just no. It’s not working for me at all. The hair is camp, that’s all I can say. Kylie/Kendall: As much I dislike the Kardashians, I’ll be obsessed with this duo-look for years to come. It’s sexy, it’s beautiful, it’s camp. They really did everything right here. Gal: I really don’t hate this look, I actually think it looks nice on her. But met? Camp? Nah. Emma: She can’t dress. She just can’t. I hate this so much. Moving on - Tracie: I am truly just not a Tracie Ellis Ross fashion fan at all. But she IS camp. And this IS definitely camp. Kasey: Wasn’t my favorite look, but I like the concept. And we can ALL agree Barbie is one of the queens of camp I mean come on. Serena: This is a good color for her, but the dress is just bad bad. No no. Priyanka: Whoever did her hair & makeup for this night needed to be fired immediately. It was memorable in the absolute worst way.  Dress is bad, but I do like the color scheme of it actually. Katy: Hated it, always have, always will, but at least she always tries. I can’t knock her Met efforts. Like Rihanna & SJP she always takes the theme very seriously even if it doesn’t really work out. Kim: Her silhouette in this dress will still be being talked about 2 decades from now, & that’s pretty camp in itself. But god she just looks.. so inhuman. But that’s what happens when your body is sculpted by the plastic surgery gods of Hollywood. Gigi: I totally forgot about this look, so clearly it wasn’t that great. Reminds me of Emily & JLos look so it wasn’t that unique either. Gigi’s definitely had better Met nights. Lucy: Ugly. People who dress like this have no taste. Next- Michael: I mean, it’s just a regular red carpet suit. It’s not camp sweetie. Elle: I still cringe every time I see this lol. Can her fashion taste please grow up? I’m tired of seeing her look like my first Barbie doll. You’re an adult now hun Lily: Hated it then, hated it now. One of my least favorite dresses of the night honestly. Especially since she’s so beautiful that I expect more of her in general. Cole: Bring your narcissist ass home boy Hailey: This isn’t special. Thongs aren’t camp. Haileys done better. Shawn: “Disappointment” Rosie: I actually like this dress, but it’s for a regular red carpet. Not the Met, definitely not the camp theme. Should’ve worn this to another event I would’ve been happy Miley: It’s a bad 80s cocktail dress. Bye Hannah Montana Hailee: I don’t mind the campy theme. The dress is just not good. Should’ve done this with a different dress that was actually cute Sophie/Joe: They look like a bowling alley floor Janelle: It’s not my taste. But it’s memorable, & it’s camp. Thank you Janelle for that Halsey: Sweetheart this isn’t the Grammys. Get with the theme or go home you just look embarrassing Ru: It’s camp, but god it’s also so awful. And yes, he should’ve done drag. Someone paying 35k for your ticket should count as being paid sorry not sorry. Lizzo: Lil Kim gone wild. One of the worst of the night. Another memorable in a bad way Joan: It’s like an ugly winter bridal dress that someone from that gypsy show would pay way too freaking much for. Next- Lily-Rose: Her fashion tastes are so boring. She gets too much hype & too many passes just for being Johnny Depps daughter & being young. Hold her to the same fashion standards as everyone else! Giselle: It’s a pretty dress. But she don’t belong here in it. Dua: I’m not mad. It’s average in the camp department. Do really like the colors & she looks good with her hair like that. Actually the more I look at it the more I do like it. Zoe: Sometimes she serves. Sometimes she thinks all she has to do is show a little skin & show off how skinny she is. Tonight was the latter & it was boring. Kerry: Gross! You can’t just throw words on a dress & call it camp. Embarrassing. Aquafina: Just go home. Get in the car & leave. Gemima/Lena: It’s camp, I’m pleased Saoirse: Meh Yara: I kind of like this??? Laverne: I’m ok with this look. She looks like a sexy villain Constance: I like the dress, it’s just not on theme Emily: I like it. But is it camp? Diana: Nope. Boring. Basic. Oscar Wilde where? Hat and cane? Jared: I love this. It’s memorable. I just think it was more fitting for the 2018 Catholic theme. Campy as fuck tho. Narcissists can do camp best, what can I say Tiffany: No. Its boring. I can get this exact look at Party City for a Halloween costume Madelyn: Not loving the shape of this gown. Boring red carpet event dress Michael: I dig the androgyny, I just think Ezra did it 10x better & classier this year Billy: God I hated this so much. But it’s certainly freaking camp. Kris: At least she tried James: Why are you here? He’s looking like he should be in a porno sorry not sorry. I cannot stand the nipple cutout. Frank: Tired overnight security guard vibes lmao. Is that camp to blend in with security? Darren: It’s bad babe Celine: Celine as a Cher Vegas showgirl is camp enough for me (I’ve begun to skip ppl bc it’s so disappointing) Odell: Its sexy, it’s campy, I’m fine with it Cody: This is fashion done right Jourdan: It’s Zac Posen, it’s 3D printed, & I’m still not interested I’ll forget it exists by tmrw Harry: I miss this blouse on him. Hot af! Gaga: I wasn’t interested in the fashion at all; but the performance art was EVERYTHING & we need more of it every single year.  BEST: Lily Collins, Cara Delevigne, Ezra Miller, Julia Garner, Kylie & Kendall Jenner, Kim K, Jared Leto, Cody Fern, Harry Styles, Lady Gaga WORST: Karlie Kloss, Camilla Mendes, Nicki Minaj, Katie Holmes, Emma Stone, Lily Reinhart, Halsey, Ru Paul, Lizzo, Kerry Washington, Aquafina,",4년 전,0,

If you're interested in a tiny background of him, his entire life was essentially an ode to camp culture. Today, we know him best for his strange, 3D-but-2D style of abstract art. However, he was so much more at the time. He mastered everything from abstract sculpting to realist painting, but he worked in phases. Picasso would obsessively work in one art style until he was known worldwide for his accomplishments in that field...and then he'd take a sharp turn into something drastically different, and start the process all over again. Whenever he would get pinned down with one style, he immediately felt the need to express something new. What better way is there to exude ""camp"" than that?",5년 전,0,

If I was a celebrity I would not want to buy into the overpriced overdone designer label fashion critic approved rubbish. Sorry your channel is hugely entertaining and listening to your critique is interesting but just remember that celebrities have their own agenda too and it's not always about impressing fashion critics with runway looks that look awful in real life.,5년 전,0,

The fact that you wanted Constance Wu to do a over the top Chinese inspired look is the most mainstream idea you could have had for any Asian Actor on Camp at the Met Gala. Honestly, if we're really talking about Camp and being Campy, for Constance showing up in the most traditional dress from her heritage would have been most Camp considering how whitewashed Asians are in Hollywood and how whitewashed the history of Asian Americans is. That would have been subversive, to be so Asian at an American Royalty event.

@idrisa7909," @mediocre_violist  I mean yes, I agree that people are unnecessarily mean too often for comedy, but he does make nice videos and this particular subject is one I find roasting people to be especially funny- as he mentioned, camp is partially about being hated and outcast, and it's being picked up by celebrities and mainstream culture because they like what the people they marginalized and treated like shit made, and now they get to make a duck ton of money off it. So in this case I particularly enjoy criticizing people who didn't understand the assignment. Additionally a lot of fashion- design, critique, etc, is going to come off as mean if you aren't familiar even when it isn't especially so, because you live and die by opinion in fashion. I don't agree with probably at least a third of Luke's opinions honestly, I think he prioritizes his own taste even in nicer videos and doesn't understand aesthetics or subculture that well, but his job is to prioritize his own taste and he is learning more about things that aren't just his aesthetic and the mainstream aesthetic. There are nice fashion channels, but even they will occasionally have a ""mean"" opinion or video, because opinions are like assholes; everyone's got em.  I'm not saying give up on learning about fashion, but this is a fairly common kind of thing you're gonna hear if you watch videos or read pieces on it, and how much if it there is is gonna vary depending on creator and what the piece is for.",4년 전,4,

ANNA WINTOUR blessed ya with a look that was not only on theme but really Muva was paying homage to Lagerfeld who created this look for Anna personally before his death. so Anna should’ve just been worried ab securing that bag for the museum, but she still showed up x showed out.   whew, you came in hot, no? 🥵🤬😎",6년 전(수정됨),0,

Even if people don’t nail the theme I just enjoy when people go all out in something wild. Like Lupita and Janelle Monae weren’t necessarily camp but they wore interesting, directional looks. I thought Kacey Musgraves nailed the camp theme as a literal Barbie. I hate it when people just dress like they’re going to a film premiere (Gisele and Gwyneth, always.)  I think camp is more about an attitude than a particular style of clothing, but that’s just me. Like many things could be campy depending on the context and the attitude. Benedict Cumberbatch cosplaying as Oscar Wilde was pretty campy to me, because it was both pompous and silly at the same time. Even if the outfit itself was pretty classic as far as things go.",6년 전,0,

There's a zebra head on his shoulder and the boa situation is black hair (synthetic I'm guessing) which is the zebra's mane. The zebra also has a little blue face harness.

@annarose932,"Ideas for looks inspired by the theme Camp: *Marie Antoinette, especially with a large ballgown skirt and a white wig at a large height, with a large boat and perhaps apples and flowers and a crown. *Resemble the character from Oscar Wilde's 'The Importance of Being Earnest', Lady Bracknell. With a exaggerated Victorian dress and large bonnet, white gloves and cane, perhaps sitting down on the runway carpet drinking tea with cucumber sandwiches. And of course... A HANDBAG!! *A Elizabethan dress with intricate details and a red wig and white powdered makeup, or a mens suit with a Elizabethan collar and wig, inspired by a extra as a Capitol resident in the first Hunger Games. *Look at the outfits from the Hunger Games, especially Effie Trinket, and take inspiration there! *A vaudevillian villian, with a long Victorian black top hat, suit and waistcoat, a cane that bends slightly while leaned agasint it to add comedy, with a twirled moustache and twisted thin beard, either carring a bag of money (as if it had been robbed) or arriving with a friend dressed as a damsel in distress, with a long feathered old western type dress and actually tied up with thick rope. *Go as the Queen of Hearts; Mad Hatter; Chesire cat or Alice in oversized dress, representing the weirdness of Wonderland. *Resembling Sharpay Evans, go in a glitterly raincoat with a bunch of matching suitcases, as if you have come from the airport as a spoilt rich brat. *A high heel shoe on your head as a hat and two different hats as your shoes, and perhaps your outfit worn backwards or upside down. *Inspired by the character Miss Havisham, go as a crying brides in a big, lumpy, dusty and slightly yellow wedding dress, with mascara running down as makeup and one shoe off (representing book). And whenever a reporter talks to you, you just cry and mumble to play up to the character. *Something inspired by Phantom, with a long cape and mask perhaps? *Go as a ballgown with the Cookie Monsters face, with blue feathers and eyeballs on the head to give the illusion of the face. Or Elmo or any of the Muppet characters. *Go as a ballgown of the Joker and a suit as Harley Quinn as characters, would have been so cool with the patterns and bright colours.  *I know this is cliched, but go in a lonh elegany banana skirt along with a nude illusion and something as a headpiece (not too sure), inspired by the showgirl and WW2 spy Joesphine Baker. *A dress or look inspired by actresses Fenella Fielding's character from 'Carry On Screaming', Valeria. AND... arrive in a puff of smoke, as the character did.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

The line was too fine between being some kind of a joke rather than an example for the evening.. I mean look at rupaul.. And he didn't even do drag... I think the pressure was just too much.. When you are camp for a living and someone says do this but big..too much.. I honestly loved violets dress.. It was chic and camp in the 50s hollywood movie sense of the word.. A play/pun.. Fit like a glove.. I gasped whe. I saw her.. It was camp with dignity.. All the black outfits seem to follow this.. So i think it was an suggested.... option Cardi was the only one who really was able to freely be what the invite wanted without rammifications... Because as far as I can tell she goes hard but never this hard before.. Less pressure in that sense.,6년 전,2,

@LegoUSB,Loved the video but I think you missed the campiness in Harry Styles’ outfit - it was very subtle and elegant but still campy not just because it was androgynous and playing with masculinity/femininity. It was a reference to the Oscar Wilde kind of dandyism. It took those aesthetics of excessive and artificial upper class refinement to somewhat of a ridiculous conclusion: to something that is no longer upper class refinement. There was camp in that irony and reference.  But I do think he often alludes to dandyism in his outfit and red carpet looks so it would have been interesting to see something different and more extra.,6년 전,12,

@lamb248,"you alwaaaays say exactly what i am thinking about every look. i desperately needed ezra in a heel or a more sleek shoe, and i think the look needed earrings. i also would have traded the mask for a cartoonishly long cigarette holder.  and julia garner in zac posen was one of my fave looks of the night. i think it was more of a non-camp perspective of camp. like rather than lean into the distorted and ironic nature of camp, take a standard genuine fashion approach to the glamour that camp is referencing. as well as the performative aspect bc she literally looked like a silent film goddess who just walked out of a screen. so it's like a perfect replica of this era of film which was extremely camp because it was entirely melodrama and overacting, often set in these fantastical but highly fabricated lands. like the film took place on an alien planet or underwater and they had these lavish sets, but you can also see how fake everything is and how it is a complete performance. isn't that camp?

SECOND of all, camp is not ""over-exaggerated and big."" You could walk the red carpet tiddies out, thong on, and a piece of chiffon draped over one shoulder and make it camp. If you didn't at least get that from the video like.. I don't know what to tell you. Whoever told you camp isn't allowed to be sexy doesn't understand camp. It's self-expression in its rawest form. Sure, for many it's not caring about social expectations or what you're supposed to look like, or challenging norms, but that's not all camp is.

The 60's/70's space age fashion were campy for me... show up in a Pierre Cardin hula hoop dress or something.   They could take inspiration from icons like Isabella Blow, Iris Apfel and just go an extra mile. They could also take inspiration from art, I don't know why no one thought of Salvador Dalí... A Philip Treacy lobster hat, a heavily embelished Gucci brocade suit, ruffles, maybe a lobster phone out of a cloche.  These people are boring and uninspired.

@princessofpigs,"love my drag sisters but the term ""Camp"" wasn't even coined by queens. It was a term used to describe low budget tackily dressed 1960's colour films, such as teen beach movies or basically anything with Elvis in it. It was taking what should be classic feminine beauty and twisting it to new and transformative  levels. This is why there were so many 1960's references. . During the 1980's camp was adopted by the drag community as part of their language but they don't have claim over the word. Alot of these comments are like ""HOW DaRE CeLeBrETIEs MOck DrAG CULture"".

@viviennely1864,"RANT / UNPOPULAR OPINIONS 1. I feel that people didn’t read Notes On Camp or they just chose to blatantly ignore it??  2. So many people just went for the “million feathers” comment but like their looks were not campy in the other senses explained. E.g. RosieHW was NOT campy at ALL. Yes she had a massive train of feathers but her look is so serious it would “succeed” in the eyes of the general public at a different event which completely defies the point of camp.  3. People thinking that camp is only being extravagant. No. There are other aspects such as androgyny, irony, subversion, sensuality, exaggeration, etc.   4. I hate when people said that it’s about being elegant  5. I think that Haileys dress was actually campy. It was a play on being innocent and demure with a pale pink gown which covered her arms and neck in the front but then she turns around and the hole in her dress is bigger than the holes in my heart! And the thong too! But sis really needs to get her back checked  6. Kim and Kylie were literally already campy because of their plastic surgery. They’re bodies are extreme exaggerations in themselves. And I think Kim wore like spandex or there was a corset or something because her waist seemed smaller than usual and she was breathing quite heavily so she went even further to accentuate her hips and small waist, albeit superficially.  7.Things I would’ve really liked for someone to wear: - silicon full bodysuit that was a remake of their body, similar to the FECAL MATTER skin boots.  - Moncler 5 by Craig Green especially the tent looks or anything that was a play on camp as in the outdoor activity - anything on a man that wasn’t a black suit idc if u tried different textures  - I really wanted someone to show up in a full 18th or 19th century gown or something with that silhouette,",6년 전,0,

It's probably my own experiences with what has been called camp around me, especially watching Drag Race and seeing when they call a look by a queen camp.   I find myself wanting to get these vibes from a camp look: Fun, exaggerated till gaudy, almost costumey. These vibes need to come through the sillhouette and shape of the garments, they need to come through in the colours and detailing.   I'm so glad i clicked on HauteLeMode today and got to see all the feelings i had communicated back to me and affirmed. Most of these looks were just pretty SANS camp.

@albertconstantine5432,"All it did was prove to me that almost no one today understands what camp is.    Of course Sontag did not invent it and neither did black drag queens (enuf with the credit appropriations, which is SO neo-Soviet.), although Sontag helped explain it and black drag queens, black fancy men, other black entertainers and many other African Americans certainly were co-developers. And Sontag did more damage than good, rather like a Southern Baptist in 1928 trying to codify Harlem jazz to her fellow congregants after a trip the NYC.   Camp can be self-conscious about itself or clueless about itself, but it requires an insider/outsider dynamic. Camp is an exchange. It is not mere exaggeration or ugliness. It is not just ""over the top"" or hideous or wrong. It is not about misused media or inappropriate fabrics. Subversion and transgression are involved, but only with commitment.    If it is self-conscious, it needs the friction between the people who get it and the people who don't. HauteLeMode's spokesspeaker is right about the performance aspect of camp. And, too, if it is NOT self-aware, it requires others to see its campiness and celebrate it. Edith Massey in her debutante dress in ""Polyester"" may well have felt pretty. Her unselfconsciousness delivered, however, because she was used as to deliver a camp expression (again) by Waters and the audience got it.     Camp, in its delivery, also needs a point. Camp does not exist unless it has a purpose. What we saw here was people for whom the purpose almost always was to LOOK CAMPY. That is as far from the point as it could get.    So for the Met Gala, we had a pack of clueless celebrities in the hands of non-savvy designers attempting to exhibit a concept they didn't understand and certainly cannot embody. Apart from a couple pieces, camp was not presented and it certainly was not celebrated except as a target to try to hit. In this setting it probably could not be achieved. All we could get was a costume parade of people vying for ""most silly."" The people mostly lacked commitment, either to cluelessly deliver something they thought was fabulous for our informed enjoyment in quite a different way, or to say something in an outrageously driven way that expressed an emotion, a position or a cultural statement with absurdity, wit and true fabulousness in mind and heart.   Any event where Kim Kardashian being herself was one of the highlights (ugh) shows the errors involved.    But the signal camp moment was Cher performing, which by itself lifted the whole thing out of the pit of confused and monied ego and flung a good measure of perfumed horse shit back into the faces of the zombies in attendance.

I also feel like no one created a head to toe look that brought the dress or outfit together. Some people had a decent outfit but was so disconnected with the make up and hair. The hair and make up can tie in the look or really create the camp factor and truly everyone was just worried about looking pretty when this was the one time for people to just look weird, abstract, out-of-the-box.

Sorry but your comment shows bias to match up with the other Harry hate comments. Bet u wouldnt say that if someone else wore that outfit..",6년 전(수정됨),0,
@Parker4738,Selena Millieu You have no idea who I am so I’m not sure why you presume to know. Also the fact you keep pushing the idea I have a problem with the model of this outfit says more about you and your motive. My criticism was of the brand and quality.

@applepie6701," @Parker4738  I dont have to push any idea when its quite obvious your critique of Gucci's workmanship has more to do with the particular model who wears it. How come I dont see your so called fashion tailoring critique on their latest runway shows? I suscribe & read all the comments.   Nah it says more about your bias bc you were right along with these hate harry comments. Funny thing is ive seen ppl who dislike Harry all of a sudden cant stand the Brand he représents.

I have a problem with people with a platform (or not, frankly) spreading the message that if a man cheats on you, you should drug him and hire a trans woman to rape them ( https://youtu.be/CxNP5gK-qR8 she explains this herself here). She has said out of her own mouth again, that she would not have a relationship with a woman,so I don't know where she is ""bi"". Saying that her sister is a lesbian is the equivalent of white people saying that they have black friends when they do racist shit, which Cardi has also done. What bothers me the most is that she has never said she is sorry that she used those slurs or that she regrets it. Never apologized. Never addressed the people she has hurt and never took responsibilty for her actions. What's not clicking for you?

He mentioned how everyone was expecting him to show up in something crazy, colorful, and sparkly, so taking the more diluted style was much more unexpected. While the camp in harry’s look is much more subdued i think it is still there with the waistline of his pants reaching his chest and the homage to victorian styles with the ruffles. i agree he could have done more but i think it still fits the theme",6년 전,6,

@ActuallyAnanya," @Heevoice  that was many years ago, I believe he's grown since then. I don't think a no homo guy would be going around trying to kiss his bandmates or talking about touching their asses on variety shows. Not saying he's gay necessarily, but I think he's gotten over his toxic masculinity by now. Not to mention him having to be careful with his image considering he's a major celebrity in China and works directly for the Chinese government, so he might not take those risks. Regardless, we don't know whether this was his choice, considering this was a custom suit from Valentino and he was probably just wearing what they gave him.",6년 전,0,
