Cindy Sherman was a great example for mocking exactly this notion publicly and trying to even trap critics into writing over the top reviews and articles over her photographs with the wildest interpretations, when her actual intention was even not really clear to herself, she just arranged random things and hit the shutter. That is why she deserves so much respect aside from her own body of work in my opinion, she exposed this MOMA kind of narrative for what it is: pretentious and narcissistic.",5년 전,2,

And so tragedy itself - which is merely a revelation of our vulnerability can't be regarded as evil. It's just a condition of existence. And so it's necessary to distinguish the conditions of existence from evil before you can even address the problem. And I think what that means to some degree is you should not blame on the relationship between the finite and the infinite  The terrible failings of humanity that can be laid directly at the feet of human beings. So earthquakes aren't evil, and cancer is not evil, and mental illness isn't evil, predators aren't evil. They just are part of the way things are. But there are certain categories of human action that are definitely outside the parameters of mere tragedy and those are the things we really have to get a handle on.",5년 전,0,

@lechat8533,"Lina Garibay Let me enlighten you. People in those times ate natural food, they weren`t sweating as much nervous sweat as nowadays and their clothes were made of natural material. If people were clean and washing daily their bodies didn`t smell unpleasant, even after hard work. And there is one more thing. Miners have always been known to be the cleanest workers because they had to wash off all the black coal dust daily in order to look acceptable. Their best suits were probably hanging for at least one week in the open air before being worn again. I`m convinced that these boys, when they arrived at the dance, were smelling mainly of soap. And after some dances, their odor of soap would have been accompanied by a pleasant, healthy odor of sweat packed with male hormones that told every female more about them than any deodorant or perfume ever could. The wars changed all that because they mentally crippled whole generations. They brought depression and nervousness to society and because of lack of money, more and more unnatural materials have been introduced to the new way of living. Our sweat began to change because it carried all the toxins from our bodies and it exposed the mental health people were trying to hide from one another. So, industrial deodorants were invented and are still booming today. They help us to cover up who we really are and their smell confuses the opposite sex and all people we come in contact with. So, no, these boys didn`t need a deodorant like we do today.",5년 전,0,

Strangely incongruent with the pastoral landscape? The landscape is blurred so it's hard to talk about the incongruity with it.  It's strange but by their feet it looks like Ewald, and August were prepared to move, but by their canes it looks like they want to stay still. Otto looks the opposite; resting on his back feet but the cane positioned like he would push off ...   August's cane is different than the other two's canes; not just because of the lack of the plate, but also because it looks curvy. (I wonder if those were their canes.) It looks that he also was the only one who had a tie, and the only one who showed both his hands ... and the only one who died.  ""Their heads are sort of being cut off by the horizon line, which turns out to be tragically resonant ..."" Well, only one of them was ""decapitated"" by the WW1.

@tamarrajames3590,"It is very likely that they were actively searching for Wives at their ages, which would account for each of the three distinct attitudes of these men. Opportunities to meet and impress unmarried women was a rare event back then, and most were dance parties to which the young would come from miles around...maybe someone new had arrived, or a child was finally old enough to go to the parties...maybe the girl who danced with you a lot last dance would be there, and interested. So many possibilities.  The false devil may care attitude of the one smoking and standing in a jaunty pose with his cane thrust forward (hoping to charm a young lady with his wit and silver tongued phrases carefully memorized)...the middle man taking the strong silent type, (hoping a dash of mystery and the glance of a half lidded eye might attract the right lady.)...the nervous jitters of the first man, (thinking, what if no one wants to dance with me...and what if they do? What if my palms sweat? Perhaps this is his first dance and he fears making a fool of himself what if no one wants to dance with me?) He interests me because I see two plausible stories for him. The second story is that he has his eye on a lady he has danced with previously. Perhaps there is a ring in his pocket, and he intends asking her to be his Wife, he is in a turmoil of conflicting thoughts (should I ask her? What if she says no? What if her Father forbids it? I should have brought her flowers. Do I have enough to take a Wife and have children? Is she promised to another?)  They are dressed like city-slickers...tight collars, fancy suits, they each had a scrubbing today. To each of them, these clothes are like a costume...they are like the peacock, ready to show off, hoping to attract a mate in their splendour. The costume gives them the freedom to not be a miner for this one day, or an office clerk...freedom to see themselves as handsome and dapper at least for this one evening. Men’s formal wear has always been  their plumage...even when it is often black tuxedo with elegant accessories, mostly because it makes them FEEL different, and that gives them the courage and confidence to approach young ladies, ask them to dance, and then attempt to develop a conversation...keeping the other men away from their chosen ones.

A photo of three rather well-dressed young men posing along a dirt road.  This is the reason he could name it ""three farmers on the way to a dance"" … because the photo isn’t at all about who or what they were or even what they did for a living. All of that was excluded for what is merely a composition the photographer considered attractive. Above all else, the photo is about the only person there who is not visible.

This went on until after WW2, emigration was still common in my parents' generation.

@doc-uzziel-holiday6250,"Very interesting story behind the picture. This reminds me of this picture I have of Doc Holiday. This is the only known picture of the actual man that was, ""Doc Holiday"". Most people just think of modern western movies, with Val Kimler playing Doc in Tombstone, yet most do not even know that he was a dentist when he met Wyatt Earp, and joined in helping Mr. Earp in finding an outlaw, leaving his dental practice behind.     Most also do not know , and are very unaware that Doc Holiday also was in love with his first cousin, both of their first love. The girl was forced to join a convent at 16 and the guilty Doc Holiday, headed West, to leave that lost love behind, along with the public scandal of loving his first cousin in the East.  Again, this picture does not say these things but he, the real Doc Holiday was a real human being, and right or wrong, he did do some amazing things despite having Tuberculosis and risking his life gambling and shooting his six guns in the Wild West.     Again, thank you for your storytelling and look forward to one about Doc Holiday sometime, as my knowledge of him is only slight, yet i admire him for being a human being, and bringing justice to those who had lost loved ones to many murderers in the West the Doc Holiday and Wyatt Earp and the ""good guys"" of the West , civilized the outlaws that murdered with impunity before they met up with them.

@MrPoupard,It's just a photo of 3 good looking young men dressed upstanding in a field. Nothing more. Farmers? My arse. Farming in 1914 would've been a hard year round physical grind on people who started from a very young age and you can see clearly that these three  have neither the physical musculature nor even slightly worn faces of people used to  hard physical labour. I don't know whether it's typical or not but looking at the snapshot of other pics taken by the photographer I notice most if not all the subjects are men. Was there something else going in the photographer's head other than producing works of art?,6년 전,0,

@jfcaffrey22,"The first thing I noticed - which was never mentioned - were the men's sideburns. No single or married men [at that time] - whether farmer, miner or office worker - kept their hair and sideburns neat at all times. Each of their sideburns (and hair, no doubt) were carefully cut by a barber - perhaps even the same barber - and within 24 hours of the dance.  In my judgement, this dance was a big deal. The haircuts, suits, hats and walking sticks - together indicate this. If this was just ""some dance"", then there must have been dances frequently - but, I doubt it, given the size of the communities and the lack of access to them.  Yes, one can judge some part of a person's personality from a single photo - but not all parts. This photo was carefully altered by the photographer in the darkroom - to deepen the darkness of their suits and provide alternating shades of gray in the background - to contrast against the black and white details with the men. All elements mentioned were present in the original photo, yet the photographer enhanced these elements to an even more pleasing degree. The net effect of his work is - Art - which all recognize.  There is even more to say about the taking of this photo, particularly in the 1-2 hours before. But the exact details may be undiscoverable. Cheers",6년 전,0,

@Professor-Rook," michelle Welsh  Sounds to me like we may have generational differences as well as national differences, Michelle. You called it ""uni"" and ""year 12"" so I'll guess you're from Britain or Aus/NZ whereas I'm from the US. But here goes.  I started work young as well, part time at 16; I didn't have the social connections necessary to get jobs when I was too young. None of my parents' friends did that kind of work, and, living in a rich area, none of my friends worked or even needed to work, and their parents didn't work at companies that employed people illegally. Then I began working full time at 17 when I joined the military and I've worked full time ever since. I've done quite a few different kinds of jobs, from driving commercial vehicles to security to delivering pizzas to construction and retail management. I worked my way through college, too, but it is literally impossible here to pay for school by yourself, especially considering that I was handling all my bills myself with zero help from anyone else. I have a back-breaking load of student loan debt that I'm trying to pay off. If you paid for college as you went, it's because you're either from an earlier generation in the US that wasn't on the receiving end of 50 years of wage stagnation or you're from a nation other than the US where education is either free or heavily subsidized. I have been homeless in the past, living out of my car while trying to make ends meet.  You say historian and educator ""sounds extremely easy"" without knowing how things work in the system here. Full-time, tenure-track faculty make excellent salaries with great benefits, of course. Associate faculty, like myself, work part-time at multiple institutions, usually one class taught per institution, for less pay per class taught than full-time faculty and we receive no benefits at all, which means I have to pay for medical, dental, and vision healthcare needs out of my own pocket.   Do I really sound like someone who is lazy and entitled to you? Or did you make assumptions based on ignorance of the situation?  On a side note, what did you hope to gain by barking words full of judgment at some random stranger online who you don't even know? What did you think you'd accomplish by trying to insult me?",5년 전(수정됨),23,
@Professor-Rook," michelle Welsh  Growing up in a rich area, as a lower middle class family, of course sides with my argument. My family wasn't having financial problems, but I surely was. I did move to a cheaper area to live when I was on my own, but it still ate up a huge portion of my income. At least 50% of my income has always gone to my housing.  Before WW1, those boys absolutely did not have it harder than you and I did. Sure, they worked hard, but they were all paid living wages. All of them could easily afford a suit. I couldn't afford buying a suit until very recently, after my wages increased after I received my master's degree.   Think about it. The difficulty of your life, how hard you have had to work, is proof of my side of the argument. Past generations did not have to work NEARLY so hard as you have to achieve what you have achieved. Nearly every job paid a living wage, and only one income was needed to support a family and pay for college for the wage earner AND the kids.  I didn't say staying in school was harder. I said children are REQUIRED to stay in school by law; they do not generally have the option of deciding to work, so claiming ""kids today are so entitled and lazy, all they have to do is go to school!"" is a useless argument. They MUST go to school, and doing what is required of them is proof of neither laziness nor entitlement.",5년 전,13,

@Squirreltasticqueen," michelle Welsh     gen Z is even more socialist and aware of the injustices perpetrated by shitty systems than millennials. Oops guess you'll have even more reasons to bitch.   You can continue to be a bitter fool all you want but at the end of the day your feelings about how hard you worked doesn't accurately reflect the broken systems that perpetuate inequality that harm thousands of not millions of others.   Instead of actually learning about these systems you just whine and bitch about how you had to work so hard and that makes you superior, because kids these days are working to better the world and don't have to be selfish pricks utterly lacking empathy for others as they crawl their way through sludge for basic human dignity like you. It's pathetic that you are proud of having to had to work illegally, your job as a child was to go to fucking school and instead of seeing illegal child labor as a problem you just wear it as honor.  Your use of retard also is a huge red flag that working hard did nothing to make you a good person.

@donnaroberts5932," Alexander Supertramp  Hi yes I realise that was vague at best.. But what I meant was that the sentiment ""HE was, however briefly, a human being"" to me highlighted the invisibility of women throughout history. Women did plough those fields whilst their sons, fathers, husbands were away. Infact we saw a clip of women in factories making bombs but even if the men did get back from war. The women would have gone right back to the kitchen or the bedroom to make bread or babies. Not much credit given throughout history for their sacrifice pain & loss. No voice no appreciation no acknowledgement of their importance or existence let alone validity. It's so sad that the only acknowledged hero's in history are men. Shine on friend..

And I think that would be a better call as one of his descendants said that he worked in the office and hated to get dirty.      At the end of the story you said that they were not metaphors or statistics but humans.  I don't really think people look at him that way except for people like the guy narrating the video or people who like to think they are more artsy and there fore better then the rest.    I would have to close and say if you want the world to open up to art, then quit trying to make something into what you want it to be instead of what it really is,  Just a fricking picture that more then likely they asked to have taken of them to celebrate their friendship.",6년 전,0,

@noticias0915,"The Phillip Roth quote really makes me think how the hindsight which historiography benefits from and which (in a sense) contributes to the chronological events coming off as inevitable can be said to in a sense contribute to a sort of fatalism which ppl might typically pitch about the ‘human experience/condition’ and it’s related agonies..it’s not the same as say saying ~‘the farmers..or Germany/ German ppl had free will to choose to responsibly avoid WWI’ or saying that the persons who would participate in such events were delimited in their options b/c of how their priorities were not always compatible with what was in their circle of control . For example, not coming from an aristocratic family which would likely avoid most of the more violent involvement than say a rural area person who was more at risk of going hungry b/c of the politics they weren’t involved in and hence more likely to put themselves at risk and/or be pressured into front-line infantry. Nowadays we have an arguably improved understanding of classism even more improved than what German ppl ~100 yrs ago did but does that mean we can responsible overcome the attitudes that homelessness, underemployment and risking your life at work even b/c of say asbestos in walls rather than gunfire is inevitable any more than the German persons from ~100 years ago who didn't have the mass access of information like the internet?.  4:37-4:38 Me too :)",6년 전,0,

@SueMead,"I'm usually loathe to turn such tales into my own situation but I would be pleased if you will indulge me. Move on if you aren't interested in my take on the terrible events here in Christchurch just thirty-plus hours ago. I am not attempting to offend. Just a comparative post to the wonderful imagery and analysis provided in the above video.  Yesterday, an average early autumn day here in Christchurch, New Zealand,  three youthful men that were very different but very much the same, to these jaunty fellows in the above image, attending a service and community connection of their peers at their local mosque. They were welcomed by a lovely man, whom, as always, greeted them and everyone else with a simple, ""welcome brother"" or ""welcome sister"". They nodded and smiled and after having removed their footwear, entered the main gathering area. A few minutes later, after almost all those that would normally attend were preparing for the service, a man walked in alone. The older man at the door again greeted this fellow with a ""welcome brother"". This man, however, was not the spiritual sibling of any of those in al noor mosque .   The spiritual siblings I describe will never walk together, talk together or grow up together. The gentle fellow that greeted them at the door will never greet another person at the entrance to any mosque, or home.  Though I do not wish to breath energy into this despicable mans situation, I need to share that the murderous Brenton Tarrant will continue to breathe, communicate and live here in New Zealand, as a guest of the New Zealand taxpayer through the prison system. I'm not one to condone murder at the hands of the state. Even now. I don't even want Tarrant's existence to be more painful than anyone else here. Although I can't help but wonder if he considered that his situation would be a lot better than if he had perpetrated such a disgraceful act in Indonesia, the nation with the largest Islamic population on the planet, and is just a few short hours flight from here. Not to mention even less distance from his homeland of Australia.  I don't know what is right for this despicable individual. I do know that I cannot change his actions or fix what is very broken in this world. Not on my own.  The world is full of broken people. How do we fix things?",6년 전,0,

@vinny142,"7:50 ""He was, however briefly, a human being""   As where the 80(!) Million others who where mobilised in WW1.     I get annoyed at the melancholy and the way people look for symbolism in a picture who'se only importance is that we know who they where and what happened to them. if there was no WW1, you would not give this photo a second look.If this photo was not taken by that partcular photographer, you would not even look at it the first time. Their heads are above the horizon. yes, that happens autmatically when the photographer is about one head shorter than his subjects. That's not symbolic, it's normal. The dance is ofcourse the biggest symbol, although nobody would ever describe war as a dance. People with melancholy hindsight do. As dance with death... If that's the comparison then you desperately need to learn about what went on in WW1. it was no dance, it was slaughter. 40 million dead, that's 27.000 a day...that's one every three seconds. To call it a dance with death is to be a complete piece of shit with no sense of reality.   It's only human to romantisise the story behind the photo but the fact is that pictures like this exist for all of the other 40 Milion dead. They where all just going about their lives when a couple of arseholes who did not have a farting clue about anything where too busy expanding their economies that they collectively decided to fight over it. Well, to make their people fight over it. 40 Million dead becuase a handfull of incompetent idiots could not work things out....",6년 전,2,

I can see my great grandparents fleeing Lithuania and Poland ahead of the early Communists.  I can feel their trepidation of what is to come.  I can smell the sea as they crossed, I can see Lady Liberty and the lines at Ellis Island.  They left their family and friends behind and settled finally in America.

And they rarely looked like the German Übermensch that the Nazis were keen to portray in the media. According to Wikipedia, Sander's photographic plates from his book ""Face of our time"" were seized together with the book and destroyed. His studio in Cologne, which he left in 1942 to work in the countryside, was destroyed in an Allied bombing raid in 1944.

Looking at old photographs is such an enigmatic and piquing experience that has recently become one of the many things I enjoy doing (usually when I'm procrastinating). The people we see in these old photos have so much shape and form to them that we could never know, yet we have such vivid glimpses of them to make us wonder who these people were. What were they feeling when the photograph was taken? What were they thinking before the photo was captured? What happened to them in the many minutes, days, even years after that one moment of their lives was sequestered away into film?

@johnfitzgerald7618,"Your analysis of this photograph’s place in history is excellent, and to my mind is the true work of art here, far more interesting and creative than Sander’s photo. Bravo.  Your analysis, though, deals with historical rather than artistic considerations. Sander obviously did not intend this photograph to be a meditation on the horrors of the of a war that had yet to begin or on history. He took this photograph as part of an explicit project to illustrate archetypes of seven categories – and numerous sub-categories – of people into which he divided society. He wanted to “speak the truth in all honesty about our age and the people of our age.”  No one ever questions why he wanted to do that, or how he expected to do that by taking photos of non-random samples of farmers – or, as you point out, non-farmers. An archetype is a perfect example, and you don’t find an archetype of a farmer by taking a photo of two miners and an office-worker.  As for formal characteristics, you do mention how the horizon runs through the subjects’ necks, but as indicative of events no one had gone through yet. That’s certainly a valid observation, but since the events hadn’t happened yet I suspect that if Sander did that deliberately it was for another reason, a photographic one. The rest of the men’s dark-suited forms sink into their dark background, but their heads stand out against the lighter sky. Perhaps Sander did this to create photographic tension that would make it easier to take in the photograph quickly; in a portrait of three similarly dressed men posed against a similarly dark background the only other tension is with the frame, and there’s not a lot of that here.  Or maybe his intention was both photographic and thematic – to call attention to the men’s faces to point out that they were individuals despite the mass-produced clothes that make them look like members of a team. That would, however, be inconsistent with his intention to discover archetypes.  Or maybe it was adherence to the rule of thirds, or an accident.   This doesn’t seem to me to be one of his best photographs; it’s too murky for me, and reminds me of advertising for menswear. There is, however, no objective standard of photographic excellence by which to judge my judgment, so I can’t claim that I’m right or that anyone else is wrong. It just seems to me that a critique of a photograph is better when it includes some discussion of why the photograph was taken (if that is known) and how. Sander made artistic decisions in taking this photo and whether they were good ones is at least an interesting question.

Oh, God! We gave our lives To that damned ascent; we were too busy Covering our tracks and freeing captives  To look up. Imagine our misery When one day we caught glimpse of horizon; We looked over our shoulders, bemused; He shot us, then, and we stood there, frozen In that moment, our surroundings diffused: It was just a plain, a muddy expanse; And we? We were on our way to the dance.",6년 전,35,

@CitizenSnips69,"This is why i never got into ""fine"" art and literature. You guys read too much into this shit. It's a picture of 3 young men in suits, going to a dace. Their heads are cut off by the horizon, WW2, dance they can't see.... ""3 farmers,"" but they weren't farmers? I'd call it ""3 males"" but the art crowd might get hissy at me for ""assuming"" their gender. Idk how to put this into words, but... Any conclusions you draw from these things are usually meaningless things your brains assign to the photo, in a sense. They have meaning, but they're just nice coincidences that you give meaning where there often is none. Just enjoy the picture for what it is. No need to make some ""intellectual"" shit up to muddy up the real story.",6년 전,15,
@CitizenSnips69,"Hmm. Thought most people who understand literature and the arts would understand how to argue. Seems like you would try to use evidence or any kind of reasoning to try to refute my point, instead of the ""lots of people say that and it's stupid"" tactic.   I'll be doing stem if you need me.

@sirrathersplendid4825,"Andrew, I used to think studying Art, specifically Art History, was useless, exactly because of vids like this one. Reading between the shadows in the picture, waxing lyrical while attempting to “see inside the mind” of the persons photographed. It’s 90% hogwash. But then you have the 10 percent that is factual: identities of the men, dating of the photograph, the fashions being worn, who these men were and what became of them, and also why the photo works as a composition. I’m now an art historian (though I still think most of this vid is hogwash.)",6년 전,0,
