@judishbluish6006,"I concur with Tim, I'm glad that Jordan Peterson exists , I am grateful for this show right here excellent show Tim, I bet you were stoked, Jordan Peterson is a light bearer, a Warrior of truth, I love him on so many levels. I thank God, and the Universe for his role here on earth and I pray that he get a bit of a break or relief or whatever delights him in reward for all his hard work. He contributes so much to this existence at times I feel he is underrated. Yet I admire how when he's complimented he wears it well instead of the fake meekness that a lot of personalities demonstrate. I applaud his genuine and his awareness of his worth, bless that man . His family is ..I won't say lucky, because luck runs out..but privileged to be around him and be loved by him, and I believe that they themselves are amazing individuals aswell.",1년 전,0,

@meganeitel1981,I dont agree with all your opinions or beliefs but i dont need to. I respect your honesty and input and i value others perspectives. I just sent my 19 and 25 yr old daughters some of hour videos and encouraged them to give you a chance to see how your insight is in large part very accurate on important matters i feel. I hope that they see you as a tool to help them with there trauma and healing and show that most people have the ability to improve there own lives if they fi the work and really look at themselves and the choices that lead you to certain destinations. I hope they see they can empower themselves and start now if they will allow there minds to process new and different ways of seeing there life and future and build n grow as young women by dealing with the bad n dark areas in there life to see the lesson or what you can manifest if you think with intention and actively keep working on themselves akways. They will surpass what took me 43 yrs to learn if they will see how much we gain a lot of times from others and there perspective than we do our own. It opens your reality and gives you more control to change your own life and desires and become a more educated well informed person who is more capable to handle life and goals and understanding the more you listen to others. I mean all walks of life from the lunch lady to a college educated scholar. Seek out new experiences outside your class and race and culture. The more you seek n challenge yourself the more clarity n wisdom n peace and answers i have achieved in my experience. It took me till i was in my late thirties to slow down and truly seek out knowledge and challenge myself especially to grow abd evolve by doing the work. I hope they give you a fair assessment. I respext your perspective and honesty. I agree with a lot of your input and respect you despite any differences we have for being true to yourself and sharing your knowledge and views. I think its important to acknowledge those that are trying to seek the abswres to lifes greatest questions especially than live in a ignorant state of mind of compliance and acceptance and do what society demands. Some people never truly care to ask themselves anything about life or themselves that could change there reality. Most people i think sre scared to face these tough topics and dig deeper for a answers. Hopefully ive taught my girls to question everything. Its part of our purpose on Earth i feel. To always be growing and learning and thinking to be a independent thinker and not a sheep. Its scary and it takes courage and risk and patience but its not a waste of a life. Ill never be famous or well known like yourself im fairly certain but i know that ive become proud of my growth and thirst for knowledge and always challenging myself to see if i can achieve things i once thought was not possible. We are onmly limited by the limits we set for ourselves. I feel im lucky that i finally stopped being my own worst enemy by my regrets and addictions that stunted my ability to seek more from my life. I wasted a lot of years being ignorant and controlled by poison. I havent found a drug i didnt abuse and enjoy. But when i had kids and my husband died i knew i had an obligation to not allow my children to make the same poor choices if i could help it. So i lead by example. Ive literally changed who i am especially the past twelve years. I challenged my kids to make smarter choices so they didnt turn out like me. I never did drugs around them or with them. Its paid off and its the most important purpose i have for my life. To raise these girls to be more than me. I dont mind being there example of what not to do. I know they both have accessed there dad n i expectations and then some. I have gained so much too though. I feel God had a plan for me. Thats why im still alive when so many times i should of not survived my reckless life. Its cause of those girls that i do everything. The bonus is i have found myself and changed so much that i feel like God spared me for some reason too. Why have i bedn so lucky i say sometimes. Ive buried so many i love because of drugs and wasted potential that few see. Do you know what percent of addicts stay clean? Its tragically a very small percentage. But i did it. I will always be proud of that. I have goals and dreams and its been 25 yrs since i had those. I am excited about the future. I want to go back to college and pay it forward. It makes all my pain n struggle have purpose if i can help anyone along the way. Im 43 and i am finally going somewhere and i feel so blessed. Thanks for listening. If you read this. I dont get a lot of praise or seek out compliments often but i want you to know youve been helping me for for four years now. Thanks for being a spokesperson for the masses. You inspiire me and i appreciate all you do. Your changing lives. We need more positive influences in this World like yourself.   Much love Megan - Illinois,1년 전,0,

@MengzisDisciple,"People using psychedelics/LSD/DMT are just taping into the insula system of the mind, which naturally produces DMT itself.  Which is the same area that schizophrenia comes from when a person damages their amygdala system.  So are we going to accept that schizos are actually talking to entities who are really there in their mind--or are we going to accept that the entities encountered are just produced in the same area of the mind that is connected with dreams and awareness (serotonin in the insula creates melatonin), as the insula is responsible for sleep cycles and releasing hormones to make us tired--notice I say ""us"" and not it (it stays aware..).    Thus this awareness is the subconscious itself--which does control homeostatic states in both the mind and in the rest of the body and in that emotions are connected to dreams, then this is the area that produces and creates our dreams as well.  The area connected with breathing, heart rate, pleasure/pain response, the ""background"" feeling of the mind itself.   So taking DMT just allows this ""dream"" center to be activated while in a waking state.    The problem with taking LSD/DMT is the possibility of damaging the amygdala system which is the cause of schizophrenia itself (where too much stress in a traumatic event, like the death of a parent, can lead to schizophrenia).  Where if one reads the comments below, many will talk of this side-effect.  That and deep depression, as manic-depression is also associated with the insula--and yes, taking substances that simulate too much serotonin will produce mania.    People using psychedelics just doing lab experiments in their own minds with chemicals they don't even have any knowledge of. Notice the ""state of union with God"" here--a common claim by schizophrenics.    ""Emotional awareness. Almost all recent imaging studies of emotion report joint activation of the AIC and the ACC in subjects experiencing emotional feelings, including maternal and romantic love, anger, fear, sadness, happiness, sexual arousal, disgust, aversion, unfairness, inequity, indignation, uncertainty, disbelief, social exclusion, trust, empathy, sculptural beauty, a 'state of union with God', and a hallucinogenic state (induced by ayahuasca). Thus, the AIC is activated not just in association with subjective feelings from the body, but apparently with all subjective feelings.""  How do you feel — now?

@thegemologist9574,"Happ-i-ness   A good thing; a measure of satisfaction. (See also WELFARE.) Underlying most economic theory is the assumption that people do things because doing so gives them Happ-i-ness.  People want as much happ-i-ness as they can get. However, the more they have, the less difference an additional unit of happ-i-ness will make - there is diminishing MARGINAL happ-i-ness.  Happ-i-ness is not the same as trying to be happy, a political philosophy based on achieving the greatest happ-i-ness of the greatest number.  A tricky question is how to measure happ-i-ness. MONEY does not (entirely) capture it. You can get richer without becoming more satisfied. So some economists have tried to calculate broader measures of happ-i-ness. They have found that people with jobs are much happier than unemployed people.  Low INFLATION also makes people happier. Extra INCOME increases happiness a bit, but not much. In many countries incomes have risen sharply in recent years, but national surveys of subjective well being have stayed flat. Within countries, comparing people across the income distribution, richer does mean happier, but the effect is not large.  Married people are often happier than single people; couples without children happier than couples with; women happier than men; white people happier than black people; well-educated people happier than uneducated people; the self-employed happier than employees; and retired people happier than economically active people. Happ-i-ness generally decreases until you are in your 30s, and then starts rising again. Other economists are dismissive of such studies. They argue that people are rational maximisers of their own happ-i-ness, so, by definition, whatever they do maximizes their happ-i-ness.",1년 전,0,

@auriuman78,"Psychedelics and the Bible, together or separately? I couldn't imagine reading Ezekiel whilst under the influence of mushrooms...😮 Or any other parts. I mean I'm kind of kidding there, the visions and all 😅  I've had a couple pretty incredible ""heroic"" experiences with mushrooms, truly controlled and directed sessions. I will never flinch at telling anyone that I've been taught many important aspects of my personality that were hindering me as a human by means of seriously high dose mushroom experiences.  Regardless of the power they hold, and the positive change they have had in my life, I still am concerned that they fall into the category at 1 Corinthians 6:9,10. There is a list of practices that bar you from the kingdom of God, and one is the practice of sorcery (sometimes druggery, others magic, etc).  That root Greek word it comes from, is pharmakeia. Anyone with a shred of English ability should recognize the similarity of this root word to another English word that we all know the meaning of. I mean, pharmacy \ pharmakeia... I can't say it better than that.  I'll never tell you that you are going to hell if you do shrooms, man, not ever. This is all for me only, coming from a place of serious and sincere spiritual progression. It just scares me, regardless of the immense positive effect that shrooms had on me, because I'm not the judge or lawmaker, you know?  When I consider 2 Corinthians 11:14 alongside it, in which Satan and his ministers disguise themselves as angels of light, etc... I can't help but think of the great spirit light of the desert, the spirit of the forest, the great teacher, you name it they all refer to spiritual things or teachers. I've even encountered some of the ""entities"" that reside in that beyond, they're real and they're there man, you'll never convince me otherwise.  So I guess I'm just sharing my knowledge and my own personal conviction regards the two and adding mushrooms to the Bible or vice versa. I'm not saying anyone's going to hell if they practice shtoomery, I once was a very seasoned psychonsut in the psilocybin realms. These are just my thoughts and fears surrounding what mushrooms taught me about myself, what I've learned by reading the Bible and the incredible potential for psychedelics to be held up as a ""panacea"", which it isn't, though they are immensely powerful.  I don't think Satan has any proclivities whatsoever to do something immensely good for humans in order to trick us into doing something that defies God's thinking and wishes. That sounds like exactly the sort of thing Satan would do to us, it's the same thing he did to Eve in the garden.  As much as I once revered the shroom as an incredibly helpful tool that brought me out of a very dark place, they scare me now because of the possible source of their power. Demons may not be physically on earth now, but once upon a time they were here on earth having taken human form, with powers beyond any human, power to create or twist a creation into something as powerful as a sort of spiritual gateway like shrooms. One that leads into a realm we do not belong, even though the effects are overwhelmingly positive on the whole, at the surface level.   Best wishes and if you're on the road to recovery via a psychedelic treatment plan then so be it man 😊 I'm happy for yoiu that you're getting a help that you've probably been seeking for years and finally found. I know, because I've been there. I just can't not say that out loud though, when the two are mentioned together, the Bible (God) and psychedelic treatments. It personally scares me and if I were not to say something, I feel I would be held accountable. 😊  Much love to all, no judgement here whatsoever. I wouldn't have made my way back to God via study of the Bible if I hadn't taken the shroom journey that I did. I just don't think I can recommend it with a good conscience.❤",1년 전(수정됨),1,

@Neon_White,"What you may not realize is, you are full of 'entities', all sorts of functions in your subconscious mind that act just like consious beings if they are seperated from the whole, which psychedelics can do.  I had a trip with Salvia one time where I came to be in this massive stadium-like place, full of all these creatures of all sorts that were just watching me, countlessly vast numbers of them.  As reality reasserted itself, I realized that the stadium was my body and the things looking at me were my own cells; a host of little guys watching me turned into my skin, like a sea of tiny weird little people covering my entire body.  You really have no way to know whether the entities you saw were apart from yourself, but hey man, believe whatever you find useful to believe; it's your life.  But you might want to keep in mind that religion uses demons and devils as scarecrows that sit on the fence that's meant to keep the sheep under their control.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

@hollieooo,"Holy shit. Jordan Peterson. You are so good: you are such a good, good man. However, you are laboring under a fundamental misunderstanding of maleficence that could be cleared up with one word: LEARN. You encountered a ""bad trip."" It's okay, it's not the end of the world. I can tell you FOR SURE that maleficence didn't mean you harm. Rather, in another world, it IS your teacher.  In the story of Cain and Able, one of the brothers offered valuable sacraments to his God expecting a blessing in return. He can't fathom why God turned aside all of his gifts and condemned him. Here is the question: who is the gift giver? All God asks is that you come unto GOD. He doesn't want your shit! Sit somewhere, and breathe like a mf'r and contemplate Goodness; rise above any natural thoughts you may have. Then. Simply. Meet God. Let it happen. (HUGE hint: God is NOT NOT NEVER CAN BE maleficence). A lot of people emphasize speaking TO God, the biggest hint I can give is to LISTEN. There is a place Beyond, and you can only get there from INSIDE. You will have peace, IF you are called. Jordan Peterson... I believe things have been taken from you for a REASON. You COULD be, and have the unique capacity to understand and transcend Everything. Think I'm speaking gibberish? Even before the Bible, there was the wisdom of God. Do as I say, and maybe we can talk someday. I would enjoy your newfound perspective, and how you read this from a different point of reference afterwards.  Cheers. - Everything (a nobody)",2년 전(수정됨),0,

In my opinion there are undeniable facts such as  this is a universe of opposites; light cannot exist without darkness. For there to be peace there must have been war.

@RobertBrownjr322,"It depends upon one thought towards what is wright in truth and yet  wrong in explanation. The level of impact upon anyone only becomes from ones belief and meanings upon what's wright and wrong truth or dare. There is no wright or wrong. Being within the experience with a clear explanation as to why one chose to answer in the way others may see wrongly doesn't make your explanation untrue. Ones explanations are  truthfully explained from the experience which is why one made that choice. That make you true. Ones unsatisfied ecceptance towards  an answer does not give someone else the authority to classify one as being a falsehood. Therefore, the bases of ones opinion towards an unsatisfied responds or answer will give another's belief towards the unsatisfied truth the power to over shadow the one point and that point is ""Was he who spoke in truth of thee experience through his or her explanation is wrong or considered a lie?

In continuances, how can one travel into someone else's home or space field of living to force  having your field of thoughts and reasonings be the foremost of important over he or she who's home and space you were invited into to receive the highest level of hospitality. From the being to the end of all that is spoken it showed that it all about you & your likes, dislikes, and your opinions towards faults of others which in logical turn expose your fault ful approach towards finding solutions. If your educational search and achievements were ignited from & by one's enteral wars with one's enter demons, when will the correct approach towards identifying the behaviors that invited the demons to seek and find a home within ones soul. I would like for you to approach and explain your ideologies from a different base other than the base that set forth the path you now traveled and became a master at explaining how your were defeated. To approach in another field of thought would cause one to understand that one must become master at another field of thought in order to reach the many in totality. Is it being stamped in concrete that one's opinion is what will last the test of time because it is form in concrete? Be mindful every form of material inexistent has a life span beginning and ending. Concrete has a 30 yr life span, is it being stated unknowingly that your ideologies will only last for 30 yrs? Who ideologies will transition following? This is where the ideologies of another mindset of thought is the necessary . To master one form of thought doesn't make one the master of all thoughts of battling one's enter wars. I respect you and I have learned much from you.

I know this is a long ass comment but trust me I bet you know at least one homie who fell for this stuff.  I’m talking about people who follow new agey Hindu-buddhist syncretic religious ideas where they end up believing in ridiculous pseduo-scientific models like synchronicities after having listened to one too many Duncan trussel podcasts or reading be here now. Also yes midnight gospel is a great show but the constant religious allusions on trussel’s podcast are honestly unbearable after multiple episodes.  One of the absolute worst parts about new age psychedelia is the belief that the power to change the world lies within fixing your individual outlook on the world (I can also talk about how  removing your dualistic veil, or at least recognizing it as being JUST THAT a veil. Destroying the boundary between me and you. Or, instead of becoming someone, it’s about becoming no one as ram dass has put it.) I can go into how that is actually pretty fucked up but that requires a longer essay.  Theres this idea of acceptance and complacency and getting right with god (or the dmt entities, or what ever supernatural spirit(S)) see this idea is dangerous af imo. We as Gen Z need to affirm our sense of free will and use it to change oppressive systems in THIS world. We do not need to flatter this narrative that everything is peace and love and it’s all ok. Our world do be pretty fucked up. We can change that but not if we are trying to appease inexistent deities who we can’t even confirm exists in THIS WORLD.  Whether u are right wing or left wing you have to admit. Late capitalism sucks ass. The state of our socio-economic climate and our actual climate (the one that keeps changing) is not going to get any better by us preaching inner enlightenment and feeling like it will all be ok in the end cuz there’s that safe and secure and loving dmt realm waiting for us after death.  Like I said psychedelics are great, they can be fantastic tools for creativity and have immense therapeutic medicinal use… but ironically these substances be breeding narcisists af who think they’ve seen the noumenal world or true reality or have finally cracked the code and seen thru the matrix. It’s ironic cuz these people love to talk about dissolving their ego, but just can’t help but fall into delusions of grandeur about their own divine path.

@AtheistAdam,"Creepy guy to interview. Don't trust him until you have read this... Jordan Peterson is worried about his reputation being ruined. He enabled legal threats against people who alleged that he acted with sexual impropriety.   Multiple allegations, not just one or two.   Allegations which he legally suppressed with threats.   All this while the sly fox talked as though he cares about free speech.   Should his defense of free speech apply to his accusers? I think so.  Let's see if they are willing to speak up — although his incel Nazi-loving following might scare them away.   He publicly claims that all cases against him were baseless. Let's hear the claims.  Imagine if he did cross boundaries with these clients. People who trusted him. People in his care.  What would that say about him?  Jordan Peterson was required to write a letter — assuring that he would increase his level of professionalism and improve his behaviour. There is proof.  Also, why did his work colleagues ask him to stop closing his door all the time?  They asked many times, according to Jordan. He also made it public that he has had many accusers — without talking about silencing them with legal threats. There is proof.   He knows that when people hear from his accusers it will raise red flags about his trustworthiness in respecting boundaries.  It might also put a different spin on MANY of his videos.  It might even encourage people to think more about his videos that discuss satanic daycare centres in Canada in the 80s. They were everywhere, he claims. Jordan Peterson just so happened to work in a daycare centre around that time. Just a coincidence?  Alarm bells are ringing.   A man who doesn't respect a young woman's boundaries is not the type of man that should be trusted to be working in a daycare centre.  Can we at least agree on that?  Maybe Jordan blames women for leaving their kids with him while they went off to work instead of being in the kitchen.  Maybe Jordan Peterson is a narcissistic Machevelian psychopath. A sly fox. The very creature he adores.   Those are the words he now uses to attack his critics. Soon he will be calling us cockroaches.   Explore his past. I dare you.  You would think that his devotees might be interested in that but nobody likes to see their guru being attacked.   His following reminds me of the Scientologists who unquestionably followed the cult-leader L.Ron. Hubbard. A man who was also a master at BS.   We need to move past an era of cult-like worship. Look into his past. Go down that rabbit hole. I dare you.",2년 전,0,

(a marriage is a commitment between the couple). He contends that one should get a job in order to be healthy, whereas a moral person will suffer poverty rather than committing the crime of funding tyrants with their taxes for their own gain. Mahatma Gandhi understood this well and exhorted the people not to fund the British criminals enslaving the people. The slave system growing around you now is as a direct result of the population committing the crime of usury and funding criminals for Centuries. If you fund these these tyrants into power, don't complain when they enslave you. Peterson conflates the opposing notions of religious and spiritual.

@TruthSeeksM3,"The first time I ate cubensis mushrooms, It changed me for the better, I'm literally swelling with tears as I recall that experience.  The fear, low self esteem, self-doubt and every feeling of worthlessness that was beaten, shouted, threatened, intimidated, abused and traumatized into me from as far back as I can remember- 3-4 years old, just seemed to dissolve. It was like when you toss an Alka seltzer tablet into a gallon of warm water.  Walls were vaporized, dams were breached and the waters flowed, bridges were materialized over these flowing waters. It was f*cking beautiful!!  I was free, for the first time in those 19 years of life, I felt truly free.  I can truly, truly and honestly say that I felt what Love was, because I became Love and suddenly realized that is what I always had been, Unconditional Love.  That's why I was always the scapegoat, the whipping boy, the easy target.  I was made aware that I endured all that suffering, not because I was the self-hating flaws of character and unhealed traumas they all projected onto me, but it was because I was blameless and divine, pure empathy, hope and kindness, I was everything that they were lacking, everything they were not. I was like that little pup that gets kicked around and starved physically/mentally/spiritually, yet still comes around, sits next to and tries to love and comfort that same abusive monster when it recognizes their sorrow.  It wasn't me, it was never me that was the problem and I didn't deserve that abuse, or the bag of guilt and trauma that I had been carrying around everywhere until that point.  So I set it  down right then and there, it wasn't my bag to carry, not my load to bear.  The following weeks were a series of setting boundaries and burning bridges.  I was assertive and decisive, if you didn't help push or pull, you were brushed aside.  Where before I cowered and avoided conflict and confrontation in hope that the storm would quietly pass me by, I now would rise to look it dead in the eye and dare it to do its worst, like LT. Dan in Forrest Gump,  fear haf left the building. Of course it took a while longer to completely round up all those clever traumas and triggers that had hidden themselves in the recessed corners and darkest crevices of the shadow Self,  that the ego conveniently glazed over.   It is said that psychedelics are shortcuts to connecting with the higher consciousness or g_dhead, and therefore unearned wisdom/enlightenment.  But I don't agree with that wholly, because sometimes you have to do what you need to do for yourself. This knowledge can be attained if you pay attention to the omens and synchronicities that your Intuitive perception just can't seem to ignore.  They're attempting to lead you to water, it's up to you whether you choose to drink or not.   If you do choose to partake in these substances, do it mindfully, set an Intention.  Whether it's for recreation or healing of mind, body or spirit, or all three, declare what you wish to get from that experience, speak it. Respect and honor the organic and inorganic, for their part in the experience.  Maybe meditate for a few minutes on the purpose or goal of the experience.  You can heal, rid yourself of vices or habits that are detrimental to your being.  You can gain Wisdom and get answers that you may have, as long as those answers don't infringe on your free Will.

He's not afraid to criticize himself… he's not afraid to show emotion… he certainly is not afraid to say that he just does not know the answer... or hasn't found something - yet.  Ever the seemingly optimist, though - he  keeps looking.  There's not many people like that. This world is full of ""look at me, look at me - I have all the answers"" types.  Dr. Peterson is simply trying to make sense of this unfathomable thing we call life - and how the brain, outside influences, world views & individual experiences work in each human being. He starts with the human and works himself all the way through to ""the world"".  A very tough job. But, a job that someone has to love in order to even do it in the first place. Never mind the love he has for the people he's educating and helping.  No, I don't worship him. I worship Jesus Christ… But, I certainly highly respect him and believe he was meant to be heard. A.K.A.:  a gift from God!  There are many people that are extremely intelligent and they share truth(s) - or the seemingly unending search for it -   However, Dr. Peterson presents that knowledge (or search) with explanations, stories, writing books, conferences, speeches; all the while exhibiting humility and grace while anchoring himself (mostly) with what we call H0PE.  Why does a man kill himself? He loses hope. Without hope, we have nothing.  I think Dr. Peterson always brings hope with him - wherever he goes. If not for himself, surely for his listeners/readers.  Hope resonates in everything he does; in his educated writings, life lessons, experiences, beliefs; even the things he can't find or answer. He doesn't pretend to know everything. He is so down to earth, a child could relate to him.  If you have no hope, you have nothing. Not even hope of hope.  Thank you, Dr. Peterson; for all that you do. People have told you that you actually saved their lives. And when that was brought up in this video, you could feel his emotions through the screen… You could feel how much that means to him. That alone must make all his work extremely worthwhile.  Now, I may not have accurately described Jordan Peterson. If he were to see this, he may not agree with a thing or two. But that's what I see.

@Demosophist,"Also, Genesis is not about the ""creation of the universe"" as some great metaphysical vision. It is literally about the beginning of time for humans, which is specifically about a time when the main sequence star that we now call the sun backlit the planet Saturn in such a way as to produce a revolving crescent. This was the ""wheel of time"" during which humans could, for the first time in their evolution, mark the passage of time, and the time sequence moved from night time when the crescent was brightest and strongest to noon when it was weakest and dimmest (in a counterclockwise direction). And the ""waters above"" and the ""waters below"" were visually present as vast images in the sky during the ""polar configuration"" in which the planetary sequence was Saturn, Venus, Mars, and Earth all in line with the northern pole of the Earth.

@Demosophist,"The reason for the great stone megaliths all over the planet is simple. Things were falling from the sky. The megaliths and the smaller dolmens were protection, which is why you'll only find them in regions where there are no extensive cave systems. Moreover, moving such great stones was much easier then than now, because gravity is an artifact of charge, and is not a constant. When the charge of the Earth changed, the gravity changed with it. I was once skeptical of this conclusion, but it now makes sense. It wasn't that there was once I high tech culture before the flood, as Hancock suggests. There are no remains of such a high culture. It was gravity itself that changed.",2년 전,1,

@PeyoteKaiyote,Listened halfway and the sudden dismissing of Peterson advising against any type of hallucinogens with people with the history of schizophrenia in the family is HORRENDOUS. The problem with the fixation of psychedelics being a 'cure all' is blatantly denying the medical risk to individuals.  I was a psychedelic enthusiast and a dear friend of mine played 'doctor'  administer doses to me which resulted in a (luckily temporary) episode of psychosis.  Schizophrenic dormant genes exist and I am one of those people. Spending 2 decades of enthusiasm splintered to nothing when I personally faced the reality that too many people are claiming to be experts without medical credential.  It's sickening,2년 전,0,

A society which is being created by very vocal, manipulative groups, including academics that have created a discourse where openly expressing contrary views to theirs, results in  being branded and demonised with negative stereo types.  peoples ability to speak out and retain their free speech is being suppressed.   It’s time people put their heads above the parapet and find their voice and like Jordan speak out to value our customs, institutions, freedoms and stop reject the attacking of our western values, they may not be perfect but compared to China, Russia, Venezuela, Iran etc we perform better, treat women better and have laws to protect individual rights and we don’t mass execute our own people.",3년 전,0,

@TEXAS-SMITH,"I am always in wonder about savants inability to comprehend matters in The Bible. It is as if ... well Peterson said it himself. He can't wrap his head around it (my exact words not his). The mind is limited by the individual. If the mind cannot comprehend a thing it will certainly be confused about it. You can read The Bible with ordinary worldly thinking which will leave doubts and confusion, or you can read it spiritually as the Holy Spirit meant for it to be read. Only then will it be opened up.   The people were spoken to by Jesus in parables. If you only read The Bible with your savant brain it will be as a book of what seems like parables. It is a way to eliminate those who don't desire to grasp God with all of themselves. God is Spirit and desires those looking for him in Spirit and Truth. Not their own inner wisdom. I doubt anyone will give a hoot about my comment especially since it is so long and drab but there is a point to this.  You cannot comprehend Cain going scritzy (my own made up word), and killing Abel because you are looking at it with your own human perspective and not understanding the Wisdom of God about the Spiritual side of what happened. The Bible even explained it in that paragraph. Using my words it basically said Abels offering was acceptable. Because he chose the best of what he had to offer. Cain however, did not take his offering to God seriously and did not offer the best of what he had. If you understood it spiritually you would easily see that Cain didn't offer his best and KNEW he should have.  If you read other ancient manuscripts, they indicate there were other times Cain did not get his way because (in my words again) he was self centered. Abel on the other hand continually put his desires away and focused on what pleased God, but I digress. Cain decided within himself that he was sick and tired of his Mr. Goody Two Shoes twin which simply was another self centered move. If he had lifted God before himself within his own spirit and truthfully as his brother had done he would have been blessed but he chose to satisfy his own will and as you see he ended up cursed. Cain was not mentally dysfunctional. He was spiritually dysfunctional. He lied within himself about what he chose to give God. He was very well aware that what he decided to do was wrong.  If savants who think about the world through psychology, and even non savants (but in my own observances notice this in mostly genius types), would understand there is more, and bigger, things beyond our five senses and just plain chance...if they would spend time learning about, discerning, and focusing on Spiritual matters, then guessing with theories and calling them facts would begin to decline and REAL truths will begin to open up. Myths and lies would cease along with confusion and mysteries such as Peterson's son drawing or painting chaos, and order with no prior knowledge. These things would no longer appear so mysterious.  When Adam sinned, The biggest portion of how original man was made was taken away. The offspring of this partial man was also lacking. None of us have any idea what it's like to be a whole and complete human. Only Adam and Eve knew the difference. We are all Spiritually lacking God Himself. So we live, thinking we are right in what we believe. We get learning from Universities and read books from other incomplete men who appear so wise such as Carl Jung and as we learn we become smart in our own eyes but are dumb, poor, blind and lost because we ignore the missing link. We ignore the Spiritual that was lost. Today, many call God a myth. They ignore proven truths in The Bible and chase after untruth, false gods, and religion.  If you truly want answers to your mysteries, start seeking after that which Adam lost. There is nothing confusing about Cain unless you are relying heavily on psychology which does not consider we are incomplete.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

@Darlenejoy,"I hope it’s okay to add a biblical view along with Dr. Peterson’s true words.    Sacrifice was a symbol used for the promised future Messiah and His sacrifice for us. This was an important message God instituted to give people hope and salvation by faith in His gracious gift. (Future for them/past for us).  Thus, that He would “save” us. Because of His love and knowing without His intervention, we’d be lost as we cannot save ourselves.    Abel sacrificed a lamb (symbol of Jesus)  from his flock (as was the directive from God to maintain the message of the hope in His promise of each one could choose as provided in His promise of the future Messiah).    Cain’s sacrifice was produce from his own works of agriculture in the field.  (That’s like trying to save ourselves through our works which is impossible).    That is why Cain’s offering could not be accepted. It violated the message and skewed the way of salvation and to maintain the message of the coming Messiah.   Thus, it shows, as Dr. Peterson stated, that this rebelliousness in Cain brought further negative outcomes in his resentment which lead to murder.   This sacrifice versus our own works was first displayed in Eden.  They sewed fig leaves to try cover their (sin) failure but still felt guilt as shown by them hiding from God.  However, Jesus stepped in, the first “sacrifice” was made by His having to kill animal(s) (the first death on earth) and He covered/clothed them  with the animal skin symbolizing His covering us in His righteousness (which again symbolized His future remedy to rescue us from ourselves, our failings, our guilt).  Though it was future, it was still salvation by faith that it’s Him saving us.      As Dr. P stated, all things God laid out for us comes from His love.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

He says, “The 22 graphs which are used as letters in the Hebrew alphabet are 22 proper names originally used to designate different states or structures of one cosmic energy, which is essence and semblance, of all that is. Even though they correspond to numbers, symbols, and ideas, those 22 vastly exceed all the most exhaustive sets of classes: they cannot be distributed among things because they ARE that which they designate”.

Of course religious values, which are perceived as stemming from a deity's edict upon humanity, but the deepest held values held between two people in a committed relationship (whether or not they are religious) is still sacred to them. And in that same line of reasoning, I think that human beings have a drive to honor the sacred they find in the world, whether that is within their relationship, their beliefs about god, a bucolic vista which they feel is imbued with a spiritual essence.

I’ve never found Peterson likable, and understand that would not necessarily be important to him, but the last few minutes of this totally turned that around…  His ability to correlate the dark side of openness as a feature of personality with disillusionment brought on by psychedelics, by those who are already open, and questioning identity in religious traditions was concrete. His emotion toward the end is hard to define, but he impressed me as someone willing to be torn in half by opposing ideas, over and over again to arrive at various truths. Seeing that vulnerability in someone who has come off to me repeatedly as abrasive showed me the personal cost of shuttling between each polarity.

@Superman-101,"The Purpose Of Life  As with any philosophy: the moment a person sees a flaw in one aspect - the whole thing will, and should, collapse.  For example, The Principle of Polarity says: anything that is polarised, such as black and white, are basically the same thing - colour.  However, that does not mean black is white or white is black when we say they are both aspects of colour.  Black is black and it always will be black. White is white and it always will be white.  Of course ... it is possible to see both as grey but this (colour) is still black and white pixles / areas creating the illusion of grey.  This goes for everything we perceive - including dreams - since light is light and darkness is darkness regardless of subjective identification.  Thus, all philosophy is rendered worthless - because it makes perception malleable within the expression of delusion.  Perception, without delusion, allows all of reality to function eternally.  Therefore, the purpose of life (in this world) is to engender an eternal estate in preparation for the next world.  This is to say, we are required to leave any delusional estate (sin) to embrace the perfected mindset (Christ).  ...because the next world is eternal.  This reality will ultimately pass away - along with those who embraced some delusional estate.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

@Superman-101,"Alpha and Omega  Adam and Eve were told they can partake of any tree except the one that has knowledge of good and evil - so we know two things:   1) They had consciousness prior to partaking the forbidden fruit - because they understood what they were told to avoid.  2) They were allowed to obtain knowledge - because the other trees did not bare fruit that contained the mixture of lies and truth.  They were (basically) warned to avoid anything that causes delusion - so we know the creator genuinely cares for His creation.  After Adam and Eve partook of the forbidden fruit: they realised they were naked - which means they became aware they have a defiant attitude toward the creator (with a sense of vulnerability that took effect) and, thus, felt shame.  This caused consciousness, present in man, to become corrupt which then allowed him to exploit the opportunity to assert dominion over others he considers inferior.  This is why God told Eve, ""Your desire shall be to your husband and he shall 'rule' over you.""  She was, after all, the weaker vessel - so she would become subject to the misogynistic attitude of those lacking in understanding.  Therefore, it is attitude that has been evolving or devolving through the ages: and consciousness, being a composite of attitude, has forged institutions that have galvanized class within hierarchical structure.  This situation was exasperated by a class of angels called ""the Watchers"" who left their eternal estate to found early civilization and establish religions that exalt their own interests.  These interests include the liberation of lust - where they exist as a demonic possession in those who embrace the assertion of authority over others.  Their religions (including false Christianity) depend upon a faith in the mystery, rather than Yahshua, to draw the unsuspecting into the delusion of thinking hierarchy is a vital component of civilization.  For this reason: secular society cannot function without religion: and, as you should have guessed by now, religion is not sanctioned by the creator - so we know civilization, past and present, bares no resemblance to the (prophesied) Kingdom of Heaven.  Yahshua told us not to get angry with another nor lust upon another - because these (attitudes), being sin in the heart, are the manifestation of one's assertion of authority over others.  ...and sin (delusion) is when a person seeks to justify wicked behaviour as righteous.  Yahshua showed us the eternal estate is available to those who practice humility - which is to say: the body of flesh, we have, allows us to develop a faith that facilitates a return to perfection.  The correct attitude will facilitate greater hermeneutic understanding: and this can adjust conscious awareness - but salvation comes to those who acknowledge the authority of Yahshua (in faith).  He told us to love one another as He loved us - so the Father in Heaven can see He loves the Father.

@jameshopkins21,"Creation narratives of many kinds can give insights into the meaning and purpose of life in many ways.  One part of a creation story that I am familiar with has come to have profound significance to me on many fronts: scientific and religious. Allow me to share it with you. See what emerges from your mind as you meditate on this conversation:   ELOHIM: Jehovah, Michael, now that the earth is formed, divided, and beautified, and vegetation is growing thereon, return and place beasts upon the land: the elephant, the lion, the tiger, the bear, the horse, and all other kinds of animals--fowls in the air in all their varieties, fishes of all kinds in the waters, and insects and all manner of animal life upon the earth.  Command the beasts, the fowls, the fishes, the insects, all creeping things, and other forms of animal life to multiply in their respective elements, each after its kind, and every kind of vegetation to multiply in its sphere, that every form of life may fill the measure of its creation and have joy therein.

@jameshopkins21,"Dr. Peterson, I am a fan. I have come to listen to your podcasts and motivational clips for an hour or two or three nearly every day. I wish I could share with you mountains of information that I have gleaned over many years of experience on virtually every topic you discuss. The call to challenge young men to make the world a better place by encouraging competence and speaking truth, on recognizing the uniqueness of every soul and serving the least among us ring deeply within me. I lack the distinction and achievements that those you interview possess, yet I am not without insights and experience that I think you would find valuable. I am a 73-year-old retired general surgeon who is self-employed part time as a medical researcher. I am also a lay minister or a priesthood holder in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I served a two year mission for my church in Chile from 1969 to 1971 and on a church high council in New York City. I closed my surgical practice in the intermountain west in 1996 after suffering a mid-brain bleed that was complicated by acute hydrocephalus requiring emergency placement of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt that left me with chronic drowsiness, impaired executive function, and some other problems but without obvious impact on my movement or speech. I worked for 13 years after my stroke at many odd jobs including working in a junior high and two career colleges teaching health, mathematics, anatomy and physiology, health administration, chemistry, biology, microbiology, etc. until difficulties planning my lecture schedule and submitting final grades on time led to my dismissal and finally a declaration of totally disability. I wrote my senior thesis at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine on evidence based medicine and medical outcome research as it relates to hypertension care in eleven New York City voluntary hospitals. My advisor was the developer of the health status index and its use as a measure of good or bad health policies. I did my internship at a hospital near Greenwich Village in Manhattan and did a fellowship in cardiothoracic surgery in Columbia, Missouri. My wife, a Juilliard-trained pianist, and our four children are exceptionally bright but were found to have an inductive learning problem that severely threatened their academic, professional, and social futures. I was told that I needed to summarize all that my children read and help them find the main ideas of what they regarded as confusing collections of random facts and to do research projects with them in history and science. I spent 6 to 12 hours a day tutoring them for 17 years. All their projects and research papers won state and/or national prizes. They were on a wide variety of topics including the historical context of Edgar Allen Poe's A Cask of Amontillado, Thomas Jeffersons views on slavery, the role of ancestors in the Revolutionary War and the Pequot War, just war theory as well as bridge and roof truss design, human insulation systems, and the mathematical modelling of break dancing. Each of my children qualified for scholarships--in large part due to my poverty--at premier colleges: Amherst College, Yale, MIT, and Harvard. All are married with children and gainfully employed. My oldest son teaches art and animation at two colleges in Chicago. My daughter graduated from Yale in Theater Arts and Acting from the Manhattan School Music in classical voice. She has won a Tony Award and received a Grammy Nomination. My two younger sons obtained Ph.D.s in mechanical engineering from MIT. One is a tenured professor in mechanical engineering and the other is a reseach engineer for Ford Motor Company. Talk about joy!! Things could have been so much worse for them. I am divorced but still interact significantly with my precious wife of 35 years. I was exposed to diethylstilbestrol in utero, and in 2002 developed a need to cross-dress that proved extremely difficult to control. St. John's Wort and Vyvanse eliminated completely my need to cross-dress for a year and a half but led to a clinically rather minor but ominous right frontal lacunar stroke in 2009 that required that I permanently discontinue these meds.  I cross-dress only in private but have been involved with trans issues that go against the current trends now for many years. Still my wife was nauseated by even the idea of my cross-dressing and decided to divorce me. I have no property and no car and have received a considerable amount of help from the welfare system of my faith over the years. Nevertheless, I regard myself as rich beyond my wildest dreams. I would love to spend some time on many topics with you including how to deal with economic inequality, challenging all men and women young and old to actively participate in promoting and implementing Christian values and learning to living a life of obedience to the laws and ordinances that Christ taught his church to follow, faith, repentance and sacrifice, consecration, virtue, and purity that prepares all in the human family past, present, and future, including the least among us, for a joyous eternal life together through taking responsibility to serve our families, our churches, and our communities and through taking upon us the name of Jesus Christ and always remembering the atonement and sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

Psychedelics, as well as any mind altering drug has its ""unintended"" and ""unearned"" consequences by opening doors that should not be opened. And, most people only discover that once opened and by then it's too late. There is a way back (one has to come to ones senses, realizing a wrong has been done to the ""Vessel"" ) and with repentance, prayer and faith, it can be reversed and closed. - from personal experience. - Written for those who need to close those doors and how to go about it.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

@talirubininthewords,"First, thank you for explaining openness at 52 years old. It is truly a gift to have it explained this way. As for psychedelics, my very humble opinion is that it is more of the same bottomless humane search inside the self  and another delosenole conclusion that it is transformative, same as meditation medications, contemplations and so on... all that is healing and magical and spiritual can only be archived by engaging with reality or at least observe reality. A good evidence for the fact that psychedelics are not the promised land are the many cases of people experiencing a psychotic outburst just meditation.  so the work remains relationships connecting empathy and community.",3년 전,0,

@andrewlee7797,"“It is really something that you can’t control your conscience. So what is it really?  It is not you. You are accountable to it.”    As a student of early Buddhist literature this really struck me as having some parallel to the characteristic of “not-self” as expressed in the Samyutya Nikaya  (SN 22.59, Anatta-lakkhana Sutta) as well as the opening verses in the Dhammapada “Mind precedes all states … speak or act with an impute mind and suffering follows.”  I mention this because I think it is another tradition that speaks to the same problem — of how near to organize your life, a tradition that admits that suffering as a basic truth. So, if we see that there is suffering in the world and we see that our thoughts and feelings and perceptions are not really our own, how should we act?  And the Buddha tells us that we suffer for our misdeeds and flourish for our wholesome actions. Furthermore, the texts reveal that nothing is really under our perfect control so we avoid speaking or acting when our mind is clouded.   I know Dr Peterson avoids referring to Buddhism, being a non-expert. But this is wonderfully rich stuff that these religious traditions have deep parallels and that there is literature preserved from early Buddhism that speaks to the mechanisms of conscience, the importance of ethical behavior, and  the middle way between holding yourself too tightly and avoiding accountability.",3년 전,0,

Furthermore, all religious examples he used in regards to finding truth were from the bible.  We know there to be about 3000 religions on record, so...  1.  Would it be correct to say that Jordan considers Christianity to be a superior source of truth when compared against other religions?  And if so, why, from your study of Jordan's works, do you think he reaches this conclusion?  or   2.  Perhaps he knows that the majority of his listeners were raised in a Christian society, and therefore, to understand the truth of how they think the way they think, it is of particular importance that Christianity be studied.  Outside of that, perhaps he doesn't consider Christianity to otherwise have more of a monopoly on truth than other religions.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

Children coming from seaman, water's break, they come down the birth canal,then they birth. A birth certificate is issued, after registration. Definition, to give up your assets. This is admiral law, law of the sea. Therefore a birth certificate is a wear house certificate. That's why if they have to go to court, they stand in the docks and will be governed under admiral law. So is it a good idea to inform upon your child. And deny them the law of the land. That's why so many people end up in where house's, I. e, jail, unlawfully.

@dragonfly3714,"We have a possibility now NOT to make a new religion called PETERSONIANS 📌 Thank you Sir Jordan Peterson once more. I really really have decided to love you for all your information . Seeing this film a kind of had to think about God,  Jesus Christ  and his 12-twelve disciples . Number 12 is something..... I now this is an incredible statement ,- I just have to think his new book with 12 issues is the new diciples.    AND I would not be surprised if it was proven Jordan is an incarnation of Jesus but some faults though..              .AND another different is that Jesus did not write a book. That was written by his disciples and not by HIMSELF....AND we got a new chance not to make a religion which we shall know was not Jesus wish.                                       AND we shall now lots of it was stolen by the Vatican ..... Jesus was not christian . He just new God was real and that Jesus himself was grown up in the culture which JORDAN know is the natural fertilizer from which the culture has come from. So here we go again                                   AND Whats really really truth and incredibl besides it is a kind of miracle for me I dont have a clue where these thoughts and meanings are coming from. I feel it is a presence in my mind/ head this is for Jordan.     AND I guess this is the issue we are all into for knowing whats its all about.

Why do you have to go through government And sign paperwork and get a priest to Marry you. Doesn't mean anything. The commitment and marriage is a vow to God and who your with, not government. Doesn't mean people who don't believe in government marriage won't get married. People sacrifice for who they love.

Their assumption that God doesn't exist and their perspective of where thoughts come from, shape their view of me so I shouldn't become resentful. But it is frustrating.

All started by misunderstanding trusting certain people in stressful times that were perhaps covertly sent over at inconvenient times to my home. Causing some frustrations. I’ve been living in my car in parking lots starving while these people in authorities know my mothers family and my own who’ve I’ve not had relationships with for years because of my own desire to create my own life. I kept working on my own family had a few friends who’ve also moved away. There tactics have the tendency to make you appear like you flipped out . But by now their are people that know for a fact that I’m not mentally ill. Their tactics actually cause you to appear like you are. For example not too many people know that they have a legal right to entering your space and going through your apartment. Play little cruel games cut clothing to see how you would react much like the old technique to see how mad you might get. I’d like to say on here what’s done through resturants to get you to go to the hospital very cruel !!! When I think of this happening to my kids I’m horrified by this unjust Ritchie !!!! My kids have suffered so much emotionally ! I miss my daughter so much ! But I’m worried about my son as well ! One is on one end of the country and one is on the other end. These medical white coat specialist drive their cars close to your and just sit in their car and say nothing ! They get paid big bucks stolen from your family while i sit in my car  starving . Not even offering you  antything to say thank you for the patronage ! Surely to god there must be a way to find a way to help personally instead of allowing these very unjust things from happening .  I’m not a drug user nor an alcoholic . At all. I talk about the Bible  yes but … I have other interests I can’t have because of not having a place. There’s no left and no right !!! We are run by the bar !!!! There is no help of family won’t open their door !!!! GET IT !!!! Someone needs to let them know … I’m sure they might get it thinking about how these given things to give you the runs not having a bathroom handy sometimes very dangerous and very permanent !  There’s no RIGHT THERES NO LEFT !!! We are run by the BAR . When you ask for government help !!!! For your family . YOU DONT KNOW THIS , YOU ARREST THEM FROM BEING IN CONTROL OF THEMSELVES .

No wonder this one went extremely deep and I've only gotten into it. I have yet to see him step out, to say too much, or leave an important point unexplained. From a Christian standpoint, I am wary of the desire to fully adopt or strive for another person's ideal. But Peterson is able to encourage young people, and especially young men, in a way that the church often fails to do. I, for one, had never gotten the bold and clear message to really get out there a figure out my place in society. What I got was more of a - trust the process, wait for things to become evident. I can't emphasize enough how many things I have learned or been able to put together through listening to his lectures and interviews. Extremely intelligent, respectable person",4년 전,0,

In the handful of relationships, climb in my Land Surveying career, circles of friends, my unawareness to the importance of religion, how to interact in the world, shadow work, the dark corners of alcohol and drug abuse, and importance of making the right sacrifices.

I was illuminated by the kundalini (serpent) spirit then 6 years ago I got properly enlightened by the Holy Spirit which showed me what a fool I was before. Spirit led me to the real Yahshua/Jesus Christ and everything changed - paradigm shifted. This is being born again and it's an ongoing surprise to me   We're in the end-times for real, it's serious sh*t. It escapes the notice of our self-absorbed, glamour soaked world that we're in a spiritual war for souls, the immensity of ignorance is astonishing: the dark powers bedazzling the minds of the masses (Ephesians 6:12). We've inherited an ancient spiritual subversion: the earth is fallen, the holistic fields of nature are fallen state. Nothing is as was meant to be. Mankind is a spiritually fallen race highly prone to deceit and delusion. Frankly, we need a Saviour and by Jesus Christ do we have a Glorious One   As a new ager I couldn't believe but in the Light of Spirit Jesus really is the Way, the truth and the Life just like He said: no one comes to God except through Jesus, there's no other way (Matthew 7:13-14). As a neo-vedantist I wasn't convinced but turns out the Bible is Spirit breathed, written by men inspired by the Holy Spirit. Jesus is vividly portrayed and endorsed in the new testament, in fact he's apparent in the old testament too (Luke 24:27 & 44) and by the Light of Spirit we're allowed to see that and know Him. Any previously perceived discrepancies or contradictions are ironed out and the supernatural narrative flows most beautifully. The Bible is the Revelation of Jesus Christ.",4년 전,0,

@maddi62,"JP is fine if you don’t mind sitting through hours and hours of wondering and preponderances, thinkings out loud that just go round and round in circles and never really land on anything solid. While he’s wandering around all this mysterious, ephemeral stuff there always feels like there’s something good coming, but it rarely seems to get there. He might eventually alight on something that sounds familiar but they are often fleeting moments that need more flesh on the bones to be anything like convincing. He rarely provides this and is off into the mystical fog again leaving you with nothing to really grasp onto.   It’s telling the truth that keeps the world from falling apart? Really? In my experience it’s mostly fudging, stretching, massaging and evading the truth that keeps the world turning, but for the occasional moments when it is actually essential. I want my children to learn to always tell the truth? No, I want them to learn when it is appropriate to tell the truth.

@walkersmith2512,Thank you for participating in this podcast.  I especially appreciate your discussion of the world of value structure toward the end of the video as you explain even more about  order and chaos.  This connection to the examples of “constrained malevolence” especially in the last century is very interesting. I agree with your thoughts on the conscience being the voice of God/ Holy Spirit within.  It is as real as any other function of our physical being…..just harder to explain. Thank you for sharing what you have learned through these utube videos.  I have your first 2 books and look forward to the newest one. I have also gifted them to my college age grandsons.,4년 전,7,

I am indeed grateful of his will to speak and his humility to not state his ideas as facts but rather an excercise of thinking and reflection. I am myself a Christian and I can only say the only other who also gets human beings and even more than my guy Jordan, is the Lord. But to actually read and understand the Bible is a hard task.

In addition I would say that it is obvious that, while he weaves very complex reasoning, he is very careful to clarify his thoughts as he moves through them. This is why he is so good at improving your opportunities to be a better thinker and communicator.

I find it hard to accept that people disagree with taking responsibility for oneself, for standing up to fears, to understand that the state of humanity has been suffering and it is our perseverance through that that makes us  special. Is it Hierarchies? I mean he sites everything and has read more than most people combined. Is it his study of psychology? Or his assessment of the human mind? I am “strawmaning” because I really do not know, whenever I ask I am told that he has “alterier motives” and is “trying to say he’s racist and a bigot, but carefully to not let people know” or they attack his lobster assessment and take it horrendously out of context.

@QuestioningYam,"I don’t think so, he usually says he doesn’t have an opinion on something when he is acknowledging that is not well enough versed or read on the matter to be giving and opinion on it.   For example, if you asked me about WW2 I would happily tell you with confidence what happened and how because I’m obsessed with the topic, but if you asked me about Vietnam, I would have to say the same thing as Peterson here. I know above what most are taught in school about Vietnam but not enough to completely argue what has or has not happened or why, and who is morally justified or not.   Moral of the story, don’t preach things when not read on them and do not assume until further investigation. If you asked me about Alex Jones and his claims, I’d tell you that I don’t have much of an opinion on that, while they are wild claims that does not mean they are untrue.

I love your excellent videos, and a little more about me, before I check out:          I am American, born in Chicago in 1942, educated and learned to work, travel, and to help non beggars. I am in my 79th year, but had Chicago been as deadly, as it is here, I would not be here. I gave God the glory for the protection and safety of my life.   I started learning Spanish at age 14 at DuSable high, with Mrs. Lemon, who was an excellent teacher.  I was 20 , when I started to travel in 1962, and I never allowed evil demons to  stop me from enjoying life.   I never worked in any country, but USA.  I always watch in depth all countries, especially the countries, that your friends visited. I married my own brown American at 27, and had our only daughter at 37.   I gave her the love of travel, and she teaches English around the world, currently in Bali. I am a widow, who speaks several languages, I speak Spanish fluently. Acapulco and Singapore are my favorite places to live as a second home.  I have donated my body, and my family knows to open the door, and allow who they invite to carry out my stuff, after they close the bank account.  My travel has been limited to virtual, but I  have enjoyed traveling from age 20-73.  I missed grits in Acapulco, and my daughter mail me  a box, and some mustard greens seeds. I am Muslim, so I do not eat pork.   Most people in my travels felt I was African, but my DNA is African, First Nation, and Scotland, but I am USA to the bone.  I know God will stop the genocide in Chicago, that has been going on for over 60 years, and I had to leave. I have kept written, , audio and video journals since age 15.  Computers and education is how I earned my income from 7-70. I was raised never beg or steal from anyone, and I was not better than anyone, nor were they better than me. RESPECT is the name of the game.  Death can come at anytime, but I enjoy every day, until the final day. I am happy that I help non beggars help themselves.  Thank you for your EXCELLENT videos.

People who can hammer one nail over and over everyday to the exclusion of all else are either slaves or of lower intelligence. Jordan misses so many relevant points on this issue. Firstly, creativity, in terms of doing many different things for ourselves and others, is how humans traditionally survived before there were specialty jobs for people like himself in niche practices like psychology. To assert that creative people are like hippie dippy types who are so open that they are unable to close deals is baseless and absurd. Look at all the daily tasks of a traditional farmer, including fixing his tractor and playing some harmonica at night for entertainment. That’s all creativity and hard work. He clearly resents people who possess traits that he doesn’t have or doesn’t understand. Oh, and the military has confirmed UFOs. Not sure how Jordan is an expert on that too.",4년 전,0,

The only thing he could tell back was that I spelled wrong two words being a bit tilted about his arrogance and ignorance.  P.S: J Peterson mention at some point Mircea Eliade ( a lot of people do when it comes to shamanism and history of religions ).

@MAN-pp4qg,"At 1:15:57, Dr. Peterson says ""You know in the deepest part of your heart that if you don't tell the truth, the world falls apart. And that's actually true. You know I talked about unearned wisdom. It's no trivial matter to understand that. You know Dostoevsky said 'Everyone is responsible for everything that happens to them and everything that happens to everyone else as well.' And you know that's an insane statement and he was a very extreme person but it's also true.""  Earlier in the interview, Dr. Peterson talks about how the story of Cain and Abel really struck a blow to him that he hasn't quite ever got over. I had that Biblical story queued up in my mind when I heard him say what I quoted and he was tearing up as he said it. I paused the video to pull out my Bible and I re-read where God asks Cain where is brother is and knowing full well he had just murdered him, Cain says ""I know not (where he is). Am I my brother's keeper?"" (Genesis 4v9) God does not answer his question because it wasn't asked with the intent to be answered. It was said out of sarcasm and I believe also because, as Jesus later revealed, ""out of the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks"" (Luke 6v45). I wonder and can only imagine what Cain was feeling when he uttered those words, what he discovered about his heart in that moment. For us today, what if us not taking responsibility for our own lives leads to the destruction or even deaths of those we claim to love. Am I my brother's keeper? Yes. Yes you are, and so am I, and if we abdicate that responsibility, it's not just us that will suffer for it, and so, we press on (Philippians 3v13-14).  Thank you for this interview with Dr. Peterson. As always, I found his insights very enlightening and most encouraging to keep pushing back the darkness, even if just one inch at a time.",4년 전,1,

I like stories a lot , personally, I always did , even when I was very very young (first thing I remember from my life is a story); I even wrote a couple of them , for myself... Stories are the history of human beings, from the beginning, a red string flowing back all the way to the dawn of mankind. Stories are telling us the sum of truths that all the generations before us “saw” and wanted to let us know . Beyond everything, from mouth to mouth , thousands of generations before me which lived and worked hard , my ancestors that gave me life... all of them had something to say to me , and those are the stories.  One more thing, we should change how we see “order” and “chaos” the way I see it. Why think we should “do” something about them? They are not the problem ... the problem is us. They are both necessary for us to live...We just have to keep the balance.

Yes it’s stressful and sometimes you need to shelf the issue, or that you need personal growth, but I believe this overlooks a glaring alternate need to figure out how to rectify the situation instead of ignoring it. Often the resentment, in my opinion, comes from an inability or inexperience in dealing with the cause. For example, you may have social anxiety and lose your focus on what you wanted to say to someone who cornered you and caused the resentment; in retrospect, with experience and knowledge in expressing your feelings you can have a positive outcome instead. This contrasts to the theory here that the resentment is irreconcilable through ones own lack of abilities in handling the conflict, not averting and having a “false peace “.",4년 전,0,

Petersen is a very interesting person because he gets the science but is willing to reveal he is mostly driven by his subjective views. I think is it responcible to question someone like Petersen who sounds so wise and rigorous in a non-explicit conversation like this interview. I would have appreciated some hard questions about Petersen's more polarizing views. Petersen builds many of his ideas/arguments with pseudo-facts that try to bewilder people he speaks with and as a clinical psychologist he uses confirmation bias to appeal to/ramp-up those that agree with him - as he said personally he doesn't like confrontation.  Unfortunately it is dangerous to question Petersen this way as some of his followers go after people nasty ways. The lack of dislikes below are self explainitory.

SOCRATES: Then if not, nobody desires what is bad, for what else is unhappiness but desiring bad things and getting them?  MENO: It looks as if you are right, Socrates, and nobody desires what is bad.  SOCRATES: Now you have just said that virtue consists in a wish for good things plus the power to acquire them.  In this definition the wish is common to everyone, and in that respect no one is better than his neighbor.   Cain and Able-- and God said, to paraphrase: ""man vs. man, watch out, it's always going to be a thing"".  Tim Ferriss is an volcano luging, XXX expert question asker.

@maxpbeaumont," @bencooper8286  I hear ya, Ben. But why should Tim question his ""polarizing"" views? I thought this was a free-flowing, deep and honest conversation. Nothing felt forced. Why not appreciate the conversation for what it is? Yes, Peterson is flawed and biased... (as we all are). He certainly has a righteous tone at times too. But ultimately, I find him authentic. And to me, that's refreshing. He's not afraid to take the conversation to ""controversial/polarizing"" places... because (I truly believe) he's not coming from a malicious place. I believe he's coming from a place of curiosity. Does he get it wrong sometimes? Yes. I actually think he has a slight bias against more left-leaning institutions/people. But, I ultimately think his value far outweighs his controversy. And I think this conversation was proof of that. A genuinely curious person who wants to help people. That's the impression I get anyway! Hopefully you can still enjoy some of what he says :)",4년 전,0,

@westerfrye2089,"The only thing I see he gets wrong here is the story of Cain and Abel. Even preachers sometimes get it wrong though so I'm not knocking him for that.  In the story of Cain an Abel God didn't reject Cains sacrifice because that just happens sometimes. Cain brought a sacrifice of his on making, fruit of the ground that he had to work with his own hands.  Abel brought his best lamb that he had raised by hand nourished and loved. The story is a  representation of God's love for us. God doesn't want our good works he wants our best or everything.  The lamb represented Christ God's perfect and only begotten son and the blood he would have to shed so the sins of man could be covered with the blood of the perfect sacrifice.  Not only a sacrifice but one that was given freely by Christ and excepted by God.  Cain shows us that our good works mean nothing because God doesn't see our works he sees our heart.

Bit I'd really like to put this out there and see if there's any other living soul sharing this particular sentiment of mine with regards to Peterson's current, I shall say, ""condition"", for lack of a better word.  And I don't mean that in the slightest way offensively or condescendingly.   I'm in awe of this man's output of practical and actually applicable wisdom into the world in general and into the lives of many of his followers, including myself, rather more particularly.   However, the sentiment I have set out to share in here is that of sheer pain and horrid misery I feel pouring out of Peterson's voice tone and pitches, particularly during his interviews that I've watched, which came out starting from the early parts of the 2020 and onwards.   I mean, I've heard, seen and read of the psychosomatic struggles this monumental man had to go through.  And, although I do not yet possess any specifics as to the true nature and extent of his struggles, I somehow get these vibes of true hardships, utter pain, unimaginable misery, painful disdain and shattering desparation by watching him and even more so by listening to him.  Especially when I detect those relatively long pauses of his when he's trying to (in my understanding) recollect and recompose himself.  Coming right back in from those silent intervals, he has the most heart breaking of voice pitches, its like I, unwillingly, get a glimpse right into the edge or the pinnacle of his eminent, on setting internal collapse.   I usually end up putting a real internal fight with myself at that point not to break down in tears myself from this tsunami of pain I feel coming out of this man's voice.   I was simply wondering if that's some sort of an imaginary over blown thing that is probably more self inflicted in my state of being or whether anybody else out there gets this vibe of heart melting suffering pouring from Peterson.   BTW, I wanted to put particular emphasis on the fact that I do not feel sorry in any sense for the man.  And certainly do not pitty him.  And don't think that any sane person would ever dare to have these feelings towards him.   It's just that I kinda hurt listening to him.   It's like in some ultra unacceptable way I feel his own bone shuttering pain crawling through my own body and soul.   So?  Is my perception purely a subjective personal thing, or is there any hint of objective reality to it?",4년 전,0,

The Truth SEEms to be  either THAT ALL matters  and all our choices do have consequences, like  Peterson believes,  or nothing matters AT ALL ..., and there is the fork in the road of our lives to take  as free  individuals , as well as still a sovereign nation.   I am glad though that  SOMEBODY LISTENED, like the writer Arenas wanted US and the whole world  to do , regarding the evils of authoritarianism , disguised as the social collectivist solution to what ails the world,  in the so cruel and impoverishing  marxist ideology  (so loudly  and so recklessly is  being promoted by the  lying Useful Idiots  in the American and European political  left)  that Arenas  had experienced and suffered through first hand in his native country  of Cuba to9 this day under  socialist dictatorship  (and I don't mean  ARENAS , as in uncle Bernie SANDERS, of course; but as in the exiled  writer  Reinaldo Arenas).

@frankstared,"Anger (or externalized depression) is revealed in one's very thoughts and patterns which of course speaks to one's unresolved trauma and pain.  Additionally, the reactive and unaware emphasis on others' intentions as opposed to your own sense of authentic self, equilibrium, equanimity, goodwill and belief in the common good is already an indication that one is unmoored from their true self.  When others malign us, our response to their actions has nothing to do with their actions.  It may seem that way (that our emotional reaction is a result of their perceived provocation) but the truth is that if we become rattled by their actions then we fail to not only respect the authentic child within but have given them our own agency.  Indeed, this is why anger is so often a hallmark of a very precarious sense of self.   Alternately, consider those who work (not fight, a critical distinction) for human rights.  Would they be able to make their incremental gains if they allowed tremendous systemic obstacles or individual criticisms to distract and provoke them?  You see, our wellness becomes plainly obvious by our very emphasis of reality: is it about others' thoughts, opinions or treatment of us (Peterson's notion of 'suffering') or rather about how we contribute to the common good, regardless of the hostility, admiration or apathy of others?  Building community requires integration of the self which paradoxically relies on selflessly serving others and the natural environment., therein lies wellness and indeed the pathway to authenticity.",4년 전,0,

@mlhproductions,"... I respect and admire Dr. Peterson a great deal, however, as time goes on, there does seem to be an unusual blind spot regarding 'women'. I don't mean the abstraction of the feminine principal inherent in the yin/yang of which he's quite capable of speaking, I mean Peterson's well-meaning and on-going articulation about the male spiritual journey through life ...   He obviously KNOWS that story very well. It's clear to most observers that he, himself, is on such a hero's journey.   No problem with that.   However, his foundational Biblical framework, (as the substantial religious structure of Western civilization), increasingly fails to apply - or appeal - to women.   Think about that.  That's half of the human species.  And, surely, that's a problem.   It's not just the inherent  'patriarchy' of the Biblical doctrine itself, it's about the greater misunderstanding, (even implied dismissal), of the innately deep difference - and potential - of women.   As a woman, I can hear and understand HIM, but, I wonder increasingly, is he really capable of hearing - and genuinely understanding - the spiritual journey of the heroine?

@nickmagrick7702,"27:16 I disagree with peterson on this one. Marriages have become pointless celebrations more props to support an otherwise useless industry that has no reason to exist other than the false sense of worth we give to it, so we're willing to waste huge sums or resources because we don't consider unions to be important unless we do. Thats never how it used to be, and is appalling. A marriage certificate is a piece of paper, thats it. If you require some big celebration to prove to yourself or others the worthiness of the relationship then it isn't one that your ready to take to that level of permanence.    I think our over dependence on these exuberant rituals is one of the primary reasons why divorce rates are skyrocketing. We get married way before we're ready for it, because we have this false image in our heads about what marriage is supposed to be. Like many other things in society we fit ourselves into this mold, and then when we realize we can't fit that mold everything falls apart and we then dig deeper into convincing ourselves that we want something when we really don't.    There is a difference between not marrying and completely isolating yourselves from the outside community, which we do a damn good job of now anyways so his point is really a moot one in context.",4년 전,0,

@Godskingdomwithin,"Jordan seems to not be aware of the benefits derived from the use of  psychedelics, and how they can benefit individuals who suffer from PTSD, because individuals with PTSD are so protective of their psyche because of previous traumas, that they don’t know how to be “open,” and vulnerable, which is necessary to heal. MDMA is showing to be very helpful in those cases, and by enabling someone with PTSD to be vulnerable with a psychologist, that is trained in treating this disorder, which is showing to be very beneficial.  Psilocybin is being used to help people with diseases like cancer, accept their mortality, and helps them process their fears, and difficulties with dying. Ibogaine is being used to help Heroin addicts-opiate addicts, to quit. LSD has enabled alcoholics to walk away and never drink again, and there were studies as far back as the 1960’s that were demonstrating such benefits. In fact, before LSD was made illegal in the mid-60s, many psychiatrists were using it to help with their patients neurosis. Alcoholism was one area that showed great promise. In fact, Bill W, The cofounder of Alcoholics Anonymous participated in a study of LSD, and he felt it held great promise in the treatment of alcoholism! The American Psychiatric Association, discontinued the use of LSD in psychoanalysis, because the patients that benefited from its use, benefited from what they called,” Peak moments,” not psychoanalysis.  So, psychedelics show great promise in treating quite a few different serious psychological issues. MAP Is the auspice doing studies with the use of different psychedelics with different forms of mental illness. .",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@ashleyl6790," @booksquid856  The basics were unified pretty early on in the Nicene and Apostle's Creeds. I like Jordan Peterson, but I just don't think he would affirm Jesus as Savior and Lord. Yes, we could go on endlessly parsing out what it means to even say that... but I have to believe the Holy Spirit allows even people of severely diminished mental capacity who can't endlessly philosophize about these concepts to have an understanding which transcends words. I think charity in all non-essential things is, well, essential. I think what bothers me about JP sometimes is that you can't stand outside looking ""through"" things forever, to borrow a concept from Lewis. A window is for seeing through to something, as Lewis said. Endless analysis and total skepticism (even charitable skepticism like JP's) are dead ends (or rather an infinite dead end).",4년 전,0,

I don't want to sound like a FanBoi bit I feel he is transcendental for our time, a great thinker and he manages to convey it, even when he goes deep, I just have to replay it a couple of times to stay with him. Thank you both. Many detractors want to attack and bring him down, you better bring your A Game. Some complain he is not perfect or 💯% right 100% of the time..... News flash no one is, or has ever been, be it a deity, and ideal or a person.  That does not make him wrong, strange how so many detractors, especially from the self named Progressives who bang on about how people are all fluid and non binary can only criticise in a binary way.  I especially liked his theory about paradigm thoughts that have not gone away through the ages have had all the inconsistency stripped away over time and we are left with the distilled truth, or real nature! Boom.  I have often thought about this but JBP articulates it in its essence so well. I had a great teacher once at school (circa 15-16 yrs old) and she explored old nursery rhymes and sayings with us, it is so incredible how true and relevant they are today, even when the author, culture or origin are unknown.

I am continuously awed by his abilities and desire to help humankind.  Even debilitated, he is a force of nature.  One of God’s truly special creations as much because of his humility and humanity as his intellect and communication skills.

People are miserable in a lot of relationships because the man looks for a mate before he embarks on his mission.  He gets a lot of necessary character development when he trains and applies his gifts to his calling (patience, perseverance, mental/emotional security, self-confidence, etc.).

@beaulin5628,"We appreciate you, Jordan. If you really want to know the truth about God and whether he exists, and whether the Bible is true, this is the only way:  "" for he that cometh to God must BELIEVE that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him."" (Hebrews 11:6) and:  ""Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little CHILD shall in no wise enter therein.""  (Luke 18:17)  Men must humble themselves and become TEACHABLE before God. They are mere children compared to the God who made them and the entire universe. True ""wisdom"" would seek to contact and learn from the God who made them. Unbelief insults God by implying that God is a liar. Men use the the tiny mind that God gave them to judge The MIND that made them. Not very smart. God requires that men believe FIRST in order to find Him. Jesus:  ""If any man will DO his will, he shall KNOW of the doctrine, whether it be of God or whether I speak of myself."" God promises Eternal Life and resurrection from the dead as a free gift to those will cease from unbelief and rebellion to Him. Worth looking into, dying mortals.",4년 전,0,
@eliveli97,"Dear Jordan Peterson, U've been a father figure in my last 3 years (i just turned 24) U've gone as far & as deep as the scientific method allows U into the fundamental matters of life. I feel that position of mental exhaustion to the point where i'm stuck on the ideas and rotating around the data without clear answer or a solid ground to step on. Here comes the ancient wisdom and spiritual teachings (i won't use the term religion bcoz it was turned into something ugly and its entangled with layer of lies & misunderstanding) Do You notice to what or who are U referring when using the word ""You"" or ""I"" most commonly we use it by meaning the mind, the persona or the ego, and that quite a bummer bcoz , u know, we R at first a Spirit with a body, the body includes ur mind organs etc, but we also have emotional body and a spiritual ""body"", haha, or better call it consciousness which is oceanic and infinite, its beyond black&white, it's the ever loving spirit of ours which is an extention of God Himself. It is time to transcend our tangible perception of the world, and it is quite scary, to admitt our god nature (we r spirits), it comes with huge responsibility but in se time it's a relief to know know u got Gos on yr side, Who btw always is on your side, but have the freedom of choice to deny it. Let just look it that way: there is order (good and evel, black and white, male& female etc) all contrasts serve the purpose to ballance out our existence, and there is the ever loving consciousness/spirit, IT doesn't judge IT simply  understand both parts, IT is US, We are creators, we are beyond "" order"" by essence, this is our heart, our core at the deepest. The goal is to dig down and connected to it, that is quite a journey but also very simple- just invite It and allow it. You are the light, You discover the shadows & also make them disappear. That's how u go back to your king chair and than your word becomes a law, your belief creat real reality. Only by love, forgivness and faith we r able to go Home.

@rocketman_9390,"Perception is a individualistic human necessity. Access to everything  is the key.  tho its extremely dangerous  But even more so, is allowing the fear of danger to stagnant the system from its valued faith. If your happiness calls for you to reach a goal like achieving a level of status in a society or a job title,  then you vigorously put one foot in front if the other. If every step takes you 3 backwards and ten years to achieve then you'll  eventually realize even if success is achieved then happiness wont equal the happiness it would have if the system granted you happiness when you desired it from the initial thought. Because struggle is only valuable as an example. Not as a everyday reality. This system will test your ability to overcome and evolve love &happiness into a societal collective of vibrational resonation  so the sigularity can demonstrate this vibration to her being.  thus upgrading the multiverse. Never being able to achieve happiness is my nirvana, just my father in my life, absolute disfunction in every aspect of all the functions society mistakingly deems essential in a persons life. You are wrong to think experience and entitlement should be earned. If you are the key product of failure in this societys  function and your not allowed to be a copy of the systems nuerons and you try harder than anyone and never give up then you are the evolution.  i will walk the path of jesus without fear , doubt or happiness because i was born to configure the system so society will function not as one. But as a system to allow an individual to achieve there desires and dreams without it taking the Time to allow the desired happiness to fade due to the turbulence it induces on the desirer and the granters because of the time it takes this pathway to fire. And this is systemic evolution. Increasing the connections of neuropathways so the time it takes for one to live the life they desire is manifested at the earliest age possible. so one can live there fullest desired life from the moment they desire until they expire. Ones who walk the path of evil will get recycled  into a  possitive pathway by the system upon evaluation of the initial desire.",4년 전,1,

@VonBinde," @najothelwulf1367  Sure, I agree with what you say. My own view is that I'd like to be exposed to as many ideas as possible, so that I can make up my own mind. Most people have never heard what JP teaches. For example, Western society has rewarded a group identity + victim mentality for a while now and that is what universities and the mainstream media push too. So his message of personal responsibility might be literally biblical in terms of how old it is, but in our current context it is quite refreshing.",4년 전,0,
@najothelwulf1367," @VonBinde  personal responsibility is great.  Something I fully promote.  But I dont really see that he promotes, personal responsibility.  Though he might think he does. And mind you, I dont feel he has ill intent with anything he does. In fact I feel he has the best of intentions.  Hes someone who really wants to see positive change in the world. But he is also someone who's mind is filled with ideology, that taints everything he does. Without going into too much detail. He advises that personal responsibility is finding a way to function within the framework of society.  Which is not, personal responsibility. Also, while the victim mentality is annoying.  It is the extreme of something far more subtle and pervasive.   Just as stereotypes are exaggerations, and have roots in reality.  The victim mentality has truth to it, if you dig  deep enough.  His message demonizes, not just the extreme complainers. But anyone who says what is, is unfair.  And prevents honest analysis and conversation on the sickness in our society, that gave birth to the mentality. Another example I'll give, at risk of severe backlash.  Is the recent buzz about pedophile rings in the ranks of societies elites.  The conversation focused entirely on rooting out and punishing pedophiles.  And never on, what it was/is about our society. That has spawned so many pedophiles in the first place. Like the way western medicine focuses on treating symptoms of disease.  And never the root cause of disease.",4년 전,0,

@I_scooter_fast,"Totally agree with the initial post here. There's something just riveting that cannot be contained or explained or nailed down exactly about watching/listening to Dr. Jordan Peterson speak. His existence is honestly something that gives me hope for humanity and continually CONTINUALLY inspires me without fail. Somehow anytime I listen to him , I walk away with multiple new nuggets of truth and kernels of wisdom which I then wrestle with and chew on for the rest of the day/week/month/even years sometimes. This man's brain is just a gift from God and I pray for him always to get to know Christ in a way that (don't attack me here, this is just my perception after having seen hundreds of interviews & talks of his), — but I don't believe the way he conceptualizes or relates to the actual person of Jesus Christ is exactly what most Christians (the ones who have gotten what the Bible is saying right at least), — I just haven't yet seen that he has accepted certain realities of that version or concept of Christ. I'm not saying he doesn't have religious sentiments. He obviously believes in a higher good and in the concept of value and that there is something strange profound and mystical and even religious about our every day lives and the experience of being a person on earth. But I am just saying  that I will continually pray that he be moved and have whatever experience or revelation that he personally needs on order to make the final step and accept/conclude/surrender to the exhistance of an all living God , the God of the Bible, the God who sacrificed his son so that we could all avoid damnation and enjoy eternal life in that God's presence. I'm sure some people will disagree with me and claim that ""oh no , Jordan is a Christian, it's written all over his biblical lecture series. How could someone lecture like that on the word of God and Not be a Christian?!""....well these people should also note that when he is asked about whether he Believes in God, his answers don't at all line up with the simplicity that would come out of the mouth of a true believing Christian. And no that is not a consequence of his superior intellect or that he thinks about spiritual things on a deeper level than us mere every day people. No. For any and all people, no matter where they land on the spectrum of IQ/intelligence, this answer really (if they are indeed a true Bible believing actual Christ following God fearing Christian) would simply be a YES. YES I BELIEVE IN GOD. or Yes I have a relationship with the creator and I have come to know his son Jesus who is King of all. This is not at all an attack on Peterson. He is on his own journey and I'm sure a person with a heart as amazingly big and beautiful as his will come to this realization eventually. I mean, God made this man so bright and articulate and his lectures have brought many people back to church ! So yes I believe God smiles upon his work , and obviously God loves all of his children but yes there is lots of goodness and a sort of spiritual essence emanating from his talks a lot of the time. That is all great.. I am simlly pointing this out bc I'm sick of hearing true well-meaning christians talk about Dr. P as though he is a devout 100% believer in Jesus. What he actually says (quite frequently in fact) is that ""he acts as if God exhists"".......that right there PRETTY MUCH is saying that he is either skeptical that He does exhist, or quite sure that He does not exist at all. People just want to believe Jordan has a relationship with Christ bc it fits better in their head as the story of who this man is.  Like they want him to be some kind of posterboy or spokesperson that can represent Christianity and actually in a positive way. The fact is just that He really is not technically truly what I consider to be a real Christian. And tbat is NOT a criticism or judgement of him. I am not saying he is somehow a villain for not having fully converted yet. I simply wish to clarify to people what his beliefs are and are not, and to clear up all this stuff I see online about him being a freaking Christian. Like it's like people just assume it and have no idea what they are talking about. Just bc someone read the Bible that does Not make them a Christian. Followers of Jesus know this. The ones that pay attention and obsess over JBP's lectures and work the way I do out of fascination, admiration, and appreciation will know exactly what I mean and they will have noticed these comments online too and will also note the inaccuracy of such misunderstandings of so many many well meaning (assumedly) Christian folks out there.   Point is not to denegrste Jordan or even call him out for what he does or does not believe or adhere to. All I'm saying  is that if you are a follower of Jesus and a fan of Jordan Peterson , your prayers for his faith to be fully formed are needed and can make powerful changes so don't stop praying for him bc he is an amazing great one of a kind beautiful human soul but he needs a savior and to come to FULL and ACTUAL acceptance of the Biblical truths (the gospel) just as much as any of us sinners down here on earth.  He has integrity and the heart of a lion. His mind is fascinating and he is a blessing to get to listen to on YouTube! His exhistance makes my life unquestioningly and exceedingly better and more fulfilling. Sometimes I'd even say his exhistance feels like it makes life more worth living, just to make it clear how huge of a fan I am of him. So don't read this as a dig on him in any ANY sense. Quite the opposite. I would like to see him in heaven one day. I am certain God has plans to reveal himself in more fullness to Jordan in just such a way that is just what Jordan would need it to be to be  convinced. All I'm saying is I will never stop praying for you Dr. Peterson, not only for you to receive Jesus fully as your Lord and savior and to start to have those bible stories run through your veins in new and exciting ways that they can actually literally only do for those once they are a believer. That is the work of the Holy Spirit. Some truths are only able to be revealed to people once they  truly have faith. I love you Dr. Peterson. I mean I really really am glad you are here on this planet the same time that I am, and I appreciate the work you do more than I can ever express. You give me hope for humanity. But those words fall flat to how my heart and mind truly feel when it comes to what you've done in this world . Thank you for doing all you can and for making the world a  better place. You're awesome. I really really love you and will never cease my prayers for God to shine his light on you in whatever way you need that will speak to your heart the way He has spoken to me and  many other TRUE TRUE believers out there.  Actual Christians will know what I mean.    Stay you. Peace from someone who's heart and mind you've set on fire and is just grateful to have the internet and a phone to get to watch you anytime I want. What an absolute blessing. Cannot thank you enough . Cannot thank God enough for all he has done for me including bringing my awareness to your work.. peace be with you and your lovely family.    P.S. - sorry for this insanely long post that I'm sure no one will read the entirety of.   I'm coming out of some trauma and mental breakdowns and bad night and so my brain is a little foggy so I hope this wasn't too convoluted or hard to read or redundant. I did my best to be clear about what I mean as to not be misinterpreted about what Jordan needs prayers for. He's great and we love him and he is close to where he needs to be with the Lord , but just needs to be pushed over the edge so to speak a little bit — OR THATS WHAT IVE GATHERED OR BEEN ABLE TO ASSESS AT LEAST FROM THE MANY snippets articles, videos, lectures, and interviews I've devoured of his material. I don't know the man personally. So also please don't attack me or go there bc I'm not making assumptions I don't claim to KNOWWWWWW what is in Dr. Peterson's heart bc only God can know that. But from all that I've read watched or listened to of him, these are my best guesses and I still do think he needs that final push to affirm his faith so everybody get to praying and I truly think it will make a big difference in JBP's life!!!!!",2년 전,1,

I can't help wondering whether his recent struggles are the consequence of living such a public, high-powered life.  I also wonder about some of his medical decisions that might be related to his intellectual views.  In my opinion, it's very important for anyone so thoughtful, smart and concerned with causation and truth that they do not get ahead of themselves, intellectually.  Personally, I feel Dr. Peterson would do well taking some of his own advice and rely on the competence from established academic heirrarchies when he ventures outside of his own field ambitiously.  Like most academic disciplines, evolutionary biology has rich theoretical traditions which, I believe, are very important for him to grasp (including practically, i.e. beyond a philosophy/history of science level.) Not just for extending his views from psychology into philosophy and neurobiology, but also possibly for informing his own medical decision-making.  Because of the great depth and breadth of its subject matter, evolution is loaded with both entrenched, gate-keepers and fringe charlatans, a neo-Darwinian minefield.

It’s either a subtle ignorance or a subtle gaslighting or both, but some (not all) of the underlying beliefs/ideas/opinions shown here are in fact dangerous, or at the very least, not fleshed out enough to protect listeners from misinterpretation. It plays into this whole super-subculture of like centrist libertarianism and self-help and historically selective narratives and omissions, pseudoscience, and sort of oddball charlatan philosophy billed as highly evolved social theory and critical thought. The problem for me is that there’s some nuance to my position in that I agree with bits and pieces, but strongly disagree and am appalled by the just complete lack of skepticism both between Tim and Jordan and between them and the audience in regards to some of the discussion.

There was some legitimate, proven science and good personal psychology advice on the part of Mr. Peterson, but I also (personally believe) that there was way too much of what I tried to describe in my first comment. My main issue is that there's no accountability. Just from reading the comments it looks like many of the hundreds of thousands of people who consumed this content just ate it up without batting an eye. It's like people hear from guys like this (assertive white male experts in their fields), and just assume none of what they say could be false, misconstrued, conjecture, gaslighting, or anything to question.  I do think Peterson is extremely intelligent, full of profound wisdom and interesting ideas and psycho-emotional awareness/insight that could help anyone understand themselves and/or the world better, but I also think the sheer deference people give to him and the lack of thoughtful critique of some of the things he says is worrisome.

@thepreacher6648,"Peterson says (1:11), ""What do you mean by true""?  Well that is easy, as we go to the bible to open up all matters of life we find that question asked by Pilate who said to Jesus, ""What is truth""? (John 18:38).  He was told prior to that by Jesus Christ as found in v37, ""Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.""  Now, just like Pilate asked 2000 years ago as he was starring right at GOD manifest in the flesh, That is what YOU say is truth, but I do not want to HEAR your voice, for I am only interested in hearing mine.  Jesus Christ is the WAY, the TRUTH and the LIFE and no man can ever understand life until he comes to the living water of life through faith.  Peterson and most of you are just waddling in darkness, the big dragon with fire (Again STEALING from the bible- Job 41 cf. Isaiah 27:1!) trying to destroy you (AGAIN stealing from the bible, like a thief- John 10:10).  Either Jesus Christ is the Son of God that can save you from your sin or a ravening manic doing great things for men, while pushing them in exposing their religious hypocrisy in order to kill him, for ""who hath convicted me of sin?""!  Peterson is ignorant of the bible.  He cannot even grasp the simple concepts of Cain and Abel, for Cain killed able because God did not accept his ""fruit stand"" religion, but he accepted the sacrifice of Abel.  And just like any religion of the world, when you step on it with the truth, the zealots will want to KILL you (Cain, Catholics, Muslims, Hindus, Eastern religions, etc.).  The God of the Holy Bible will not accept any mans ""religion"" (Remember Marx!), for ""there is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death""!  Come to Christ with a repentant heart, and ask him to save you from yourself.  The Spirit of God will transform you into a new creature.  It is truly the greatest miracle of God and he will help you thereafter with the healing process of dealing with your sins rather than hiding from them like Cain.",4년 전,1,

@thepreacher6648,"Quote for Peterson (~ 57 min mark)- ""The deepest questions are religious questions and the Bible is the best answer we have"" is nothing but vain hypocrisy coming out of his mouth.  Peterson does not get it.  If he actually believes what he said, then the is bible is the truth and is FINAL AUTHORITY on ALL matters relating to life.  But instead, he spends more time in vain philosophies of men who stole them from the word of God and incapsulated them in ""doctrines of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ"" (Colossians 2:8).  His neurotic bent on all the philosophies of mankind has created a bunch of unanswerable questions to life ""for much study is the weariness of the flesh"" (from the greatest book on man's view of life written by Solomon- Ecclesiastes).   The Bible is not a ""religious"" book, but rather it is the ""MIND of God"" that puts all things into perspective concerning mankind and all other created creatures within his universe of ""stars"", but focusing on the only living plant of beings, the Earth.   God of the bible is a balanced being who allowed man from the beginning to make choices and as a result the only way to fix the continuous cycle of the sin and destructive nature of mankind was for one, God manifest in the flesh, Jesus Christ to take the corruptions of sin (imputed sin on all mankind- Romans 1-5) upon himself so that mankind can have a way of escape from the righteous judgment of God against a man's soul (the imputed righteousness of Christ).  He is the mediator between God and man, so rather he can be your Advocate and not your Judge, ""Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"" (Genesis 18:25).  Peterson has no answers for death or life.  He has no idea how to control the chaotic mess that mankind continually finds itself in.  Religion is NOT the answer, for it was ""the Jews religion"" through envy that killed the perfect God-man because he kept pointing to their continued HYPOCRISIES of life!  Marx nailed it when he wrote that ""religion is the opiate of the people""!  It can produce a few moral individuals, but what it mostly produces are those who justify their sins and allow themselves to do almost anything, even against their conscience trusting in ""their religious"" idolatries to justify their perverted actions.  The bible has all the answers concerning death, the judgment and eternal life.  He that was from the beginning, the one who inhabits eternity came as the God-man, the Lord Jesus Christ to be the sacrifice for the SINS of mankind, and by calling upon the name of the Lord, can give you life eternal (John 3:15-16, 17:3, Romans 6:23 and 30 other verses).  ""Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.  For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil (Ecclesiastes 12:13-14)"".  His greatest commandment is to love God and you can only do that by loving his Son by trusting his finished work on cross for the redemption of your soul.",4년 전(수정됨),1,

It's actually all about the experience. And sure, it's great fiction, but historicity of his Arhipelago Gulag work,  is quite frankly, dubious. There are instances where it's not only not historical, but outright deceitful, such as when the revolts of Ukrainian Nationalists were claimed to be entirely peaceful. Those were documented as some of the most bloody and violent, where not only the guards but other prisoners too were murdered if they refused to cooperate. The guy's whole critique of Marx is based on a tiny pamphlet called ""The Communist Manifesto"". Jordan peterson thinks he can critique Marx and Engels when he has never even read The Capital or any other of their multiple works. And sure, I do agree with a lot of things he says, and I find many of his sentiments well observed such as ""the truly moral individuals - you don't mess with them, they are capable of being reasonably dangerous). However he so badly lacks humility that he has practically never answered a question with ""I'm not an expert in this field"", but rather started raving on his side on the matter, often completely ignorant and  uninformed,  and factually erroneous. I like him in many ways, but also in many ways I find him repulsive, this whole guru aspect, with giving ultimate life advice to young men, - totally unwarranted and wrong on so many levels. And him getting into Dostoyevski early also sheds light on his totally erroneous line of reasoning where he ties morality's origins to religious thought, when all available research in Behavioural Science suggests that morals evolved independently of religiosity. He is quite a character, that's for sure, but you definitely need to take him with a pound of salt. Some of his classification is also strange. Cocaine is a stimulant. It's a TOPICAL analgesic, which is starkly different from a systemic analgesic like Diamorphine (Heroin). However, more importantly Cocaine is a CNS stimulant, a sympathomimetic, whereas Heroin is a CNS depressant, totally opposite systemic actions.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

Once it was plugged, things would be ok and you'd be complete again for a while.  But the drugs would only plug  the hole for a short while and eventually, through insanely repeating this process over and over, year in and year out for decades maybe, always expecting that it would eventually work,  the hole would only  grow bigger and get worse .This would be a never-ending spiral of futility into the abyss.  His suggestion was to try to fill the hole instead with love, compassion, understanding and gratitude, with good deeds to others, by being humble and having acceptance.

@johnbarrett5229,"It's worth nothing that Dostoyevsky's works have multiple translations. For Crime & Punishment, there is ONLY ONE excellent translation and that is by Sidney Monas. I had the great pleasure of contacting Mr. Monas many years ago and conversing briefly with him about his translation. I mostly wanted to thank and praise him and he was a gracious receiver of that praise. After that event I went and found another translation of Crime & Punishment at a local bookstore. I sat and compared them and the difference in prose was shocking! I don't have either of them here but for example, the mediocre translation might have read: ""On a cold day he walked toward the bridge"". But the Monas translation gave the whole book such wonderful life (and darkness): ""It was a bitter day that found him approaching the bridge"". I'm not giving this much in the way of creativity and I'm neither a Monas nor a Dostoyevsky.  Get the Monas translation in paperback - you'll love it. I read it when I was in a pretty deep depression and I remember identifying with Raskalnakov and how he fumbled around in his own mind. I never axe murdered anyone however, so that's a good thing I suppose.  Thanks Tim and thanks Jordan and Jordan I'm very grateful to see you and your mind doing well.

@marcstrusa,"Openness:  Matthew 11:25-30  At that time Jesus said, “I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and have revealed them to infants. Yes, Father, for this way was well pleasing in Your sight.  All things have been handed over to Me by My Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father; nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son determines to reveal Him.   “Come to Me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.   Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.   For My yoke is comfortable, and My burden is light.”  I Corinthians 9:19-24 (NASB)  For though I am free from all people, I have made myself a slave to all, so that I may gain more.    To the Jews I became as a Jew, so that I might gain Jews;   to those who are under the Law, I became as one under the Law, though not being under the Law myself, so that I might gain those who are under the Law;  to those who are without the Law, I became as one without the Law, though not being without the law of God but under the law of Christ, so that I might gain those who are without the Law.  To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak;   I have become all things to all people, so that I may by all means save some.   I do all things for the sake of the gospel, so that I may become a fellow partaker of it.  Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize?  Run in such a way that you may win.  II Corinthians 1:2-12 (NASB)  Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort,  who comforts us in all our affliction so that we will be able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.     For just as the sufferings of Christ are ours in abundance, so also our comfort is abundant through Christ.     But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation;   or if we are comforted, it is for your comfort,   which is effective in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer;    and our hope for you is firmly grounded, knowing that as you are partners in our sufferings, so also you are in our comfort.  For we do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, of our affliction which occurred in Asia, that we were burdened excessively, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life.    Indeed, we had the sentence of death within ourselves so that we would not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead,    who rescued us from so great a danger of death,   and will rescue us, He on whom we have set our hope.  And He will yet deliver us,  [if] you also join in helping us through your prayers, so that thanks may be given by many persons in our behalf for the favor granted to us through the prayers of many.  For our proud confidence is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and godly sincerity, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially toward you.  Hebrews 2:17-18 (NASB)  Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brothers so that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.  For since He Himself was tempted in that which He has suffered, He is able to come to the aid of those who are tempted.  Hebrews 4:14-16 (NASB)  Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let’s hold firmly to our confession.   For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things just as we are, yet without sin.    Therefore let’s approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace for help at the time of our need.",4년 전,0,

@marcstrusa,"Psychedelics  I believe micro-dosing psilocybin with ground chaga, cacao, reishi and cordyceps can unlock healing from trauma.  One eighth of dried ground mushrooms is mixed with the other components and divided into 10 doses.  One dose is taken every 3 days.  I've heard it explained that chaga is the king of mushrooms while psilocybin mushrooms are the jester.  The jester can be kind and make you laugh but he can also be cruel and make you cry.  However, when the king is in court the jester behaves.  As such, chaga works to prevent bad (terror filled) experiences and keep the psilocybin in the medicinal zones.  Cacao is said to have similar effects while the reishi and cordyceps aid the development of new neurral pathways.    Micro-dosing  also limits the potential of terror experiences while helping produce permanent healing without being too powerful and overwhelming.  I believe micro-dosing THC with sufficient CBD and Terpenes can have similar affects.  One can make a base chocolate using cacao, coconut oil, ghee, sea salt, and honey.  Medicinal mushrooms (non-psilocybin) plus THC, CBD and Terpenes can be added to create pieces with the desired cannabinoid ratios.  2.5/2.5 mg or 5/5mg are a good medicinal dose.  5 pieces throughout a day would only be 12.5 to 25 mg of THC whereas one joint is easily upwards of 200mg THC. Adding adaptogenetic herbs like ashwagandha may increase healing.  Maybe people can add dried, ground cannabis like any herb.  1 tablespoon in a pot of sauce may be all people need to help them maintain balance while ingesting miniscule amounts of THC per serving.  Genesis 1:29 (KJV)  And God said, “See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food.   Unfortunately, THC levels were bread up for so long while CBD levels were bread down thus making usage often detrimental.   However, research indicates CBD mitigates the psychotic effects of THC.",4년 전,0,

@joshuachapple3414,"I feel like i understand a lot what Jordan Peterson is saying, it’s definitely true about the conscience as I have experienced it myself. But wouldn’t it be a contradiction to live in fear of the conscience (not in serious matters) whilst the psychical and business like modern world is that unforgiving it doesn’t allow an easy path to actually transcending the illusion of the work world where working class people thinking that is all life has to offer ? I’m from the UK and totalitarianism has a finely tuned grip on the people, It’s so subtle in today’s age but people can’t realise it. Also there’s the fact of massive population growth and environmental change making everything a lot more broad scale and competitive. This is just my subjective questioning as I feel like I and others have been limited in the direction we would like to go in life. What I’m trying to say is there is a limited view of what life should be like in the mainstream culture/ thinking to the point it is creating hell for the individual thus reducing them to a disregard for their conscience 🙃",4년 전,0,

@mach_media,Hence the discord fake news has delivered us,4년 전,0,
@firecatgreg," @mach_media  True. . . and their goal is to have it fall apart so they can remake it with a bubble falsehood. Which is Agenda 21.  Hence they seek to steal, kill and destroy . . . and call that progress without progress. Because they value disorder over order and feel the price of order is to much and causes ""global warming"".    Hence the supposition of the ""science"" of the left is to create a paradise or utopia which has ""sustainable"" energy in a fixed state of some primitive perfection.  That being a system that is closed with perfect 100% sustainability and no loss in energy or heat. That is the worship of the first law of thermodynamics with a closed system that is everlasting and has not energy or matter loss. But in reality of the world and universe from both physics and nature mankind has learned that the universe is NOT a steady state fixed universe of eternity, but an expanding universe from the Big Bang which is our bubble universe which will have a trajectory of the beginning at the Big Bang event to the end at a cold expanded and dissipating death of cold death, without a creative regeneration from something outside of it. . . which would require a God outside of the universe.    All transactions have waste heat and heat is required to be harnessed to create both work useful work and structure. We see waste energy in all biological systems and even in the universe when Supernovas explode and form complex elements with more energy complexity, and higher value structures.  But waste heat happens from both.  So we don't have a sustainable paradise just a future cold death from nature with a fixed life span.  So all things in physics end in a cold expanded death.  And also in nature in any ""enclosed"" zone which seems to be like a system enclosed but most are not we have a thing like earth which is composed of a vast but fixed set of resources which include energy based things like the elements which came from nuclear-synthesis in science, but that being the mechanism of creation for those who want to talk about that.     All things in nature and physics in the physics world and in nature move from a state of higher level of complexity to a lower level of complexity and this higher level of complexity included EMBEDDED structure which includes alpha species like mankind which has many higher level heat sinks which is inefficiencies of nature.  In the modern world but in all constructs of ""co-creation"" of mankind structures even organisms in nature have higher value due to their higher level of complexity. Mankind being closest to God in our creation.   Those structures require co-operative or slave states of animals and life forms below them that co-operate or are used as slaves and fuel stock to keep the alpha species going. Even in our structures we see the same thing.  So all things are on a path of high energy complexity do lower energy diversity as they break down. And in all things in physics we see this and in evolution and Darwinism we see it as well. The struggle to be higher in life both in biology and in physics takes energy and there is always a waste energy heat sink.  And that exists in all things.   So the second law of thermodynamics comes into play. But Materialism of Atheism denies this constantly. They see no value in the struggle nor the complexities of structure when mated to ""Green Guilt"" of more value with more efficiency of simple life forms. So they are pro life but for pro life chaos of simple life forms because they generate less heat.  So to worship that as a substitute for heaven is to say a perfect world of simplicity can happen and that means the value of a life is based on it's efficiency and structure and waste are a SIN of energy wasting. So complex life forms are less valuable. Hence a bacteria or virus even which is not a real life form in it's own has more value than a human being because green guilt says we must stop GLOBAL WARMING and energy loss is SIN.   But in all religions and even in re-incarnation Karma higher level beings have more value and are a reward for being a better lower level structure in re-incarnation but in western religions we simple say ""Man is dominant"" and has more right to life.  So Fake News pushes the worship of the first law of thermodynamics and the simple and energy sustainable life of perfection and over unity, but misunderstands and completely ignores the second law of thermodynamics and energy and complexity death and the struggle for that defined meaning.   Hence they are scientific with only half of the definition of science. We are bound to the life of a corrupt or declining universe and world. There is an Alpha and Omega, a beginning and an End and we are bound to that relativistic timeline in space time and cannot leave that inside nature. Nature is corrupt or on a path of energy death and that is a fact from the expansion of the universe and the state of Darwinism.  But Communism ignores all that because they worship a false paradise of an unchanging primitive world that never existed and never can.",4년 전,0,

In it (and his other works), he seems hell-bent on ""cancelling"" figures like Karl Marx, or Foucault, or Derrida, for WHATEVER reason. Their works are way more complex than what his own interpretations seem to elicit or limit themselves to. He completely ignores the essence of their works, which were born in a completely different era. All of the references to those guys and to post-modernism is a non-sequitur tbh.

I don't think religion is a solution to the problems in our society, I think he just think it's good for others but knows himself there's no God, he just believes others should believe in God for the sake of stability of western society as religion seems to have been good for humans in our evolutionary past.

@robertvandewater4643,"People ""don't believe in God"" because Christians have failed to provide a narrative explanation of who God is and what He is doing.  If you understand that God is unconditional love, that the Old Testament prophets were sinful men (like everybody else) who did their best to serve God and take what the Bible says seriously, then the Bible makes much more sense than you think it does:  https://ajourneyoffaith.ca/2020/09/23/the-plan-of-god/",4년 전,4,
@505Billy1,"Emptiness is the promise, sin is just the proof.",4년 전,1,
@slimdusty6328," @505Billy1  that's what i see as so interesting to note about the Pirahã. A former missionary named Daniel Everett had gone to live among the  Pirahã people, and i supposed he'd fully expected to find that they'd suffer from this emptiness like what you mention (IE: the hole). A hole like what Jordan Peterson mentioned in this video as well. However, instead Daniel Everett found a tribe of people who were relatively happy and content with lives. So i suspect that perhaps the ""hole"" what Jordan see as being caused through atheism, is possibly a misguided conclusion. Maybe the ""hole"" relates more closely to the way we live in our own type of ""fast paced"" society. With all the worries what are associated. So that religion and faith would then act as a type of distraction what helps human to focus on something other than this phenomena that's been known as a hole  Also is interesting to note too how people within our own societies will tend to experience this feeling of having a ""a gaping hole within their lives"", far more predominantly during more rough periods of their lives when they'd had reason to be feeling more anxious and stressed and upset and so on",4년 전(수정됨),1,
@Superknullisch,"​ @freedom4life312  Sorry to break it to ya, but you completely missed the point Jordan tried to make. And he would probably take offense if you told him that this is what he believes. Also that last part of your comment..

I SERIOUSLY hope this isn't what you're believing and telling people, mate..😳😬🤣🤣🤣🙄😏😏  Here's a tip.. watch Peterson vs Dillahunty. One of the first things Jordan declares in this debate, is that the Bible OBVIOUSLY got the whole origin part wrong, aka the Genesis chapters. Time code: 7:48 – 9:25 (and more exactly 8:20 – 8:44)  What he transfers to next, is interesting too 9:25 -10:17 But that doesn’t mean that all of the Bible or any other holy book got it all or mostly right. No, on the contrary, most of it, is way off and many times really fucced up. Why? Because it seems to me and many others that the Bible (both old and new testament) was written by both “hippies“ of the time. Some wise men. And pure, sadistic, power hungry, psychopath’s that in the end - which usually have been the case all through human history – got to decide what would remain in the book and what wouldn’t.",4년 전(수정됨),1,

@Svdgskjszgjsk,"A lot of people aren't very deep in how they think about God, they either think he's a low resolution sky daddy caricature or he has to be exactly as the Bible says he is through the totality of each Bible verse which mentions his features. Which is why on its face the quote seems so easy to disprove. It's also why people abhor the classic Peterson vid where he's asked if he believes in God and he completely takes the question apart rather than give a unidimensional yes or no. At the risk of sounding like a gatekeeper, it's a gnosis thing. You won't really get it until you have a profound religious experience where God gives you the corresponding apprehension, and even then it's a mere preview.",4년 전,3,
@publius5128," @Svdgskjszgjsk  100%. Every religion and spiritual belief system that has ever been for formulated by humanity has been an attempt to make materially cognizable/ sensible, the ineffable totality of totalities. Religion at its best is a very low resolution and often quite flawed and even counter productive endeavor in regards to achieving this goal. It's why ultimately each individual must find their own path to ""God"". There is no one, unifying truth that can be revealed to all people, in a manner that answers all questions, quells all doubts, and that all people can believe in and practice.  Once I realized this in my own way, in my own time, my mind opened up and I began to understand that the whole atheist vs. religious ""believer"", science vs. religion/spirituality dichotomy was false, and trying to ""prove"" the existence of God was impossible and pointless. It's found within, and when one finds it, it's quite liberating.  I think paying attention to some of Jung's insights really point in the direction that can lead to intuitive grasping of some of this, which is why Peterson is so fond of him. It's easy to see why more materialist/rationalist types would take issue with what Peterson says, especially the borderline obtuse, autistic ""new atheist"" types that hang their hat on straw man fencing, like Dillahunty and Harris. They're both extremely good at reductive argumentation, where they can deliberately ignore or be unwilling to engage in any abstractions (Harris even goes so far as to dismiss quantum potentialities by calling it ""quantum spookiness"") or symbolic representation as a sort of ""tool truth"" that uncovers deeper implications to be pondered. They reduce everything into materialism and ostensible ""scientific consensus"" and then play word games and use debate rhetoric to throw meat to the people listening that already have their minds made up on the matter, and who have extremely rudimentary ideas about religion/spirituality/metaphysics/the transcendent to begin with. They preach to their own choir. Peterson was brave for debating them, but it was bound to not look too good for him, since as good of a speaker as he is, he isn't the best (no one really can be in such constraints, if at all) at conveying all of this clearly, because it can't be. Let alone against people that effectively have careers formed out of sparring with ideologues and fundamentalists. I digress however. I used to really respect Harris in particular, but he over the last few years in particular has revealed his limitations to me.  For me personally, I was never religious when I was young, and wasn't raised in any belief system outside my parents being nominally lukewarm Catholics. I had my own sense of belief and prayed when I was younger, but never was too serious. I had my own intuitions about things when I was very young, but I never went to church or anything. By the time I was a late teen however (after having read a LOT about science and history) I had become a hardcore atheist/anti-theist. A misanthrope. I had learned all the evils of the church, and how many failed prophecies there seemed to be, and how many logical fallacies there is in the Bible, how much the New/Old Testament contradict one another. So thats all I needed to dismiss it all as bullshit. Now that I'm older and have read a lot of Jung, the Nag Hammadi library, the Bhagavad Gita, a lot of occult works, etc, I have had many of my decades old intuitions validated and fleshed out, FOR ME, and my belief has returned.",4년 전(수정됨),2,

I am polar opposite to an opinion JBP had about world population, on reflection, because he answered a question he probably just had an opinion on and not a great deal of knowledge.  In hindsight he probably has not given it much thought.  That doesn't automatically mean he is wrong about things in his field of expertise.

Watching pseudo intellectuals is very tiring, round and round and round they go, never getting anywhere nor even knowing where they go.   The deepest of values Mr JP are METAPHYSICAL NOT religious <-- this is what you need to understand. Religion subverts metaphysical truth and substantiates an allusion to benefit, as an off shoot of its allusion to divine proximity. This is how the devil hides. It is a deception and thereby not of the metaphysically divine. God is a metaphysical concept NOT a religious one.

I would suggest you prioritize books to read based on what's important to you right now. Broadly, he writes academic books and he writes ""popular"" books that expose his academic knowledge/research to a less academic audience.   In terms of subject matter rather than audience category, he writes about general economics, political economics, the black experience, policy impacts on social problems, migration and culture, autism (he has a late-speaking child), and the failure of intellectuals to solve real world problems through policy.

The Kochs are the boogeyman for the left similar to how George Soros is the boogeyman for the right. They are just doing what they think is right based on their political biases as far as I can tell (not that I know all that much about them). What makes them scary is their level of influence.

@joshuat5140, @AmosLaRue  I agree with you Jordan has always been a brilliant man and speaks his opinions and feelings in ways others can't Jordan has never had a emotional outburst and let his feelings change his attitude at that moment no matter how much he disagrees and feels he never gets mad and start arguing over his views so that's one of the reasons I love Jordan and his podcast Jordan has my respect no matter what and to all the far left Dems and there leaders Pelosi and Biden should take notes this is exactly how a debate should be not saying he is debating in this video just saying his abilities to not let emotions get him upset like the Dems and there supporters do smh Dems will scream yell hateful shit to people that don't agree with there crazy ideas at all Dems can't debate anything because they always feel there right and someone like me that does not allow Dems or the media tell me how I can think and speak on things they lie about so idk how or why anyone would ever vote democrat let alone joe Biden??? It's nothing but showing how petty the Dems and far left are they would vote and preach to there supporters to vote for someone that's way worse than the others but Dems supporters believe and do anything there told to without even thinking about what you doing for our country? Voting someone who has severe mental health issues and can't remember anything anymore voted in office just because Dems hate Trump smh they hated Trump and us blue collar Americans that supported Trump and it's bs and sickening sadistic shit there doing fr voting and standing behind Biden who's beyond worse than Trump and it's all because Trump didn't speak to people in a little super nice voice and trumps so mean and racists etc smh no Trump wasn't the best speaker and wasn't the nicest person but Trump had balls to do and say what our country as a whole needed but Dems and far left didn't feel the same so they would rather see our country crash and burn just to get Trump out of office and that's sick sadistic shit and when we get to the midterm and vote for Biden or who ever else runs against him we will have probably 8 covid strains by then and there just going to keep saying it's mutating and we need new vaccines for these strains etc they don't want people voting in person so to get them mail in ballots and rob Americans again so they will say to vote by mail because covid has new strains etc by then smh and Dems are calling non vaxers murders and it's our fault etc and that's BS the study's I just seen showed that over 70 percent of covid cases and deaths were people that already had the vaccine and boosters shots so this I'm a killer because I haven't got the vaccine is bs especially because it's not working as good as Dems are telling us but they are not giving up on non vaxers and that's starting to scare me fr because Harris and Biden said they won't take Trump vaccine without test and approval but now there in office it's I'm a killer because I'm a non vaxer smh us real Americans that are blue collar and work and our hard earned money and taxes is what runs our country we know what's going on right now it's clear as day the worst part of all this far left and democrat BS has these Dem supporters believe everything they say and do smh Trump would be impeached if that was him during the Iraq withdrawal plan but it's ole joe Biden so it's ok to deal with Taliban and pay them for release if Americans smh Taliban already had a oil pipeline held hostage right after Biden legit in office so they flew over and paid millions for the release of the oil pipeline and I've been thinking we probably paid with all the military equipment we left smh I understand if we left just some hand held guns but when we left black hawk helicopters fighter jets 100's of our trucks Hummers that have 50 cal machine guns on them and even  some tanks were also left and it's bs and imo Pelosi Biden and Harris should all three be impeached imo or resign smh they are even wearing our military clothes and helmets night vision even all the way down to the boots 😂 not funny but I can't help but think wtf would any Americans support the Dems and Biden?? One taliban member has a 10 million dollar FBI bounty and warrant and he's clearly on this videos of the air port when they were releasing the air port smh 10 million and he's in CNN news clio later that day wtf fr anyone who's a democrat and voted Biden or even if you didn't vote why be a Democrat??? They do nothing but lies and corruption smh dear lord pray 🙏 for these Dems and supporters the strength to realize how sick and sadistic the Dems really are,4년 전,0,

While I agree with him that if you have personal problems you might try to solve them instead of committing to being a social or political activist, getting immersed in an ideology in order to avoid being confronted with your original issues. At least that's what he implies by it. But saying social activism in principle were fraudulent is utter bullshit. Where would we be today without it? And there's still plenty to be done regarding social change. Even if certain traditions may serve a valid function, we must be able to question them and to discard them if they turn out to be destructive. Traditions and rituals will always be part of human society but they change and maybe get less rigid and that's good even though insecurity will be part of that transformation. We need to find more sutiable and humanistic ways to find security as a society. Excluding, restrictive and destructive traditions aren't the way to go.

@dlprofitt,"Hey Jordan, first of all, I started half way through the video, and have not yet gone back to watch the first half, but I felt compelled to pause the video and write to you. I very much hope you are well. I'm honestly on the verge of tears just watching the emotion that you are exuding. I feel this way because I do believe in love and that God is love, which provides hope, and as Hebrews 11:1 states, ""Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not apparent."" I often think of faith as an indicator of good to come. I believe that all can be well for you. I feel very similar to you and I value your deep understandings and am hopeful for a long life of uncovering great foundational truths, and I want to see you do the same for as long as possible, and come out on the other side of whatever may be causing this suffering with great joy and victory. I hope that I am not being inconsiderate of physical ailment or other tragedy that may have occurred. I apologize if this is the case. To get back to the point, the level of understanding that you have attained may be burdensome, but the fears associated with them, or revealing them, possibly , which you seem to be considering in the video , may also be superficial to a greater good, and may also be completely fictitious or lack an ability to deliver on their threats, so it may not have significant relevance, and could be more of a test or trust building/faith building exercise. After watching, not reading, The Brother's Karamozov, the moral that hit home with me was an obligation to tell the truth, even in spite of fear of harm, maybe chaos. You are relating Dostoevsky to truth and I wonder if this could be why. At least in The Brother's Karamozov, he seems to be hopeful for a greater good. From the brief summary that I know of Dostoevsky's life, this must have been a strong belief of his, or else he was just relentlessly curious to his own detriment, or maybe I'm totally off, lol, I don't have all of the details there.  I just hope you are well and are able to express and discuss any concerns you may have with a confidant. I am fortunate enough to have a friend that I could go to in any situation that is concerning, they exist, if you don't have one yet. There is hope through all circumstances. I'd also like to bring up the idea of total surrender to God's will. This one is a hard one, but I've attained it, at least briefly, and believe it is a key tool in getting to know God. I love you, man! I don't know you or what you have been through or are dealing with, but I want you to know that I could forgive you for anything, I love you, and I value that you are around and hope to have that for the rest of my life... you're a little older, so nature would probably prevent that from occurring, but you get what I'm saying.

@alistairclark6814," @joedavis4150  I am very curious and mean no offence. When you say god, what exactly are you referring to? You must realize religion in all forms is historically responsible for the most exploitation, infantilization as you put it, oppression, slavery and genocides inflicted on man kind. It's because the immoral, unethical, wealthy elite humans are the ones perpetrating religion over the masses (I wish a god would show up), forcing their beliefs and dominating over the poor for exploitive purposes. I am somewhat agnostic leaning toward believing in a higher power but have never experienced humans behaving in a benevolent manner when involved with religion so I can't in good conscience partake in any religion. And the fact that there are so many different gods across different cultures leads me to believe we can't all be correct, therefore probably none of us correct. But I agree with your origional statement about encouraging freedom, true freedom as a cure for the drug war. Usually drug abuse is a self medication for escapism from oppression and abuse in some form or another. Also my own opinion is to never sympathize with any wealthy elites that profit from contributing to oppression or human rights violations. The Canadian government for example is fine with selling military equipment to Saudi Arabia who use it to commit genocides in Yemen. And we also sell oil, coal, natural gas etc. to the CCP who use that to fuel forced labor camps and genocides against their own people.... this is morally unacceptable.

@Scott_Bradbury,"Consciousness is balance between chaos and order. Without this balance, experience couldn't exist. Every point of view is another node of consciousness be it a human mind, a psychedelic fly, a tree or an atom and it all fits together to create balance and run this experience with the appearance of freedom of choice and the ability to experience anew. It is self perpetuating endlessly and there is no other options besides overall balance. Every point of view added together equals consciousness (balance) as a whole, also known as god or what ever you want to call it.  Intuition is the guidance we all have that leads us towards order, emotions are the guide towards chaos. Karma is the opposing force that guides us back towards balance when we go to far one way or the other. When you use emotions you move towards chaos, when you use intuition you move towards order. In the end however we all end up back at balance. Some of us take the long way. Everything in-between balance is an experience we are creating to entertain ourselves for eternity. There is no other way because without balance, you have balance anyway. With only direction towards chaos, you have destruction until eventual balance, with only direction towards order, you have order until eventual balance. There can and will only ever be balance, with temporary distortions called experiences.   We all experience everything eventually, that person who bullied you in school will be you one day, and you will have your reasons.

In 2005 a mistake or oversight occurred by my prescribing physician, which I did not catch and no pharmacist was involved due to samples being provided by pharmaceutical company to my then physician. Benzodiazepine withdrawal experience from then, and my recovery, enriched my life in terms of understanding what that's like.   I was a registered occupational therapist at the time, for a decade almost, 45, had just made extreme headway in reversing an environmental illness relapse.   The experts said you see a lot of recovery in brain function in the months after, and at a year you pretty much have what you'll have going forward.  I knew from some patients with other brain injury causes, that's said to them, too, but I would see improvement years later in cases I kept in touch with.

@Flip-Da-Script,"Jordan talks about about control and keeping yourself in check its seems it hard for some people because of the early life experience where they are not taught to care to show affection or shown affection. You have to have it in you do give a DAM that seem to the problem with a lot people. People just don't give dam anymore about each other you can see the struggle when it come to helping one another. People have been taught to fear each other by the greater society AND act on it. You want to be a better person do not be hater. Treat people the way you would like to be treated its nothing new. I don't mess with Jordan Peterson because some of his views are toxic and he has had to compromise bad behavior to sell his books. He compromises on white male supremacy some of his public lecture with feminist one of his statements i wont forget."" You can hire a woman for a (X) male dominated job but beware of outcomes"", I could not believe he said that but he did. Its the same thing that guy at Google started spouting and got him fired. You have to understand women can and do enjoy the same thing men do its just what they are allowed or ENCOURAGED to do. I dont follow jordan peterson it partly why he is not so stable himself.

@Chris_KAy,"me and my friends did dmt once after a massshooting we happend to be, we sat down in silence, no one able to talk from all the shock and hell we went through when suddenly my friend stood up and said: i know what we need to do and we all took 2 hits of dmt, me not knowing jack shit about it, but used to drugs from all the raves over the decade...  it felt like meeting god and im not exagerating this, first layers over layers of everything i was looking at were starting to add up, one different than the other, picture over picture over picture, probably 5-10 times, my eyes started to hurt from all the information my brain had to deal with, because you looked at basically information 5-10 times youre used to, but i couldnt stop looking, it was amazing, then lights or better said impulses started to flow through everything, dead aswell as alive, plants, the woodwall, the friends around me, you were literally able to see the flow of energy through things.... im quite sure this is how the idea of the 3rd eye went into our world, because it really felt like opening a new sense that was always there but locked up.  the feelins were nearly unbearable just like looking at things, the emotions were at max intake, i wasnt even able to move, just sitting there and absorbing information, while my face started to hurt from all the frickin smiling, i never felt that happy ever in my life, not even in the slightest.  then as if a new chapter started after around 5 minutes sth i can only explain as a portal opening infront of me, light in the middle surrounded with waves of lets say a wormhole. and there stood shadows... of maybe aliens, maybe humans, maybe spirits, they were shadows in human form so im not sure what to call them and they looked at me aand where suprised i was standing infront of them, but they were welcoming, no fear, they felt like long knowing friends i forgot, maybe they were watching over me, were always there just me not being able to be aware... they didnt speak if i probably forgot, or they talked through emotions, energy, not with words, not physical in any way... they didnt feel like reality feels, the environment didnt feel like reality does, but still real in its way, just totally different.  when that chapter ended darkness started to appear, not sure if they were shwoing me this or its overall just what happens on dmt, because a lot of people tell stories about a deathexperience on it and thats exactly what it felt like, im 100% sure it was death i experienced, again not physical, it happend all like an outer body experience, my senses started to shut down, i couldnt feel anything, but in return i felt calm and at peace like never before, no fear, no happyness, nothing but absolute peace, being part of everything and the universe itself, i felt complete, like a puzzle piece in a greater picture.  after that everything came back to reality it was over after 15minutes, but felt like 3 hours, everyone of us looked happy, calm, no negative thoughts in any form for hours no one of us was able to think about what has happend because this experience was so out of this world that it overlapped the negative we saw hours before,  all of us went to bed after, no bad dreams, no bad thoughts, we slept like nothing had happend and the experience impacted me for weeks after, depression was gone, life felt easier, fear of death was not so fearfull at all.  i will never regret that, this was 5 years ago and it made me from an atheist to a agnostic type person, because i cant deny the reality i experienced, but i cant call it god, whatever it is, it is there and they are many and they are friends, more, they felt like family, with godlike abilities in a realm that is here, just not accessible for the average without help or training, ayahuasca/dmt for sure is the root of gods no doubt.",4년 전,3,

We all are addicted to something, some happy drug, some great crusade, maybe just something as simple as having clean water to drink. And when the drug no longer works, and great crusade is over and we turn the tap and nothing comes out but sludge and self-loathing, all that we're left with is God, Old Age and Death.

I get a bit tired of his Jung quote about unearned wisdom in relation to psychedelics as if this should rule them out or inhibit their use especially considering the benefit to be found in these compounds. So not impressed with Jordan at all to be honest, he talks a good story but the bottom line is he doesn't walk the walk, hasn't healed himself, and hasn't looked truly into the rabbit hole.

Or in aphorism 3: ""After having looked long enough between the philosopher’s lines and fingers, I say to myself: by far the greater part of conscious thinking must still be included among instinctive activities, and that goes even for philosophical thinking. We have to relearn here, as one has had to relearn about heredity and what is “innate.” As the act of birth deserves no consideration in the whole process and procedure of heredity, so “being conscious” is not in any decisive sense the opposite of what is instinctive: most of the conscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly guided and forced into certain channels by his instincts.""

It's of course not the French's mentality where here everybody really doesn't care about those kind of considerations and people become more and more ""basic instinct"" , eating, drinking, working, having sex with no discernment.

That little post it in the back of the mind as a reminder of what beauty this reality really rests on... what it and we all are truly made of. I've been there so often I don't see it as more harmful than any typical recreational drug..just needs to be used properly and be looked at the right way with the right intentions. I've witnessed over 200 dmt trips, strong ones, only one that didn't make the person cry tears of joy and see life with more beauty. I've been in there plenty myself, dmt is everywhere in nature for a reason...it's a communication molecule, that's why Rick Straussman's subjects mostly said they saw beings that told them they ""we're so happy we've found this technology, now we can communicate more easily."" Not just that they saw aliens and it felt real, they had uncanny experiences that cannot be explained with probability or coincidence. And no Rick didn't get scared he just couldn't figure out wwhereelse to go, it's early reseach and pondering time. He did a follow up book though.  I agree with Jordan up to a point on psychedelics...I definitely don't think it should be recklessly administered. I'm telling you, Jordan Peterson himself would even benefit from one good controlled psilocybin dose in a regulated setting with a physician.  I don't like looking backwards to philosophers about psychedelics, nothing they've said is the right enough map of that dimension... It would be overwhelmingly positive for society to revisit them with more maturity...rather than ban them into insecurity, and fear them from what other thinkers feared...they're beautiful when done with the right people, in the right places and for the right reasons. Please don't let this negative view others have of them turn you away from researching the potential..male your own decisions, it seems Jordan is actually taking perspectives from the outside stories and what he's witnessed in others dealing with them. He should see from the inside before making judgements... Those ""aliens"" have a lot to teach us ;) losing the ego a bit and opening 'pandoras box' will do many so much good. Even that terror can be good to experience, those have been my most shaping experiences and have been the experiences that make me look at the world with love, not fear. I'm honestly tired of the fear stories and not the beauty....alcohol destroys lives, cigarrettes are cancerous and pointless...the poison in our food does us worse than psychedelics on the whole....makes me sad seeing such an intellectual miss this critical piece into bringing the walls down and shedding light on all the issues he's talking about in psychology...psychedelics would do so much more good than the bad he thinks...he needs to watch therapies of cancer patients using this stuff to lose their fears of both life and death, and not look at the scary side of it...those in the face of death are able to confront it with reassurance...it's been changing lives for the good...that's why the powers that be made it illegal...not because they love us.

@codyStrode,"I’m not part of the IDW and won’t be brainwashed by the alt-right mind control of this psychobablist because I’m moral and non-judge mental.;)  I do share a love for psychology and feel that his ability to argue with himself and keep composure when it’s cool or tempting to get verbally violent often makes it hard for him to connect deeply with others and feel a sense of community with others. It is ironic because he seems to care a lot about communicating and understanding others or helping the greater collectives grow emotionally, mentally, socially, etc. I have strong political leanings that conflict with his but he genuinely seems to appreciate thinking and interacting with people who are different from him without the expectation of “converting” or tearing them apart. I  feel as though It is hard to collaborate and make any sort of lasting relationships with this sort of person and yet I yearn for them. When I was in high school and college, I already knew I wasn’t a theist yet always hoped that when I met devout Christians that we could find common ground to support each other through positive discussions and meet to do something objectively positive for our community, school, etc. I would even attend bible studies and try to state my ideas on working together. However, when I tried to get anyone to agree that we wouldn’t put down or convert each other, they almost always distanced themselves or I refused to relent on attempts to change me. Ironically, it was my Muslim friends from various counties with fairly rigid theocratic governments who insisted we not make religion an obstacle to sharing healthy experiences together.  We would even check in to see if a behavior or statement was pushing any buttons, apologize and respect that boundary. Surprisingly, this mutual respect made us more curious about each other’s beliefs and cultures and we’d end up being less negative and presumptuous about ways of life that we’d been socially conditioned to more or less stigmatize and dehumanize.   No point to my story, just had to get a good rant in before disconnecting from social media for another year or so. Haha",4년 전,0,

@honestexpression6393,"I wish I could timstamp this. But what do you think when he answered a question about what books he would recommend about personal development by saying, ""I would not recommend anything to anybody"". That's the  most unpatronizing sentence an author could speak out of all the possible sentences that exist.  You know what this means? It means that his intention is always unpatronizing but his tone is always genuine.  If he was not speaking in a disagreeable or assertive way at times, then he would be disingenuous, which you would certainly not want. It means that cetain things that he wants to communicate are best communicated in that tone which adds to a level of seriousness.  But yeah as for your question, what if you do not like the way he is saying things?  It can mean that he isn't really saying it to you (eg.an audience may exist that finds him the most impactful only in that way and that is the audience he most wants to impact. And you might not be super comfortable with that tone, but can still gain some insights). After all, you should always be wary of someone who tries to please everyone. Second that he might be poking at some bitter truth which is hard to come to terms with (growth can almost never happen in a place of comfort, isn't it?), which I think is not the case with you.",4년 전,0,
@zenwarriortraining," @honestexpression6393  thank you for your thoughtful reply. I suppose what I am responding to is the fact that the information that he is conveying is so needed with such a large portion of the population, most of whom will never come close to his intellectual level. Maybe he takes for granted his rare capacity to process complex ideas, and, as such, there is a bit of a tone of condescension that I frequently hear (like, ""how the hell is everyone so stupid?). At least that is how I interpret it from a feeling sense in my body. If, perhaps, he was to work on communicating with the same honesty and urgency but in a way that was more relatable and compassionate to the intellectual limitations of the layperson, his points would reach more people and he would be less polarizing to people who might otherwise attack him and think that he has malevolent or misguided intentions.",4년 전,0,

@Hoganoutdoors,"Ketamine infusion therapy saved my life, so I question Dr. Peterson's seemingly blanket condemnation of psychedelics. I suffered for decades with treatment resistant major depression and panic disorder / PTSD. I did years of psychotherapy, and tried over a dozen anti-depressants and anxiolytics none of which brought significant relief for me. It was literally hell.  As a last ditch attempt I tried ketamine infusion therapy administered by a Los Angeles clinic run by an anesthesiologist, Dr. Steven Mandel in 2018. A single treatment was all it took. I've been free of symptoms for 3 years now. So when Dr. Peterson puts down psychedelics, I question his wisdom in this area, earned or otherwise. Peterson claims to be an expert in psychopharmacology, yet also claims his addiction to benzodiazepines took him by surprise, and that he was unaware that long term use could cause severe withdrawal symptoms, even in low doses. This is well known (Google ""Kindling""), so it's a very strange for him to claim ignorance about that. He expresses such forceful opinions about how dangerous psychedelics are, but the fact is they are far less dangerous than the most commonly prescribed prescription drugs, including the one  which nearly ended his life. I think what he fears is the insight that hallucinogens offer, insights which psychologists like him claim as their territory to defend as gatekeepers. Maybe some resentment towards a more effcient path to personal growth and wisdom at work here Dr, Peterson?  Just sayin.....",4년 전,0,

Also did i misunderstand his words , was he right and its MY opinion that needs to change? So, i found my answer... Its cliché to say he changed my life or if it wasn't for him i would still be who i was..... and that wouldn't be good.

Hes suffered alot of himself to help everyone and he has helped so many. It might be hard for him to see  how influential his words are to so many people and myself with all the pain he and his family has been through lately but if he only knew that is a ""shiny golden god"" (not god in the biblical sense im not trying to put that pressure on him) but he has done incredibly great things in his life, he is a roll model and someone admirable for sure .",4년 전,45,

So maybe what he's trying to propose with his painful yet illuminating public catharsis is that, when balance is stricken between being too indifferent, or too clingy to attention, to human suffering ,that's the key to individual and collective transformation, change into well being.",4년 전,0,

@tommarko9983,"Thanks for this!!  Great interview!  I find it invigorating!  Regarding the discussion religion and the bible that starts about 55min:  Peterson has a hypothesis as to how/why the Cain and Able story is so deep... that maybe it was somehow transmitted in some sort of evolutionary way.  The traditional ""Christian"" approach would say that it is the ""Word of God.""  I know it may sound trite, but if the author of the Bible is a PERSON- the actual creator of the universe and humanity itself, then it's really not that surprising that we find the deepest human wisdom in its texts.  I have deep respect for Peterson's intellect and general insights.  I would say that in many ways I agree whole-heartedly with his assessments of ""the way the world is.""  However, I really think he would benefit from studying the writings of the highly intelligent thinkers across the last couple thousand years or so who actually were BELIEVERS in the Bible.  CS Lewis would be a great place to start.  He may actually have some familiarity already.  But it seems odd to me to try to draw out truth and meaning from the Bible without going the main sources.  Do you think you're smarter than Lewis, or any number of other actual Christian theologians?   Here's a link to a list of recommended books:   https://www.gospelrelevance.com/2017/07/23/5-books-that-influenced-tim-keller-during-college/  Also-  Tim Keller's own books would probably be a good source too.  His ability to relate the human experience to the Gospel and the Bible in general are excellent.  I have listened to many hours of Jordan Peterson, and I've never heard him propose any concept that isn't well-accounted for in Christian doctrine.  So I really think he should take a hard look at Christianity from the Christian's perspective.  He's trying to illuminate the truth that's already there.",4년 전,0,

@slaphappybullet,"On resentment- I watched what Peterson describes happen in real time in my life over the last year, and it was because of my own father’s wisdom (who has been dead ten years) and the knowledge of Peterson that I identified it and removed myself from it (albeit not when I should have, and thanks to Peterson, I learned from that and took responsibility for allowing it to go on).  This was a sixteen year friendship, and over the last year they felt more comfortable being rude to me in front of others, being disrespectful of my time, and when I spoke up about it, I was met with a complete lack of validation. They went as far to say that they felt something was wrong with ME.  These little things I allowed to build up inside me because like Peterson said, I thought myself to be better. I rationalized we were friends, not married, so I didn’t have a right to take things as personally as I did. And after all, it was a friendship that spanned decades, should I really rock that boat?  I played that game feigning forgiveness and letting go, until recently when they did it once again, and I stood up for myself firmly, and even at a point somewhat ugly. If I would have listened to myself much sooner, it never would have gotten to that point. And like Peterson, I thought about what they were up to, and I concluded that they just don’t see me as an equal, and they wouldn’t until I made myself one. I also learned that because I allowed it to get ugly, they will never see how their behavior is what pushed me to that point. I screwed the pooch on that one, and that was on me.  It’s amazing how right he is about that, and how what he taught me about standing up for myself allowed me to have the courage to do so. He made me more aware of the small things that turn into big things and to listen to those little nudges. I’m very grateful for that.  My friend did not like that I began sticking up for myself and the lack of respect built up inside me. I shouldn’t have done that.

It sounds like you are returning from a particularly large spin out in yours and your looking for that equalibrium once more.  In answer to many people speaking here, his utilization of Biblical texts is coming from someone who is immersed in Western society, therefore it is unavoidable when looking to greater meaning, purpose and peace in life.

@72marshflower15," @realmadrid314  ~ he’s hardly the only one who’s ever lost someone they cared about. Try losing everyone you’ve ever cared about. And no, it’s not that my life is going so well to make the critique, but that I understand differently cause most of my life has been brutally tragic. Why else would I have the nerve to speak to him directly about such a sensitive topic?   I understand that people are struggling. That people experience losses. But wrongful groundwork laid causes more trouble down the road than it solves.   I honestly don’t know how to reverse the fix that JP has on society even if it seems like good stuff to other people. I can point out a few obvious errors at the beginning of the vid, but am not interested in critiquing an entire video of this length. ~  @2:57 “progressive conservative” is an oxymoron as progressive is to liberal as regressive is to conservative. He’s speaking to identity politics, ie right wing linguistic eugenics that appeals to the id/ego. Conservative to Liberal is what sources Regressive to Progressive, so combining “progressive” and “conservative” is a mathematical misnomer. They’re not even on the same operating scale. Ones a proxy, the other, a source.  @3:03 “Democratic Party member, Socialist”. Sigh.. democracy is a liberal device as socialism is a liberal construct, so pairing them is redundant. The term “Democratic Socialism” or “Social Democrat” was simply borne out of a response to another misnomer “National Socialism”. Nationalism is self obsessive ie individualistic as socialism is a collective construct, so the joke is on whoever is politically illiterate enough to pair the two to begin with. Nazis were state capitalism, not “National Socialism”, lol.. sponsored by the US Capital Establishment, a conservative entity often referred to as “Deep State”.   @4:30 Ayn Rand is a plagiarist fraud. I found museum archives decades before her time that prove it. She plagiarized a vernacular and popularized it as her own. She’s spot on backwards though. Conservatism always is. I can run the list of examples if one of you insist..  @8:55 ~ it’s not an issue of courage, but if committing said crime is wrong. What is considered criminal is often subjective, but the overall rule is when someone does something that intentionally harms another, it’s criminal. I don’t chose to not rape someone cause I’m afraid of getting caught, but because I know it’s not the real deal if they don’t love me and want it as well. JP, you read like an apologist for corruption.   @9:29 stuttering in his own inventions much?   @11:34 “a clinical psychologist” ~ a right winger that’s a clinical psychologist is more apt to suffer from sociopathology than some one who is a political or left leaning. Harming others for individual gain and likeness is individualistic and individualism sources conservatism, as caring for others is collective ie liberal. A popular right winger psychologist is someone who has the tools to be incredibly subversive to society in order to assert their own subjective ideology.   * I only watched what the YouTube algorithm suggested. I honestly wanted to give dude a shot, but his casual misuse of the terms is like nails on a chalkboard. I’ve been keeping a peripheral eye on people like Peterson and Shapiro due to their ability to fool those seeking answers..   It’s ok that he resonates with people. It’s just not ok to be so inaccurate as he is..  Glad it helps you and some others. It’s just that it’s Ayn Rand individualism that fucks America and the world to pieces to begin with.",4년 전(수정됨),1,

@realmadrid314," @72marshflower15  I appreciate the response, and I respect that you have suffered many trials. I might have been setting up a strawman, suspecting that things actually weren't awesome.   I think the main issue that people have is that JP is all over the spectrum with his ideas, so knowing his beliefs is pretty important to understand his use of terms. I have heard him explain his use of the terms conservative, liberal, progressive, etc. and I know that he is aware of the fact that words package meaning, which makes it difficult to find terms that don't carry extra baggage. I think it's important to note that he was talking about the New Democratic Party and a lone socialist member. He wasn't equating the two ideas. With the Ayn Rand point, he specifically points out that the librarian thought that JP would see through Rand. That implies that he wasn't a fan.   I think we have the same goal, which is to find truth and build from that point. If it helps, I was a Bernie Bro in a mental breakdown when I found JP. I am now a seeker, because I know enough about the totality of ideology to avoid certain labels for my beliefs (as well as the danger of drifting). I am weary of ideology because I know now that I don't know.    Given the plethora of personalities and archetypes, perhaps those following JP are just more aligned in their way of thinking, since no pattern of thought has yet yielded ultimate truth.   We are all wrong to an extent, but those acts that bring us to break bread with one another mark the point of union from which we can discover truth.",4년 전(수정됨),7,

Actually, in that regard,  the inconsistencies in his political rhetoric make me acutely uncomfortable.  It seems even JBP has a problem with it: if someone has to shout that loudly to be heard, and becomes that angry when people disagree, then (IMO) there is a problem.     On the other hand, I think he is a brilliant psychologist precisely BECAUSE of his values/moral and spiritual inclusion in his counselling and therapeutic insights  in the personal and individual sphere of Life.       We only become Angry when we believe that something we have ""earned"" or are ""entitled"" to, is threatened. And JBP is ""angry"" as soon as he starts on a political rant.

@AtheistAdam,"You post this everywhere. Don't trust him until you have read this... Jordan Peterson is worried about his reputation being ruined. He enabled legal threats against people who alleged that he acted with sexual impropriety.   Multiple allegations, not just one or two.   Allegations which he legally suppressed with threats.   All this while the sly fox talked as though he cares about free speech.   Should his defense of free speech apply to his accusers? I think so.  Let's see if they are willing to speak up — although his incel Nazi-loving following might scare them away.   He publicly claims that all cases against him were baseless. Let's hear the claims.  Imagine if he did cross boundaries with these clients. People who trusted him. People in his care.  What would that say about him?  Jordan Peterson was required to write a letter — assuring that he would increase his level of professionalism and improve his behaviour. There is proof.  Also, why did his work colleagues ask him to stop closing his door all the time?  They asked many times, according to Jordan. He also made it public that he has had many accusers — without talking about silencing them with legal threats. There is proof.   He knows that when people hear from his accusers it will raise red flags about his trustworthiness in respecting boundaries.  It might also put a different spin on MANY of his videos.  It might even encourage people to think more about his videos that discuss satanic daycare centres in Canada in the 80s. They were everywhere, he claims. Jordan Peterson just so happened to work in a daycare centre around that time. Just a coincidence?  Alarm bells are ringing.   A man who doesn't respect a young woman's boundaries is not the type of man that should be trusted to be working in a daycare centre.  Can we at least agree on that?  Maybe Jordan blames women for leaving their kids with him while they went off to work instead of being in the kitchen.  Maybe Jordan Peterson is a narcissistic Machevelian psychopath. A sly fox. The very creature he adores.   Those are the words he now uses to attack his critics. Soon he will be calling us cockroaches.   Explore his past. I dare you.  You would think that his devotees might be interested in that but nobody likes to see their guru being attacked.   His following reminds me of the Scientologists who unquestionably followed the cult-leader L.Ron. Hubbard. A man who was also a master at BS.   We need to move past an era of cult-like worship.

So I wait and wait and continuing I reminded of the rude nurse again who I'm here to see and can I go see my daughter she rudely reminds me again that they are busy in case I didn't realize that she will let her nurse know when to contact me when she's available the next thing I know does charge nurse tells me that there's been a change in her status her nurse went to check on her and she had no pulse and she had no pulse which would have been impossible as she's a heart patient has she had her heart money on however I guess that they didn't find it urgent to take care of my daughter so they don't spend the next 4 1/2 hours trying to put me on the other side of the hospital and as far away from my daughter and the room that they're in with her doing code blue and I noticed they're bringing in heaters and warming blankets and nobody will let me see her they have a guard sitting with me and I noticed they're bringing warming blankets and portable heatersfor the next 4 hours  and then proceeded to come out and asked me if I will allow them to pull the plug in since she's a vegetable and she's going to be in quadriplegic and all that brain damage and I kept telling them no telling them no I don't care what state she's in I'm not giving them permission you see what I didn't know was that she had done prior to them letting me know and they had to take that time to warm her body back up before I could see her she had a dent over her eye about an inch deep that was fixed already and she was cold and all I can think of at that moment is her begging me mommy please don't go please don't go no baby I promise I'll be right back I promise promise promise the song that came out of my body is unlike any other time I'm ever crying or or felt any type of sadness in my life I can't explain it it was like a different person in the level of devastation person and the absolute level of complete and utter devastation devastation and guilt guilt and remorse and shame that came over me knowing that she died all by herself suffocating in heart failure in the guilt and shame and regret that I still carry I have tried to replace with drugs and alcohol and anything I possibly can my whole dream everyday every second of every day that I'm awake I'm awake and breathing since May 5th 2019 4:10 pm with you.m. in a minute how hard I try to replace and hide that shame and guilt and pain it just doesn't happen every day I am reminded of all my mistakes and what I should have done it and how I should have had her in my arms by her side I have thought that I have no hope at now to better myself or to take care of my family or my father or my siblings that they are desperately in need of Financial and mental and physical help I can't move forward until this past year I discovered my mentor as well Jordan mentor Mentor in savior Jordan Peterson as well it's the only thing that has taken me and any positive forward Direction and suppress any negativity and regret and I'll sit by myself with a legal pad and write down every constructive anything that he says that I find it takes everything else in the world away and it's the first time I feel like I'm doing something for my daughter for my family and for myself since that day she died I have done positive or productive in any way for my family my daughter or myself since the day she died dying and for that he is my mentor and savior as well thank you Jordan Peterson you truly have saved my life save my life and my family and giving me hope and empowered and inspired me in so many ways that I thought I would never find again thank you truly thank you so much thank you for everything for all you are all you share you've achieved are you sharing and all you give chihuahuas and the most gracious gift God has grace me 9 years God bless you and your loved ones and all you inspire Empower inspire and believe in you sure they are an angel God bless you,1년 전,0,

Going back to 2017 when I read 12 Rules for Life the first time, I went from 245 lbs, sitting around smoking weed all the time, not doing much, taking „a break“ after the Marine Corps. To 180 lbs, happily married, (we’ve structured our relationship around most of not all of your relationship principles. And it has worked very well. People I know who have been married 20+ years have never been as close to their person as I am to my wife and we have something very special. We’ve also fought for what we have. We laid out what is and isn’t acceptable. And we have always put the well being of ourselves, our partner, and our relationship above the petty fact of just being Right.) I’m working in a place that could be a career, putting my wife through law school, putting my house in order.  I could go on and on. You are true treasure.   Sincerely, Adam Freeman",4년 전,1,

@aamark3751,"How interesting. When you're reading books, do you read backwards in editions? or do you read forward to the latest edition?

AND that it happens to be the LAST edition... and none other editions will follow? Seems logical no? That book, that has not been corrupted by men, and promised within it as such and also challenges the reader or anyone to replicate the mastery of the language and no one has been able to, happens to be the Qur'an. Please don't vilify the people who supposedly follow it, in most of the world, they themselves don't really know it. Read it for what it is and then decide. Also know that the Arabic language, like Aramaic, which the Bible was written in is that much more nuanced and therefore context is everything. Oh and in the Aramaic Bible, (it may appear in others) the name of the last messenger was named and that he was to be followed, as man only, not god. There is no white bearded man in the sky. The original Aramaic Bible, nor the Qur'an claim as such...nor is there a personification in them.

@MrGflan,"Great conservation, fellas. Tim, I hadn’t heard of you until today. I really enjoyed the interaction. I am a Christian and JP has really opened my mind to what may be possible and what the Bible means. I believe it is the word of God, and I feel these conversations help strengthen my faith, while also giving me a practical understanding of scripture. I can definitely see Adam and Eve possibly opening up their minds from the psychedelics. It’s possible. I have taken mushrooms before and it is a real eye opener to say the least. I can definitely see it giving humans the kick towards a higher understanding. So complicated.   I think today, the leftists dangerously refer to faith as superstition and that we can used science and rationale alone to figure things out. I don’t agree. I think we need to base our civilization on faith and trust in a higher power.  That we are intrinsically evil and must strive for the utmost good. I also hate when the left tries to make everything seem so terrible and that we are all racists. It’s very dangerous also. We are faulty, but we must keep moving forward and strive to be the best people we can and focus on all we have accomplished rather than dwelling on the opposite.

Why do you seek to kill Me?” 20 The crowd answered, “You have a demon! Who seeks to kill You?”   Jesus: John 14: 21 He who has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will disclose Myself to him.” 22 Judas (not Iscariot) *said to Him, “Lord, what then has happened that You are going to disclose Yourself to us and not to the world?” 23 Jesus answered and said to him, “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our abode with him. 24 He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father’s who sent Me.  John 7: 37 Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink. 38 He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, ‘From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.’” 39 But this He spoke of the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.

You endure the night and struggle and feel lost within its Grip but at Dawn the Light arrives and illuminates your Trip. by JAWelsh.  cheers and great chat Guys.....",4년 전,0,

@daviddunrud9228,"So I have had this idea for a couple of years now, that maybe Life (Capital L) is akin to the Fundamental Forces.  To get at this, I need to take a slight detour through the religious, but think about the aspects of God (Judeo-Christian):  Omniscient, Omnipotent and Omnipresent.  What were people trying to get at with this line of thinking about God/Existence?   Omnipresence (to them) is something like Space and Time... the Setting of Existence.  Omnipotence (all-powerful) is simply ability to do things (work), ie Energy (and of course, Power, technically defined, is the time rate of change of energy).  Omniscience...well this is very simply Information.  So, the Three (or Four) Fundamental Forces fit the bill quite well....they are, and in fact give us a whole new concept of, Omnipresent.  Without them, no form of Energy (including matter) or Information could exist or propagate.  Now, circling back to the original notion--Life as a Fundamental Force--this would be something akin to the Tao in religious terms (or another wat to think about it is the Water of  David Foster Wallace's ""This is Water"").  It flows through all things and returns, it does nothing and leaves nothing un-done, or some such. So, in my conceptualization, Life would interact with matter based on the complexity of it's structure, like RF energy to antenna array.  So, base minerals and such would have no interaction at all, while amoebas and other single-cell organisms would have more, plants more still, etc, etc, all the way up to the most complex structure we know of (the Human Cerebral Cortex--and we would throw the whole Nervous System in there too) having the most complex of all known interactions--Consciousness. Now, to me, this solves a lot of problems:   - The most fundamental question of Evolution: Why does life try?  - Why does it seem that often things would get discovered or invented in separate parts of the world at the same time?  - How is it that at least several times a year, I will have my phone in my hand to call my wife and it will ring and be her?   - How is it that I have had numerous, completely unuttered ideas for stories or movie scenes and they then show up somewhere in far too great of detail to be coincidence?  (not saying I have these ideas and broadcast them, but rather me and some other people are tuned into the same Idea Station at the same time???)   -It also fits in with the idea of Group hallucinations, as in that of Purple Lady from Mikhaila Peterson Podcast.  And now, it would in some way, explain the various forms of ""Tree of Life"" from around the world.    I'm sure other's would have many experiences that might fit this model as well.  If so, please respond.",4년 전,0,
@daviddunrud9228,"Since starting to listen to JP and Order and Chaos structure of reality, I thought about another similar structure.  That of Status and Change.  This is the fundamental reaching up into the societal as Conservative and Progressive.  Both are absolutely necessary, right?

Irreligion is correlated and causated with education, and prosperity in naitons (bar the USA).  For example Nordic countries. 2. Narratives (story telling and folk psychology) is now post-religion, with Marvel/DC/Harry Potter and the like. 3.  Scientific viewpoint does not exlude this, we just havent understood reality yet.

@jakestewart5899,"I know this isn't directly related to the video, but I would like to share these questions and this message with as many people as possible.   1. What do you think happens to someone after they die? 2. Do you think there is an afterlife?  3. If heaven exists, how do you get there?  4. Do you think you are good enough to get into heaven?   I'm definitely not good enough to get into heaven. Here are a few questions to test your goodness:    1. How many lies have you told in your whole life?  2. Have you ever stolen?  3. Have you ever used God's name in vain? 4. Jesus said that ""whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart"" (Matthew 5:28). Have you ever looked with lust?  5. If you have broken any of these commandments, would you be innocent or guilty on Judgment Day?  6. Would you go to Heaven or Hell?   The Bible says that ""all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone"" (Revelation 21:8) and ""Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people — none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God"" (1 Corinthians 6:9-10). So, if you are guilty of any of the ten commandments, then you are in trouble when Judgment Day comes! Do you know what God did for guilty sinners so that we wouldn't have to go to Hell?    2,000 years ago, God became a human being, Jesus of Nazareth, who suffered and died on the cross for our sins and rose from the dead on the third day, defeating death. The punishment that we deserve for breaking God's law, Jesus took in our place. He paid the fine that we could never pay so that God can legally set us free by forgiving our sins. He is just, by punishing evil through Jesus' death on the cross, while being rich in mercy towards us.    What you have to do is repent, or turn toward God, and believe in Jesus Christ. Don't trust your own goodness, because, as Jesus said, ""No one is good — except God alone"" (Mark 10:18). Trust alone in the savior. The moment you do that, God will forgive every sin you have ever committed and grant you eternal life, and He will give you a new heart with new desires, so that you will love to do what is right. You will be born again. But you must repent and trust in Jesus.    When are you going to do that?

Its not like he is in his early 20's he is old now, he should be the culmination a life lead with those rules in mind, instead he is suicidal and seeing hallucinations.  I don't know how anyone like that can hope to give advice.

@Rnankn,"Jordan is courageous for asking critical life questions and seeking to answer them in public forums. His insights are a guide for real struggles which our society has assumed should remain concealed. I think someone could take his guidance to that point, but not further. His answers for meaning and purpose are based on deeply flawed assumptions which reflect his own personal values and experiences, and they lead to very ideological positions on the extreme right. The problem is that he takes vulnerable individuals and offers salvation presented as truth. These ideas centre on gender, status, hierarchy, institutions and social arrangements are biased, ignorant, bigoted and regressive. He offers only only viewpoint on what should be an open debate. It’s troubling to see broad thoughtless agreement, because politics, along with the self, are the two sites of agency and emancipatory action.

@555Trout," @NoahsUniverse    @NoahsUniverse  I think a more interesting question is why is religion universal across cultures? It clearly must have adaptive survival advantages.   So then the next question is what adaptive advantages does homosexuality have? Or maladaptive possibly?  To think an ancient religious text developed over millenia denounced homosexuality for reasons other than adative survival  reasons is very doubtful.  I think of the kosher food rules in the old testament. Odd rules,  but in ancient times highly adaptive for survival.  I'm not sure why you are hyper focused on the homosexuality thing and I wonder why you cannot understand why homosexuality would alarm some people from a survival point of view?  It is unreasonable for that alarm? Homosexuality insures no reproduction. How is that adaptive?  I don't necessarily have the same alarm but I certainly understand it.",4년 전,2,
@Gawillamon," @NoahsUniverse  Yes and it seems most people cherry pick what they believe and don't believe in the bible, and even interpret things in different ways. I know I do. Hence why I said I'd bet Jesus wouldn't be against homosexuality. Hence why there are several different versions and translations of the bible and different sects of Christianity. The bible clearly has a lot of information coming from an outdated place of ignorance, as well as purposefully misconstrued truth. Fact: there are many Christians that aren't against homosexuality. I don't care how much you want to whine and complain about it and argue semantics. You're a hypocritical, black and white thinker.",4년 전(수정됨),0,
@NoahsUniverse," @555Trout  Well, it will take a moment to unpack all that, because there is a lot there - and furthermore what you have said is from, I'd say, a particular epistemological perspective.   Your first question is phrased in a rather striking way. ""Why is 'religion' 'universal' across 'cultures?'""   Religion? Universal? Cultures?   Is 'religion' really 'universal' across 'cultures?'   I don't think so. What must be meant by 'religion' there, in order to make sense, must already be conceived as something universal - and necessarily stripped of all of the unique cultural expressions that define each particular 'religion.' No, 'religion' is not universal...  What is said here is really something else. It is very easy :  ""People of all types from all times want to understand why they exist and why anything exists.""  This is the only universal element of so-called 'religions.'  When you really identify what is going on with 'religions' you actually find that its genesis had absolutely nothing to do with actually finding truth but with structures of power, control and authority. This is what 'the church' was originally.   Next question...  What adaptive advantages or disadvantages does 'homosexuality' have?  This is an objectifying statement, and it treats a supposed ""homosexuality"" as distinct from the individuals who are understood to be homosexual. This is an hypostatization. It treats ""homosexuality"" as something that could be caught like an illness or something that could be mitigated. This specious recourse to evolutionary concern does not give any information about homosexuality, and neither could it ever suffice to replace an individual that is homosexual - as if such a homosexual being could be explained away and understood in knowledge.   On the contrary, it is the preconceived perspective from which you speak that makes you think people can be ascertained as objects, as containing an unwavering position of being distinct from their bodies - which is a religious idea - to make people believe they are distinct from their bodies, to mistrust and feel trapped by their bodies, by a flawed corporeal existence -  It is clear from the laws against homosexuality implemented in the 3rd century up until the 15th century that this had absolutely nothing to do with a concern for reproduction in society. That is not in accordance with the history. These people were murdered in public, even teenagers and children suspected - conforming with 'god's law.'   There is nothing alarming about two people of the same sex wanting to be with each other however they want to be with each other and regardless of how long. What is alarming here is two people going against the common flow of society and doing something clearly in their own freedom - according to their own standards. THAT is what is alarming.",4년 전(수정됨),0,
@NoahsUniverse," @Gawillamon  Perhaps I am ""black and white"" in this... That is exactly how religious people are, so why not?  It seems necessary to me to express something adequately, the opposite must be worked against to the highest degree. Working toward something is a way of not lacking that which is desired. What is desired of me is a lack of oppression of thought, a lack of sexual determinism and a lack of narcissistic objectification. In order to work against this I must assume the opposition to be an unstoppable force, and I must use everything I can to bring to light the realities I have experienced, translated into a conceptual form.",4년 전,0,

@sergeantskrtskrt9594," @NoahsUniverse  If I may lend my view, I agree with 555Trout, the Bible has a very constructive and survivalist viewpoint when it stated laws in the Torah segment of the book. I don't know if those rules would still apply to a modern era where babies are not a requirement to the survival of the human race on an individual scale but to understand the context is important as well. Why did it suddenly decide to go, 'Well gay is bad' when at the period stated the Israelites in particular, (Now this is purely from the biblical view to avoid people going 'hur dur the Exodus didn't happen'), needed to grow to conquer the said territories they were being led to invade and take. Why did it decide to outline laws of holiness, garnering and making sure that their society was unified by a singular religion? That really helped them in avoiding massive religious fights and slaughters against one another, infighting was ceased the moment those rules had been laid out. With the occasional influence of politics affecting them such as during the periods of Saul, otherwise, the Temple was at times even more powerful than the King in authority. Food rules regarding pork and certain animals, the strict diet etc. Kept them from getting sick with more common diseases, the quarantine period given to both men and women when found to have broken out with disease also was incredibly smart in order to avoid such large diseases being spread around such tight communities (Israelites heavily depended on one another and were most likely similar to small towns, everyone knew each other, easily becoming hotspots for major outbreaks which are actually mentioned and are given evidence in the Bible at times). So many advantages are given intentionally and I feel like you're seeing this book from a more modern view rather than setting yourself in its history. Nowadays we don't shame gay people as a rule of the Bible but are called to love them even if they are sinners in the eyes of our God. No matter how we may see them according to our religious views due to new implications by a Messiah parts of those rules have been overwritten. Similar to how a country may reform their laws, things such as the death sentence commonly given to those who have sex outside of marriage, etc. were reformed by the actions and teachings of Jesus Christ whom the Church places its foundation upon. Now if I may, I appreciate you coming out about this topic and what you've pointed out is very well very important, but I believe it lacks a bit of looking at perspectives.",4년 전,0,

@NoahsUniverse," @555Trout  I think one of the most interesting things about Foucault's ideas is that of exclusion as method. Things in society become consciously recognized, excluded and classified and in that order do many of the most profound changes become known. It was not until the 19th and 20th centuries since Rome itself probably that homosexuality as an authentic [not a demonic aberration] phenomenon was considered. In the 20th century it was medicalized and excluded as an illness. Then it was, in the late 20th century and 21st century up until now - understood as an authentic human phenomenon, because the social conception of such a phenomenon as it was explained by the predominant ideology could no longer account for such change. Another thing that follows this pattern is psychedelic drugs like LSD or Mushrooms or mescaline in the early to mid 20th century. You find recognition in the 20th century. Profound interest in recognizing these psychedelics. Then you have the medicalization in the 50s and 60s, the exclusion  - which culminated in the drug war (acid head, frying, horror stories about people losing their minds, etc.) - and now you finally have people today trying to repeal these harmful laws and showing promising research with these substances in helping treat all sorts of problems.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

It is a very taxing subject for me, and it takes a lot out of me, but for a while now i have been finding myself trying to solve it, and it keeps coming back to me.

@NoahsUniverse," @gigid9606  I think there needs to be a reconsideration of sexuality. I don't think sexuality should be considered to be something a person 'has.' I don't, furthermore, think anyone other than you and your sexual partner(s) can know anything other than abstractions about your personal sexuality. I don't think 'being gay' or 'being straight' is even a thing. These are conceptual things, and they have their efficacy in terms of their certain sphere of knowledge, but these terms are illogically extrapolated. I think sexuality should first and foremost be considered in conformity with its manifestations - in consideration of actual sexual relationships, not in consideration of what 'relationships' generally mean in terms of similarities or relatively similar aims, goals and desires.  Each sexual relationship is different, and I think this very fact has obscured any discussion of sexuality, and I think this neglect is the root of the prejudice associated with suppression of women's sexuality and of LGBT.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

Second, clearly many people trust him for advice, so he is an importnant figure in many peoples lives and here is a quote from Jordan on being asked if he was Christian ""I suppose the most straight-forward answer to that is yes."" When asked if he believes in God, Peterson responded: ""I think the proper response to that is No, but I'm afraid He might exist."" So I think I've done my homework and represented him pretty well. Third, even if I am somehow wrong thanks for calling me messed up for giving my opinion in a place where opinions are meant to be discussed.

It teaches against sexual promiscuity in a selfish manner, and for loyalty in a giving way, or abstention for a multitude of reasons. It’s doesn’t teach forced marriage, it teaches freedom of choice.

@U2Brrr," @jalefar8247   Your whine is uncorroborated by history, unscientifically biased and childish as hell! Religions are always hijacked, Grownups know this--so we don't blanket blame any religion for everything!   As a professional in both the political science and law arenas, I can 100% testify that NO tyrant or political system in recorded history ever used true Hebrewism or true Christianity as the foundation to ""brainwash, enslave or 'devine'"" their people. Any objective seeker without a lame personal agenda need only crack open the New Testament to see Jesus' selfless love for humanity not hate.    What we do find historically is that totalitarian, genocidal governments or groups were and are ALWAYS obsessed with the gospel of SELF. That's the Babylonian idea that we are each gods and thus there is no absolute truth. Only the truth that is relative to each of us on any given day relative to our personal human condition.   NEWSFLASH: No society can long endure under this subjective relativism!  ALL dictators exhibit this phenomenon in their actions and legacy, no matter what they CLAIM to believe. The same way Hitler may have seemed Christian in some ways but indulged in witchcraft and sorcery in his private life. This SELF is evident in the Christian-hating Caesars to the Jew-hating Nazis, or Catholic-persecuting Inquisition to Mao, Lenin, Stalin, Pol Pot, Idi Amin, Gaddafi, etc, ALL loved themselves and their 'truth' more than the truth of any higher power. Thus, they were subject to no one!  Relativism rules the world today...not absolutism! Nice world you got there buddy!",4년 전(수정됨),0,

His willful ignorance of the American election was breathtaking to behold. As he said himself, he simply wants to ""survive"". That's understandable in part, but if it renders him a mouse on bigtech's wheel of fortune, why should any intelligent folk seeking the unfiltered truth listen to him? There's far too much fawning over Peterson; it's not good for him, nor the idolaters. Excessive adulation can do strange things to the recipient's ego and perception of self-importance. As a result, if and when things go awry in some way, there can be significant health impacts. The weight of adulation for Peterson has almost certainly been a very heavy burden to bear. I'm sure it has had a detrimental impact on him, contributing substantially to his recent health problems. Hopefully, he can regain good health and speak more freely about everything.",4년 전,0,

@c2farr," @antiochiaadtaurum3786  Spot on. Over the years that he has been well known, I have occasionally watched / listened to him for two minutes or so. That was always enough. This time I paid attention long enough to try to figure out what the attraction was. That attempt mostly failed and left me mildly depressed for a day, so I have banished him again.   I do think that people who identify as conservative or traditional, and either consciously or subconsciously gravitate toward assertive figures, are drawn to his simple admonitions. He offers tidbits they can nod their heads to, and can try to latch onto. But how that morphs into the adoration is still beyond me, esp when I listen to him speak. At this point it's just a phenomenon with an underlying cause that I'm not really interested in trying to pick apart.   The real issues of our day are the extreme surge in human population, wealth concentration, resource depletion, and the related surge in CO2, and ramifications of that. And mostly the fact that even when people accept the realities about Climate Change, they want to continue practicing consumerism full speed ahead.",4년 전,0,
@kylesturrock,To start with I actively take psychedelics and they have been extremely beneficial to me.   But I can see Peterson’s point.   Jung’s idea to be careful of unearned wisdom is true in my opinion. If you haven’t put in the ground work (the dirty work)and had the experience of journeying toward that wisdom you may fail in truly understanding things from a more holistic encompassing viewpoint. You may not truly understand the profundity of your experience.   This could possibly result in undesired affects or consequences if the experience is not integrated fully or properly.   Just my take.   Peace out.,4년 전,0,
@danrobinthecandyman,@kyle sturrock  I get what you mean. where I was coming from was the growth that the patients Tim was talking about going through in these trials is achieved through extremely challenging experiences (that 100% need to be integrated after).

@evertjandegroot,"Dear Jordan Peterson, As it turns out you read these reactions I want to react to some of the things mentioned here. I did experience some psychedelic trips including a real 'nirvana'-experience; I can say there is some danger in it, but not so much what Jungians are afraid of. The real danger is actually going to our Christian/Western ideas to make sense of it: the idea that we have a purpuse in life, a mission; in the case of a nirvana-experience you will think 'mission accoplished', and you might be by your shadow seduced to end life. (You know at that moment that the world is illusion, that the choises you make actually don't mind, anything goes. For society these thoughts are of course threatening, especially if you want people to join the army and that's why they are forbidden.) Two things helped me here: the lectures of Alan Watts and a computergame (World of Tanks Blitz) which is a sort of analogy to life; where I could experiment with different behavoir and see what the consequenses are (including warnings to be banned from the game). It's not that I'm totally opened now compared with what I was before (but yes, the first period you are). The experience fades and you go on in a normal way, but with the knowing that there is a sort of dimension behind the world, that it's in essence a game, not to be taken serious (but sincere though, as Alan Watts explaines); it's about dancing and making music; and that makes that you are deep inside tranquil and more open to beauty and fun. The only thing here is that others won't understand you in these idea's and experiences; but in the end that's fine. They will know eventually...",4년 전,0,

His personal struggles are a lesson to us all that wisdom , intelligence and success should not be romanticized or idealized . No one not even Biblical prophets had ""happy"" idealistic lives .We often judge those who suffer because they must have done something to deserve it .  While it is true we can bring about our own misfortune, the complexity of why and how is far beyond our ability to understand or judge. The greatest minds suffer the most psychologically, the smallest minds suffer from lack of understanding the basics of survival and relationships. We all suffer but there is meaning behind all of it. Our meaning is our purpose, to share the gifts we have with others. Teachers, mothers, innovators, leaders, builders, farmers, healers, best friends, patriarchs, matriarchs.

@honestexpression6393," @johnwise7693  Watch his I interview with Gaad. I wish I could timestamp it here. He's said that a main focus of his was to develop solutions to the arising of resentment which often turns violent and has historically led to many deaths/wars. For doing this, he's often had to crazy amount of evil (both ideas and actions). And that often angered him. He feels emotions very strongly.

@honestexpression6393," @sunnybonnell409  So I don't exactly know his views on this. I've heard that at least politically she was against a trend he was seeing in academia that made it shift radically left lead to imbalance in a lot of aspects. I am certainly sure that he would never lie about anything. Maybe he legitimately misunderstood something? Or maybe a lot of people (especially media) misunderstood (or deliberately chose to do it and present him in that way) him (mostly the case). Here's the most important part of this comment. Peterson isn't owned (conflict of interest) by anyone. He does things that he an an individual would do to contribute/impact society. You know what this means? It means that in cases which you think that he s was wrong, you can actually be sure that he is absolutely willing to change his mind about it. Or that maybe you haven't thought enough about it. The way I go about it is that whenever I differ, rather than thinking immediately that he is wrong (might be impulsive) I think, ""What if I was to ask him a question about why he said that?"". And that often leads me to think about ideas more deeply.  Trust me dude, if he says anything that is controversial (now I'm mostly talking about psychologically - and his perspective in politics might be psychologically aligned, which is often hard to find and hence useful), then there's probably a reason for that. It might be that he is wrong or it might be one of certain ""bitter truths"" that are hard to swallow. My way if thinking is to find solutions to those bitter truths so that they are no longer a hindrance. Maybe by asking him about it (I don't have that platform) or by inquiring myself.

@pitfighter871,"I have an analogy that has served as a useful option when the chaos of resentment starts to enter my thinking. The analogy is called The Mountain, or the Sandwich in a nutshell it stems from a parable about a worker who has become dissociated from his life.    He works all day in a mute way, and struggles home through people that seem morbid and cruel. His whole day is justified by his favorite time of the day, when he sits, ceremoniously, down to eat his favorite sandwich. One day he comes home and looks in his fridge to find his deliciously looking sandwich is gone. Missing.  And he goes that night without the sandwich. The next day is unbearable and he cant take it. (That nights sandwich becomes just a sandwich)  So he decides to leave. In the middle of the night he packs his bags and loads his car with all his posessions. And almost in a trance he sets out toward this foreign country, not likes he's been there, but toward it like he knows its the right way. He climbs the mountain. for days and nights. agonizing muscle aches, dehydrated and sweaty he ascends the mountain. He shuffles into the cold part and becomes a shivering shuffling blur. He scales the heights and sleeps in a tent barraged by wind and snow. He freezes in his bag and moans in pain.  That night his equipment fails him and his lights go out. in the dark, He fights for a long time. aching. breathing hard. The dark accompanies the pain into a symphony of death. The strings of despair and drums of eternity wail within him... The next day is quiet, and the morning is drippy and sunny. He takes the summit in a uneventful way.  he just stands there for a second, looks out and sees the sight.  and then packs himself back down. He flys home, drives home, walks into the door, goes into the kitchen and looks into the fridge and his roommate who ate his sandwich replaced his sandwich with an apology note about not having the strength to resist the temptation. And hopefully he can forgive him. The man looks at the sandwich and sees it.  the sight off the summit comes to mind. And he closes the refrigerator door.  The story, to me, represents how we require resetting the meaning of things to a correct context by encountering real life and real death scenarios and how this helps us maintain sanity when in a realms of superficial value and monotonous struggling.  Only then can we treat the muted threats of inconvenience and passive aggression with the correct and dignified response.  We lose the ability to be courageous and steong when the world we live in shrinks our understanding of the world. We inhabit the realm to the degree we feel like a sandwich is big deal, such minute thinking can unravel a person into a heap of nerves and all concepts of ""active in the day with clarity and strength"" is lost. However with a mountain, or something that by comparison reduces the severity of the loss into a crrect context. then a sandwich just becomes a sandwich again and not a sacred ceremony that fulfills your life. The sandwich is not a substitute for the mountain, but a strange analog or a ""summit of a hard day."" And its the struggle and the ceremony that is most real in the sense that the content therein is transposable.  And  meaning is believed by the struggle itself. And the struggle cannot feel necessary without the dissolution of self, i.e. dying on the mountain in the dark, or being betrayed by a roommate who ate your sandwich and neither mountain nor sandwich in this respect is redeems life but both work together to operate the Person eating or Climbing them..  If you can treat the mountain and the day, the summit and the sandwich as twins that only merely recycle you into another day and another climb you may then deal with it like in the novel/film Fight Club, for which he said, ""After a fight everything in life got the volume turned down, you could deal with anything."" the onslaught of the dullness of life with a real courage, or renewed strength or discovered sense of how strong you actually are but make no mistake the climb does this. the day in day out does this. you are being redeemed merely by struggling.",4년 전,0,

Peterson tried to advise the Prince first, and to punch down.  He would say that the Bible is punching down.  But for the purpose of all life flourishing. And that one discards it's order at great risk.  He has a critique of history.  He doesn't want another 20th century.  If you look at why the 19th wasn't the 20th you could credit the Bible I guess but only if you are totally white and pro colonial.  And this is why he gets hit, why unload a lifetime of obviously deep thought in clinical practice  on trans people in the midst of a hate holocaust against Muslims worldwide AND migrants?  The pathology here is this obsession ""cultural Marxism"" which is just a new way to lie about Marx.  Marx just pointed out a cognitive trap created by economic classes in any society: the poor are a caste. They need to reject being a caste.  Dalits in India exist because they didn't all convert to Islam. Marx would say they should have. Then the hateful caste society that seems to be all Hindus had in common under Moghul & British rule, can end. And we all need caste to end.  Speciate maybe, but no caste.   Reality is sadder, the Bible facilitates horror against many maybe most people.  The world was awful for white folks 1910-90, it just was, and one reason was Gilded Age robber baron capitalism finding imperial, colonial & consumer frontiers to destroy lives and ecosystems.

@victorialehrer9603,"Before this interview I watched a conversation between Sadhguru and a heart surgeon in India.  The conversation touched upon life's meaning and God's existence.  This narrative comes from Yoga and I thought I would just post it here to round out the conversation.  The idea of ""God"" is described as ""universal consciousness"" which fills everything in existence and beyond.  Humans exist within the physical realm of this universal consciousness.  Westernized culture puts too much emphasis on thought and emotions which are bound in the physical realm. There is a deeper state of mind called ""chitta"" which is able to move beyond thought and emotions and has complete access to the wisdom of universal consciousness.  When the question of the soul came up, Sadhguru said that word is too tainted and he preferred to call it Life.   Life enters the womb at 42-48 days of gestation at which point it ""tests"" the developing body for fitness.  If the body is suitable, it establishes itself at 84 -90 days of gestation.  Life enters the body through the unformed part at the top of the skull and may decide to leave at any point until the skull completely forms.  SIDS could be explained by the Life leaving the body for whatever reason.  The top two chakras (energy centers) of the body exist above the crown of the head and they connect Life in the body to the universal consciousness.  If the human lives in sync with the universal consciousness, the human prospers and the  body remains healthy.  If the human lives in dissonance with the universal consciousness, the human gets crushed under its weight.  I would really love to hear a conversation between Dr. P and Sadguru to discuss these ideas (I may not have expressed them accurately but I did my best.)  I also feel that there is a piece of a puzzle in these ideas which may help Dr. P resolve some of the conflict he is experiencing which I believe is causing him distress.",4년 전,0,

@Jemzuki,"This was interesting. I subscribe to parts of what Jordan is preaching and on a fundamental level agree on some key points he wants to get across, but it was a bit jarring to hear his meandering answers where he talks a lot, but doesn't actually get to a point, just a mystical idea of a point. He also did not really listen to some of the questions and immediately jumped in, while also did not seem to be open to a dialogue when it came to the topics that Tim was very knowlegdable about. This might just be the contrast from other guests on the show, but I'm quite conflicted in my opinion of him - there's a lot value he conveys to people, but there's also a lot of assumptions and really big stretches of imagination when trying to connect some ideas and I just don't feel confident that he is the person to be trusted with the answers.   With that said, I wish him a quick return to full health and I'm glad he's out there. Might get the new book as 12 rules for life was a good reinforcing read.",4년 전,0,

These guys come from such different intellectual and experiential backgrounds and interests, so I didn't expect much room for riffing on shared ideas; which is why this interview is such a gem.   Jordan exposes his deep emotions around his values and shares his intellectually-fed neurotic tendencies with a level of vulnerability that I've not seen before. His suffering and fear of 'the chaos' were quite palpable and Tim found little room for deeper exploration for the potential of psychotropics;  at least that day.

In recent times I had always leaned on the side of being open minded.

[05:23] Early influential books that have stood the test of time for Jordan, and what listeners can expect to gain by delving into the list of books he recommends at his website. [08:57] On the Nietzschean idea of morality as cowardice, and what we might do to cultivate courage while keeping our more dangerous inclinations in check. [11:37] Drawing a distinction between thinking and paying attention as a way to gain insight during a conversation that may turn adversarial, and why resentment, for all its ugliness, can be a valuable consultant. [16:18] On finding meaning to make life’s suffering irrelevant (or at least non-corrupting), and Jordan’s thoughts about how this perspective informs his conservative leanings. [24:10] What does Jordan feel is the right way to constructively criticize a social institution? [29:30] Jordan weighs in on what he finds fascinating about psychology and the physiology of drug and alcohol use, and what he considers to be the “Pandora’s Box” of seeking religious experiences through psychedelics. [34:43] If the contents of this Pandora’s Box facilitate greater openness, when might this not be a good thing? How does Jordan define openness in this context, and how does it relate to Carl Jung’s warning to “beware of unearned wisdom?” [39:48] In what ways does Jordan believe the world is, as he puts it, “deeply strange?” How did his son once inexplicably illustrate the chaos and order of this strangeness from a child’s perspective? [45:24] Stoned apes, high flies, and the risk of ontological shock faced by people who pursue psychoactive experiences too casually. [51:00] What might the average person in the Western world, religious or not, gain by studying the Bible? [53:57] Jordan believes that ancient stories — as found in the Bible — carry kernels of wisdom that have been stripped of superfluousness over time. When writing a book, how does he try to convey his own messages in a way that will remain intact over time to serve further generations? [59:54] How writing a book can be the meaning an author needs to keep going, and why finishing it can counterintuitively be a source of devastation rather than elation. [1:02:25] What would Jordan recommend to someone seeking meaning if they have reached a high level of competence in a certain area? [1:03:30] Why is Jordan’s new book called Beyond Order?

@appolle," @fiveDust  Yes, he is treating psychedelics like if it was something that you read about but you don’t want to experience. He doesn’t trust a medicine that has been used by many civilisations throughout history with more positive outcomes than negative side effects. It is almost like if there was a part of him that doesn’t want to find out something that is haunting him and you can easily tell how much anger and resentment there is in his words when he speaks without being a psychoanalyst. And that’s what probably drove him into abusing benzodiazepines which they clearly don’t make you confront the real situation, instead they just allow u to hide for a short period of time until the next dose. He criticised alcoholism in the past for the same issues but benzos are the same thing but prescribed. Psychedelics are completely the opposite, they show you what you need to see they don’t overprotect you. Is almost like he already made up his mind about psychedelics and his point of view is that they are a dangerous box that you probably shouldn’t open without even knowing what’s inside that box and we need him to get a bit more deeply into this world and show us his point of view from the inside. Otherwise is like that friend that talks to you about how bad your Japanese is when he doesn’t even speak Japanese.",4년 전,4,

@Flip-Da-Script,"Jordan talks about about control and keeping yourself in check its seems it hard for some people because of early life experiences where they are not taught to care or to show affection or are shown affection. You have to have it IN YOU to give a DAM that seem to the problem with a lot people. People just don't give dam anymore about each other and you can see the struggle when it come to helping one another. People have been taught to fear each other by the greater society AND act on it. You want to be a better person do not be a HATER and you know what that is. Treat people the way you would like to be treated its nothing new. I don't mess with Jordan Peterson because some of his views are toxic and he has had to compromise bad behavior to sell his books. He compromises on white male supremacy some of his public lectures with feminist one of his statements I wont forget."" You can hire a woman for a (X) male dominated job but beware of outcomes"", I could not believe he said that but he did. Its the same thing that guy at Google started spouting and got him fired. You have to understand women can and do enjoy the same things men do its just what they are allowed or ENCOURAGED to do is the issue. I don't follow Jordan Peterson it's partly why he is not so stable himself. If most people Lived THEIR life and cause no HARM that is 90% of living a good life its just that simple. Don't go out of you way to judge people accept them for who they are and what they can doing (stop handicapping people). Societies put barriers in front of people for many reason do not do it reject them. Black people were told a lot of things they could not do like fly plane or be doctor same for women. The reason why their are feminist is because men wont listen their complaint went as far as the kitchen and the bedroom or worse the hospital for HINT HINT slip and fall into a door. You want a better you better community do not be a hater drop your prejudice do not go out of your way to harm people of you YOUR OWN ACTIONS.

And we don't have to wonder when we can just ask them... or better yet- we can be deep and intellectual and eat them- take the trips ourselves. I Will say this-- on top of being deep and intellectual he is extremely well read, educated and knowledgeable. If anything it may be those traits that set him apart.... that and the fact that he apparently has an enormous amount of firsthand experience interacting with a great plethora of people on an intimate level- not only lots of different kinds of people but as I said apparently a huge number of people. This means that he could have quite an impressive and vast depth of understanding about people and their issues, about societies, knowledge about people on both an intimate individual psychological level as well as a more sociological understanding of aggragate human behavior in large groups. I think where your point becomes more relevant is where he is able to apply this vast human experience thru the lense of his depth and intellect that you talk about; as well as his passion I might add. Jordan has a relatively rare intensity and passion driving him that definately helps make things interesting.",4년 전,2,

@MtHoodExplorer," @prod.hxrford3896  very true, but the problem comes in when one is judging others by a different standard than ones self... the hypocracy. I'm not sure about this with Peterson. On the occasions I've watched/heard him he does for the most part seem sincere, well-intended and even generally caring in his wishes for the goodwill of others.  For many of his ""fans"" the same cannot be said. Many are about as judgemental, uncaring and hypocritical as you could be.  Like many popular voices, even thru history, people like the a-la-carte approach that enables them to pick and choose which aspects they like to champion and which they like to conveniently ignore...cause perhaps it goes against their preconceived notions, contradicts their beliefs or claims, or because it would challenge their intellectual laziness.",4년 전,0,

He speaks against being resentful or angry, but there is an evident discomfort in how he expresses himself. He comes across as passive-aggressive, in that he can't make a point without criticizing someone, and it's usually ""progressives"", as if he's constantly debating an invisible foe (like the point he made about conservatives being achievers and activists being resentful. Really, queen?). With his ""tell it like is"" approach, it is no wonder he has become a neocon mouthpiece.  Still, he's an interesting character (this was more like a ""60 minutes"" interview).

Activists are the ones behind worker's rights, women's suffrage, racial equality (and eliminating segregation), marriage equality, etc. BLM, for instance, has brought the conversation on racism to the table, generating many policy changes worldwide. Thanks to them, many workplaces around the world are applying anti-racist policies.
