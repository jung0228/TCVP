@Necrosintesys,I purchased both the medium https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkxfh2XUOHWYHKQYOvSq2gZ6PyCmVkTFGWz and small speed bags from Meister. I'm very glad I got both as the workout is quite different from the two. The small is fantastic for getting your speed built up once familiar with your striking. The medium bag provides a considerable amount more resistance building more strength in your punches. I highly recommend both sizes.Some people have expressed concern over the latex bladder leaking down more frequently than the traditional rubber. I have not found this to be an issue at all.,2년 전(수정됨),13,

Turned out that the students had tried to achieve this for over two years and nobody had yet succeeded. Literally all i did was think to increase speed closest possible to hitting the board for sudden impact, instead of trying to go at it with high strength and lose speed during the movement. It's all about common sense and technique. The teacher asked me to join the group after that but i had quite different, creative interests so i said no.",4년 전,1,

I have personally tried hitting one machine garden 900+ on it, then went to machine right next to it of a different manufacturer and gotten like 700 on it. They are not calibrated equally, so you cannot compare your score on one of these machines, as they are not calibrated the same.

@patrickbacher7881,He did throw a real punch.  @ihaveanextremelysmalldickb3459  is the only one who knows what he is talking about. Proper weight shift from the back leg to the front leg with a solid rotation of his body. Maybe it wasn't 100 but it was around 95 percent at least.

@rrickyyortegaa,"BohemianGroveify yeah ik he won, I knew he was gonna win the decision cause obviously AJ has more reach advantage and he landed more jabs, I never said Ruiz should’ve won the decision, but if AJ had went and fought close to Ruiz, I think Ruiz would’ve gotten a knock down just like the first fight since AJ went in, but AJ kept it safe which made the fight less exciting, but like I said, no disrespect to AJ, he’s an amazing fighter, ive seen some of his fights and remember watching his highlights but everyone has different opinions",5년 전(수정됨),6,
@rrickyyortegaa,"Jonathan H yeah ig so, and I get he was trying to play it safe cause in my opinion Ruiz has the power to knock him down when it comes to getting close just like the first fight and I’m not tryna to sound cocky but i know boxing, I’ve seen videos of boxing fights back in the 19th century, where real legends and fighters would go in and start throwing punches cause that’s what a real fight is, boxing now is a fraud with a bunch of lame fights, but I mean AJ won and it was clear that he won from the jabs he landed and playing it “smart” and reach advantage, but it was such a boring fight and im sure I’m not the only one who thinks that",5년 전(수정됨),5,

No one wants a third as it will be the same as this fight, no risks and a cruise to victory. If you can completely outbox your opponent what makes you think he’s going to want to trade blows in a third fight? As for your Mayweather comment, he boxes nothing like Mayweather, and his so called “running” was actually in fact quite an impressive world class boxing display. If you cannot see that it’s fine, it just means your a bit more of a casual boxing fan wanting knockouts as opposed to us more hardcore fans who can appreciate a good performance. Lastly if you would like me to put you in touch with a great English tutor I can forward you on to him. All the best!",5년 전,0,

Also have someone teach girls how to punch from an earlier  because lets be honest in our patriarchal society men are more likely to be taught and encouraged to be strong. See if you take something like the CrossFit games the girls and boys compete together and are essentially equal.

@علي_التميمي-ي3ق4ج,"‏The Innate Nature in man recognizes what is good and bad, what is true and false. It recognizes that the Attributes of Allah must be True, Unique, and All-Perfect. It does not feel comfortable towards any kind of degradation of His Attributes not does it qualities to the Creator. Many who became “discontent with God” did so because of the practices of the Church in medieval Europe and because of the claims of “god dwelling in a son” and the concept of the “original sin”. However, they “escaped” into worshipping a new theory called “mother nature” as well as the “material” World. With the advancement of materialistic technology others from different religions adopted the concept of “forgetting about God” and “let us live this life and enjoy it!”, not realizing that they have chosen the worship of the “original god” of Rome: Desire!.  ‏NOW we can see that all of this materialistic and secular progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to complex social, economical, political, and psychological problems. Many of those who “fled” their “religions” are in search again. Some try to “escape” the complexity of their daily lives via various means. Those who had the chance to examine the Qur’an and Islam, proceed with a complete way of life that relates man to establish a purpose for his presence on earth. This is well recognized in the Attributes of Allah and what does He require from man. He does not want man to be enslaved to any false deity: nature, drugs, lust, money, other man, desire, or sex. He provides man with the proofs that He is the One who can redeem so that man can free himself from the slavery to any form of creation and to turn to his Creator Alone. THIS Creator Has Perfect Attributes. He is the First, nothing is before Him, the Ever Living. To Him is the Final Return where everyone will be dealt with in the Most Perfect and Just way. He does not begot nor He is begotten. Those who attribute Divinity to Jesus forget or ignore the fact that Jesus was in a mother’s womb. He needed nutrition; he was born and grew up to be a man. He was trusted with the Gospel as a Message to the Children of Israel: “For there is One God, and one mediator (i.e. a messenger) between God and men (the Children of Israel), the man Christ Jesus) (I Timothy 2:5). A man-messenger calling his nation not to worship him: “But in vain they do worship me!” (Mathew 15:9). A man who needs to eat, walk, sleed, rest, etc.. cannot have Divine Attributes because he is in need and God (Allah) is Self-Sufficient.                                                           *     ‏‎‏ https://drive.google.com/open?id=10Q_WcvkBJDR3XJOqdGuIG3ri-lYA4JIO   https://www.fly-cards.com/en/cards/42  https://youtu.be/Ibz2MrW8x6U   🌹✍🏻",4년 전,0,

@ashscott6068," clint45  Nope. Those machines are not accurate in the slightest. They're not even measuring anything. That number isn't a measurement; it's just a number. And every manufacturer makes machines that spit out completely different numbers. There are brakes in the lever arm. If you don't hit it in exactly the right direction, the brakes kick in. These machines are DESIGNED to be inaccurate. 5 guys walk up to an accurate machine, they each pay for one turn, and find out who hits hardest. The same 5 guys walk up to one of these carny machines, the results are totally unexpected, the weakest guy gets lucky, and they start to argue, and before you know it, they've all emptied their pockets into it. That's EXACTLY what they're designed to do. You wouldn't measure punching power by measuring how far you can push a ball. A soccer player can kick a football way farther than a horse can.

@ashscott6068,"How is this a record? These machines are rigged AF. No two machines would give the same reading for the EXACT same punch. And it would have to be exact, because a tiny variation in angle has a massive effect on the number. The force has to be directly in line with the axle, and the axle is never perfectly lined up with the fascia of the machine. These machines are DESIGNED to give unpredictable results. If they really told you who hits harder, then that gang of boys you see hanging out by them, would only have to pay to hit it once each. But you see the biggest kid going ""Naw, that ain't right! I hit it way harder than him!"" So he pays to go again. Get a bunch of competetive guys around one of these, and they will be there for hours, pouring money into it.",7년 전,1,

The fact that they lost to an 80% Arnold should say enough about them instead of the show. In 5 years the bodybuilders hadnt developped any better and still lost to an 80% Arnold.  They should be ashamed off themselves instead of victimizing themselves. None of them looked great in 80 olympia. None of them was better than Arnold. Who cares if Arnold was 80% of his former self. Its not Arnold against Arnold from 74. Its Arnold vs the competition, and the competition was simply even worse than an 80% Arnold",7년 전,0,

Boxing is the sweet science and mma fighters and their fans need to learn that before their fighters keep getting humiliated in that ring. Ngannoo would not last in a boxing ring against any Elite Heavyweight boxer. sorry buddy",7년 전,4,
@thekeith1221,I never specified boxing at all. As Ngannou started his mma career late enough in his life I can’t imagine him having any intention of a boxing match at all. However with the degree to which his mma has improved since he started I would have no doubt he would pick up boxing as fast as he did mma. The man is a sponge with incredible speed for a heavyweight and the most powerful punch in the world. All he would really have to do is throw a leg kick or sweep Joshua’s lead leg and it’s lights out. Not even mentioning what he would do to him with a kick knee or in a grappling situation.,7년 전(수정됨),1,

@ChrischrosBelgium,"floyd was the smarter fighter and he had more cardio. He was the better boxer too. But there were some actions that I did not like from Floyd. He turned his back way to often so Conor couldn't continue the attack. he was very smart. He exploited the rules. Let's do a boxing match in the Octagon. Only boxing, but no interfering from the referee and if Floyd turns his back, Conor can continu to hit. That would make it way more interesting.",7년 전,0,

@jessicahamm8869,"Yeah he didn't put his all into that. But your right the machine is not very accurate when it comes to actual power but if you set the record then you at least have some power. It's more about how precise you hit it, of course you gotta have some power. But I'm only 150 pounds and have set the record on a few of these at the local fairs just because I know how to hit it correctly. It's funny watching much bigger men try and keep up and try running into their punches when it's best to have a steady controlled shot and make sure to punch through it not to it and it's better to hit with the straight and not a hook on this machine in particular, Because the bag can only travel back or up I guess.",7년 전,1,

@علي_التميمي-ي3ق4ج,"‏The Innate Nature in man recognizes what is good and bad, what is true and false. It recognizes that the Attributes of Allah must be True, Unique, and All-Perfect. It does not feel comfortable towards any kind of degradation of His Attributes not does it qualities to the Creator. Many who became “discontent with God” did so because of the practices of the Church in medieval Europe and because of the claims of “god dwelling in a son” and the concept of the “original sin”. However, they “escaped” into worshipping a new theory called “mother nature” as well as the “material” World. With the advancement of materialistic technology others from different religions adopted the concept of “forgetting about God” and “let us live this life and enjoy it!”, not realizing that they have chosen the worship of the “original god” of Rome: Desire!.  ‏NOW we can see that all of this materialistic and secular progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to complex social, economical, political, and psychological problems. Many of those who “fled” their “religions” are in search again. Some try to “escape” the complexity of their daily lives via various means. Those who had the chance to examine the Qur’an and Islam, proceed with a complete way of life that relates man to establish a purpose for his presence on earth. This is well recognized in the Attributes of Allah and what does He require from man. He does not want man to be enslaved to any false deity: nature, drugs, lust, money, other man, desire, or sex. He provides man with the proofs that He is the One who can redeem so that man can free himself from the slavery to any form of creation and to turn to his Creator Alone. THIS Creator Has Perfect Attributes. He is the First, nothing is before Him, the Ever Living. To Him is the Final Return where everyone will be dealt with in the Most Perfect and Just way. He does not begot nor He is begotten. Those who attribute Divinity to Jesus forget or ignore the fact that Jesus was in a mother’s womb. He needed nutrition; he was born and grew up to be a man. He was trusted with the Gospel as a Message to the Children of Israel: “For there is One God, and one mediator (i.e. a messenger) between God and men (the Children of Israel), the man Christ Jesus) (I Timothy 2:5). A man-messenger calling his nation not to worship him: “But in vain they do worship me!” (Mathew 15:9). A man who needs to eat, walk, sleed, rest, etc.. cannot have Divine Attributes because he is in need and God (Allah) is Self-Sufficient.                                                           *     ‏‎‏ https://drive.google.com/open?id=10Q_WcvkBJDR3XJOqdGuIG3ri-lYA4JIO   https://www.fly-cards.com/en/cards/42  https://youtu.be/Ibz2MrW8x6U   🌹✍🏻",4년 전,0,

@peace606,"Rolan Johnson Yes, but these machines could be different in countries, though they look very similar and a lot of people get score around 600-900 in my area.  Im sure if that boxer tried his best, he would get something like 1100-1500 or something.  Also, there is a lot of thechnique involved. I figured that you need to get as much kinetic energy around your arms as possible to get a good score. This can be done by rotating your torso as much as possible relative to your legs, get a good wave in your arm, left leg forward (if you are righthanded) and get a little movement in your rightleg,  also run a couple of steps to get more kinetic energy and adrenaline also helps :D. Anyway this was my technique.",8년 전,3,
