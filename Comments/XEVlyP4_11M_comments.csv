The myth being, ""by the time they swim around the bowl, they'll forget how trapped they are.""  A goldfish's memory can last for up to three years. ""Fishbowls"" can cause depression and even cause the fish to think it's dying. It can cause the fish to puff up because their organs are trying to grow, but they can't because there isn't enough space. It can cause constant stress because they don't have anywhere to hide.   Multiple goldfish in a bowl can cause fighting because there's little space to go around.

@Nyanfood,"I think the saddest thing about this interview is the ""I don't want to learn."" I totally get it. I make it a point to dumb everything I teach down so it's as simple as I can make it because I know people don't learn when they're being overwhelmed. But the words ""I don't want to learn"" and ""it's the IT guy"" made me feel so sad. The amount of restraint Snowden had in that moment honestly meant a lot to me. I don't have to like or dislike what he did but I can better appreciate his thought process here. Thank you for this interview!",1년 전,1,

@HarryRenner-h9q,I have watched this several times now and it's still probably one of the best episodes I've seen. John Oliver went above the call of duty on this one. and with the exception of being over an hour late. Edward Snowden was pretty good about the interview. the people of the United States should know if the United States Government. has their sensitive private information and what they are doing with it. although the dick pics are a little unnerving.,1년 전,2,

Hint - There are those who want to bring him back and put him to death. So far it's either to continue to live in Russia or return to the states and die.",1년 전,2,

Because they understand the Kardashians and because the Kardashians are famous, it makes them feel smart. It's the same with Donald trump. Donald Trump himself said he loves the uneducated. That's because they understand him, because he's a blathering idiot. But he makes people feel smart because if they can understand a president, then they must be smart. These beliefs are filled with logical fallacies and cognitive distortions. I can spend hours discussing them.

@cynicalrabbit915," @DDub04   I don't think he's been made a citizen of Russia. The reason he hasn't come back, is that he would immediately be put on trial, he would not be allowed to say anything in his defense and the only verdict will be the ultimate price .  The whole thing is rigged so they can do anything to him and no one can do anything about it.",1년 전(수정됨),1,
@PurooRoy," @cynicalrabbit915  true. The reason why he settled in Russia instead of, let's say, the European Union, is so that the government does not agree to extradite him. Russia is one of the only powerful enemies of the United States with a white majority, so he won't have much problem blending in.",1년 전(수정됨),0,
@owenr-m4619,"There's no way Snowden's ever coming back to the states, not at this point. If he were to come back, there has to be a public trial. The American people need to understand just how much information the government has about them.  I think what Oliver did during that interview was very smart. He made sure that Snowden talked to the US people on their level. I don't think we're stupid, we're just very ignorant. If you tell it to people on their level, like saying the government most likely possesses pictures of their junk, they'll get rightfully pissed. The way he framed it, he made it a bipartisan issue. Everyone should be rightfully outraged no matter while side of the isle you lean. If there is a public court hearing and Snowden is able to defend himself by addressing what he leaked to the presses in a similar framework to what Oliver did in this interview (maybe not with dicks, but something else like internet history) I think that will cause people on both sides to start getting angry",1년 전,1,
