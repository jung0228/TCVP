YOU CAN STAND ON YOUR OWN AGAINST GOD AND TRY TO JUSTIFY YOUR SIN WHEN  YOU WONT EVEN BE ABLE TO LOOK UP YOU WILL BE WEEPING IN TERROR REALIZING YOU  MADE A BIG MISTAKE.

WILL YOU CALL UPON HIM NOW AND SURRENDER TO HIM.  TALK TO HIM LIKE  ABEST FRIEND, HE'S WAITING AND HE LOVES YOU.   Turn back to God  Our Creator, not religion.  Religion creates bondage, in Christ there is  freedom.  Im not talking church, im not talking religion, im talking  relationship with your Creator.  Call upon Jesus now and ask Him into  your life and to forgive your sins.   hell is the absence of God Almighty who gives us the breath in our lungs, water, food, sunshine,  love, kindness, patience, faithfulness, hope, rest, help etc.  hell is real and its a place of torment: you will have to live with all your mistakes, regrets, you will feel all  the pain you caused others...  you be hungry but not be able to eat you will be thirsty but wont be able to drink you will be tired but cant sleep you will have no hope you will have no rest you will feel pure hatred towards you (satan and the fallen  angels/demons hate you and want to drag you to hell)  “For the wages of sin is death (hell), but the gift of God is eternal  life in Christ Jesus our Lord” -Romans 6:23 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life.

ITS NOT A GAME PEOPLE, YOU COULD DIE TOMORROW, QUIT PLAYING AROUND, THESE  ARE END TIMES!!!  TURN TO JESUS NOW! ASK HIM TO FORGIVE YOUR SINS    STOP PUTTING YOUR HOPE IN THE GOVERNMENT, IN RELIGION, IN SCIENCE, IN  WEALTH, IN CELEBS, IN SPORTS, IN THE WORLD (IT WILL PERISH!)  YOU CAN STAND ON YOUR OWN AGAINST GOD AND TRY TO JUSTIFY YOUR SIN WHEN  YOU WONT EVEN BE ABLE TO LOOK UP YOU WILL BE WEEPING IN TERROR REALIZING YOU  MADE A BIG MISTAKE.  YOU WONT WIN AN ARGUMENT WITH GOD, HE CREATED  EVERYTHING!!!  GOD SEES EVERYTHING YOUVE EVER DONE; YOU WONT FOOL HIM!!!  OR   PUT YOUR TRUST IN JESUS WHO DIED ON THE CROSS AND TOOK THE WRATH OF GOD IN  OUR PLACE FOR OUR SINS.  IT'S A FREE GIFT BUT HE CANT FORCE YOU TO TAKE  IT.  WILL YOU CALL UPON HIM NOW AND SURRENDER TO HIM.  TALK TO HIM LIKE  ABEST FRIEND, HE'S WAITING AND HE LOVES YOU.   Turn back to God  Our Creator, not religion.  Religion creates bondage, in Christ there is  freedom.  Im not talking church, im not talking religion, im talking  relationship with your Creator.  Call upon Jesus now and ask Him into  your life and to forgive your sins.   hell is the absence of God Almighty who gives us the breath in our lungs, water, food, sunshine,  love, kindness, patience, faithfulness, hope, rest, help etc.  hell is real and its a place of torment: you will have to live with all your mistakes, regrets, you will feel all  the pain you caused others...  you be hungry but not be able to eat you will be thirsty but wont be able to drink you will be tired but cant sleep you will have no hope you will have no rest you will feel pure hatred towards you (satan and the fallen  angels/demons hate you and want to drag you to hell)  “For the wages of sin is death (hell), but the gift of God is eternal  life in Christ Jesus our Lord” -Romans 6:23 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life.

@donnotworryitsjustmyself3864,"I have never understood two things: (1) the logic behind sending mean messages to celebrities the first place, (2) why so much celebrity worship by so many people who do not know them, and quite honestly have nothing to gain through constantly stalking them like a flock of hungry seagulls. It’s always amazing to see how many people send offensive tweets to famous people for no rational reason - there is no clear logic behind it. These people have done nothing to them, they don’t even know them, and in the case of many celebrities (not all, but many) they wouldn’t want to associate with them in the least. It’s a bit of an ugly truth, still truth nonetheless. Here we  have (on the one hand) an entire group of people tweeting out public insults to people that they don’t even know; on the other hand we have a group of famous people who could just as easily turn their noses up at them and insult them back. That’s one thing that makes absolutely no sense about insulting a wealthy Hollywood celebrity - they needn’t care at all what anyone has to say about them in a mean tweet. In the case of many (but not all) celebrities, all they would have to do is read the nasty tweet from an average citizen, turn up their nose by responding with a vulgar comment of their own (in many but not all cases) and then walk away with heads heisted high, not looking back (but certainly looking down). There’s actually a very good chance that many of these people (judging by most of their reactions) do not consider the opinions of nasty tweeters or even their own fans at all in most cases. The other end of this problem with intense celebrity worship is the fact that there are many celebrities who today (AS IN RIGHT NOW TIME) actually demand respect and constant adoration from fans no matter how badly they treat them, no matter how often they socially abuse their restaurant or hotel staff, no matter how often they insult people simply for not being famous or wealthy. True that there are many famous Hollywood legends who do not behave this way towards their fans or ordinary people in general, and are good and upstanding human beings of decent moral constitution. I’m not saying that every major film star or celebrity is a bad person by all means. Despite this there have been many ugly and nasty stories about Hollywood’s “most decorated citizens” over the years. Stories about celebrities (despite being paid, housed, clothed and fed better than most Americans have ever been throughout the history of the Republic - no joke here) spitting on fans, insulting their staff, acting as if they belong to a sort of “Super Class of Ellie Human Beings with Unmatchable Talents and Phenomenal Powers”, some even going so far as to abuse people who like them - insulting and abusing their fans of all people! I’m sorry to sound Marxist or preachy (trust me when I say that I do not intend to be either one of those things at all by saying this), but what I cannot understand is why so many people fee the need to bow and scrape before (not to mention take abuse from) these arrogant people who have money, connections and resources - things which their fans do not have. I realize that this sounds a bit Marxist, I assure you that’s not where I am coming from at the core. I never understood why people would chose to celebrate these people who would never ever chose to celebrate them, or even show them some basic kindness or appreciation for their applause. This is sometimes the case with Hollywood, but sadly not often the case in Tinseltown. The very term celebrity itself is derived from the term celebrate - I hate to say it but when you look around Hollywood today, unfortunately there is very little to celebrate. I don’t mean to be preachy, but let’s face it for what it’s really worth - Hollywood isn’t a neighborhood at all, it’s just a business that has been running itself into the ground over the past few decades with a steady decline in moral values, lack of empathy overtime (for others, especially fans and hired staff), and lastly a total disregard for social institutions that promote generosity and kindness. Hollywood in WW2 and Vietnam was engaged heavily in USO tours, troop fundraisers and had a long legacy of helping the less fortunate and those in America who needed help the most. Over the course of some 80 years we have gone from a young Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland promoting the first ever March of Dimes on behalf of President FDR, to modern millennial couples spitting on groups of cheering fans - why?! What every happened to values, and so many celebrities demand respect from people who they would openly shun, reject and refuse to know better? Mean tweets are (of course) wrong and hurtful - that coin has a very heavy flip side to it. There are a lot of celebrities that after reading the tweets respond in a much nastier way, and they often kick a few extra people on their way out the stage door.",5년 전,1,

@mg0dzillla17,"He might actually take it seriously and is wounded inside but laughs to cover it and to self soothe. He's claimed to have suffered depression and struggles with anxiety. I don't know much of that is true since so many people especially celebrities are coming out with this mental health issue or that disorder, as if its a trend or something cool to have, I don't know how to feel about that, personally dealing with OCD and anger management issues, also, ADHD. Its not good to have these issues neither do I mean its death for you and your life hereon after being diagnosed, I have dealt with them up to now and I am more or less in control and stabilised but the chances of relapse is there and I am currently going through a relapse and it's not funny or cool. Its a life sentence. You deal with these crap for life. But I am not saying you should be condemned or ashamed for having it. But glorifying them isn't exactly the way to go too. You don't judge or stigmatise but you don't want to also start sending the wrong message across to people by setting it as some kind of a trend. Raising awarenss for mental health the issues with it isn't about shaming or priding on them but understanding them and realizing you are no less or more but very much human like everyone else and you could still have a life and work to be where you want to be, so on and forth. Anyway point is, I have a friend who's got anxiety and she's good at hiding it. She plays it cool and laughs or it off everytime someone hurls abuse at or insults her or criticises her. Even when she gets told off or lectured she smiles and giggles like it's funny or she doesn't give a sh*t but truth is she's affected by it. I have seen it. One time she got told off at work and the next thing I know I went looking for her during our break, I found her alone at a corner, quite the distance away from our building, crying. Yeah. Goes to show, how individuals deal with their issues differently, even if its the same issue or definitely so if its a different one. Chris Evans reminds me of my friend.

@dhenderson1810," @shurooqelshaeir529  I can't stand the fandom of that show.   Once, people used to watch a TV show and boo the baddie.   Now, people cheer for evil characters like Walter White, and send death threats to the actress who played his wife, just because she tried to stop him in the show.   A wicked character like Walter White is cheered as a folk hero. I suppose you people admire real life drug dealers as well.   I just shows the moral fibre of the viewers that they think a character like Walter White is someone to be admired, and to aspire to, rather than hope that he gets what he has coming to him.   Is that a role model you want to aspire your children?   You can enjoy Bryan Cranston's performance, without liking Walter White.",3년 전,0,

@mac_mcleod,"@Mark Saguindel because he's one of the nicest guys in Hollywood both to his crews and to his customers and to random strangers.  And he's had an incredibly tragic real-life.  I think I would put the ranking at Mister Rogers then came to Keanu Reeves then Jimmy Carter then Jimmy Stewart and then maybe Jack Benny.  On top of that he's also really modest and sincerely shy when talk show host try to talk to him about his kind Deeds.  When asked about his acting, he always sincerely compliments his co-workers. And even minor staff on movies has said that he came up to them months later and addressed them by name.  He both shares his salary with some crews and he's given special gifts to other Crews.  But the one I like most is where he's being filmed on the subway. He doesn't know he's being filmed. Some people get on the subway and he gives his seat up for some random lady and stands holding the pole. And during that scene you can see he is constantly scanning and has incredible situational awareness too.  So I'd say hey Keanu Reeves, you a******, you make the rest of us look bad!  But actually he inspires me to be a better human being and I don't feel bad at all.",5년 전(수정됨),1,

@muskoharper2171,Good day! Are you looking to be well recognized on Instagram? I've been recently hoping to find a simple way to become renowned on the gram for a while now. I managed to build my company by using this straight forward strategy of obtaining followers. I started a wristwatch business a long time back and my hubby in essence departed the business because we were doing so poorly. I had tried out everything until I found this. It managed to get me to over 100k followers and as a consequence and now I'm selling 15-20 watches day by day and have a very lasting living. I additionally developed my personal account to over 50k followers and now my close friends envy me. It's fun to show it off to the fine young ladies that I meet at nyc pubs. I am going to allow you to do it too simply because you decided to take a look at my story. Just simply go to the webpage showing on this vid and then type your personal IG username. ➡️ _Just search this here on Youtube_: biginsta5000 (NO SPACES),7년 전,0,

@eyeceeu,Blue Bird You just answered your own question.,8년 전,1,
@bluebird5173,"The Slayinator   Are you saying they WANT to turn themselves off because they know they can never have a girl like Robbie in the first place?  Or are you saying they use the term because they're trying to sound ""nasty,"" like in a sexual way?   Because what I'm saying is that the term just sounds disgusting, and I don't mean that in a good way. I mean it sounds ""repulsive"" in the sense that it KILLS sexual arousal, or at least, reduces it.  I don't understand how it could do anything besides that.  When a guy is checking out a girl's ass, the LAST thing he's thinking is, ""that's the stinky area from which smelly gases are expelled.""  Yet, that's EXACTLY what the term ""fart box"" implies. It just doesn't make any sense how anyone could be turned on by such a term. It's so counterintuitive.  I CANNOT be the only one questioning this, struggling to understand it. I feel like a crazy person lost in sea of ordinary men (or perhaps I'm the last sane person left, and everyone around me has gone crazy).",8년 전,1,
@eyeceeu,"Blue Bird I can't really explain it to you because it's more a sense of humor thing, but I'll try. When someone says ""fart box"" they're being sarcastic about having sex.   It's like when a 90 year old man tells everyone that ""he's still getting all the hot women.""  He's being sarcastic and joking about sex.  It's like when someone draws some eyelashes and lipstick on a dead fish and says ""Well I'll bang this instead of Beyonce any day!""  They're not trying to turn themselves off. They're just saying something that they think is funny.",8년 전(수정됨),3,

(that has become a fascination nowadays, no matter how they just want to be remembered).  Just for reference, the compliment he likely started with was that she was good looking.  I also said that whether it's insulting to her is up to her. It's fairly clear it would have been insulting to you.

And, there's no 'undoing' after the fact when the exploits are public record and the rewards high as sky (i.e. she made her bed, let them record her in it, and got massive pay checks for it).

Women are way more harassed and assaulted than men. White men should be happy that they don't need to protest for basic human rights. If men suffered the same amount of sexism as women (which I'm happy they don't) I would be just as upset, but right now, women are the ones who need people to stand up for them.

Also again just cause someone people like eating someone's ass out that's on them some eat out a woman's vagina and some people won't since they find it gross. It's whatever people like in sex since it's always good to experiment with having sex since no one wants the same old things to do in the bed room but you clearly won't know that. ,9년 전,0,

ASK HIM TO FORGIVE YOUR SINS    STOP PUTTING YOUR HOPE IN THE GOVERNMENT, IN RELIGION, IN SCIENCE, IN  WEALTH, IN CELEBS, IN SPORTS, IN THE WORLD (IT WILL PERISH!)  YOU CAN STAND ON YOUR OWN AGAINST GOD AND TRY TO JUSTIFY YOUR SIN WHEN  YOU WONT EVEN BE ABLE TO LOOK UP YOU WILL BE WEEPING IN TERROR REALIZING YOU  MADE A BIG MISTAKE.  YOU WONT WIN AN ARGUMENT WITH GOD, HE CREATED  EVERYTHING!!!  GOD SEES EVERYTHING YOUVE EVER DONE; YOU WONT FOOL HIM!!!  OR   PUT YOUR TRUST IN JESUS WHO DIED ON THE CROSS AND TOOK THE WRATH OF GOD IN  OUR PLACE FOR OUR SINS.  IT'S A FREE GIFT BUT HE CANT FORCE YOU TO TAKE  IT.  WILL YOU CALL UPON HIM NOW AND SURRENDER TO HIM.  TALK TO HIM LIKE  ABEST FRIEND, HE'S WAITING AND HE LOVES YOU.   Turn back to God  Our Creator, not religion.  Religion creates bondage, in Christ there is  freedom.  Im not talking church, im not talking religion, im talking  relationship with your Creator.  Call upon Jesus now and ask Him into  your life and to forgive your sins.   hell is the absence of God Almighty who gives us the breath in our lungs, water, food, sunshine,  love, kindness, patience, faithfulness, hope, rest, help etc.  hell is real and its a place of torment: you will have to live with all your mistakes, regrets, you will feel all  the pain you caused others...  you be hungry but not be able to eat you will be thirsty but wont be able to drink you will be tired but cant sleep you will have no hope you will have no rest you will feel pure hatred towards you (satan and the fallen  angels/demons hate you and want to drag you to hell)  “For the wages of sin is death (hell), but the gift of God is eternal  life in Christ Jesus our Lord” -Romans 6:23 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life.
