@the_Real_Grammy_of_6,"@nopeno-s5r I’m glad that you’re comfortable with that, seriously I’m not being sarcastic. And you are probably right about the lap bars.,,,,,,NOW. But I had a very frightening experience when I was 13 years old in 1978. I was on the fastest & tallest roller coaster (wooden) in the world - at the time. Colossus at Magic Mountain (now 6 flags Magic Mountain). I fit all of the requirements to ride. Yes it was extremely tall - I’m still not sure if I left my stomach on the ride 😉. And it was fast, which I loved, until the first turn, going around 63 miles an hour, and I came out of my seat. I had experienced “air time”/negative G force many times before but it happened with every turn. I was terrified that I was going to be thrown out of my seat. I was trying to hold on as tight as I possibly could in case I actually came out. (I know but I was only 13 😩)  2 weeks after my experience, a woman was thrown out of her seat and obviously killed while riding Colossus. They claimed it was because of her “size”. I didn’t buy it then and I buy it now. If she was too big, then why was she allowed on a brand new, still in the news because of it being the tallest and fastest roller coaster in the world? I know what I felt and I was not big. My lap bar was locked. I always changed the safety locks twice on every ride I rode. It made me afraid to go on any roller coaster after that experience. Although I didn’t realize that until years later. Anyway if I would ever want to go on another roller coaster, I would only go if they had shoulder harnesses 🥹🥹. But I’m old now and I’m happy to ride It’s a Small World (if I was able to sell a kidney to pay for a ticket 😠)! But thats a whole other story and it’s not a positive one for The Disney company 😡 PS I forgot about you mentioning comfort. I am more interested in living than comfort for a couple of minutes ride 😁",2개월 전(수정됨),0,
@nopeno-s5r," @the_Real_Grammy_of_6  Fair enough. Fear of roller coasters is fairly common, I think it's helpful to remember that most accidents are caused by rider error (and park error as they should not let that person ride)",2개월 전,0,

That roller coaster was Colossus at Six Flags Magic Mountain during the last rides event. His friends were recording it and they were messing with him. On the lift hill they told him “oh look! A bolt just came loose…” His reaction was exactly like Kevin’s… he kept saying “quit playin’ quit playin’ all the way up the lift hill and he looked absolutely terrified on the way down that first drop! It’s a good thing his friends didn’t take him on Goliath for his first ride. The reaction was priceless.,1년 전,1,

@jamesfiaco4922,I am always thinking of ways to enhance that fun so the experience becomes physically mentally financially spiritually beneficial and rewarding. Example the roller coasters should include some kind of test to see how well a person may keep their composure under high intensity excitement. Like being able to write your name and address before the ride ends. I think would be a fun way to test one's eye hand coordination similar to astronauts and jet fighters. Equally as true all roller coasters today should automatically have an electronic system that is constantly scanning the track for weakness fractures rust and corrosion. And with today's technologies should be no problem to upgrade any and all other roller coasters which will maximize on safety so people may have extreme fun on every ride.,2년 전,0,

@kevinorro1," @bigliambig  The mummy was one of the best rides in universal. Lots of great air time and the theming is on point. It is definitely one of the mildest coasters at universal. Dueling dragons was probably one of the smoothest rides until they redid hulk. Hulk is ridiculously smooth now and I highly recommend it although the line is always stupidly long. Pro tips: Always head to the back of the park first and do the popular rides at lunchtime when everyone is eating. Also hit the back of the park again near closing for almost no wait since everyone will be working their way back to the front of the park to leave. And if you don't like bumpy rides never sit in the very back, you may think it's the calmest part but if you know physics you know that you'll get the most side to side action; however, you 100% get the greatest airtime in the back since the front has already accelerated in the drop so you essentially get whipped through the end of the lift into the drop. If you want even more airtime scoot your butt forward on the seat and press your back to the seat, that way it looks like your sitting all the way back but you are actually leaving a gap after the strap you in so you can literally lift up out of your seat on airtime hills and drops. And for people scared of going upside down, as I was when I first started riding coasters, look forward because it's harder to tell you're upside down since all you see is track in front of you, plus the rolls are over in about a second anyways.",2년 전,0,

@GospelMessenger1,"The gospel by which we're SAVED. We're under Paul's ministry today. Therefore we're not under the law of the old testament. 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 (KJV)(1) Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the GOSPEL (good news) which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; (2) By which also ye are SAVED, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain (self). (3) For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that CHRIST DIED for our SINS according to the scriptures; (4) And that he was BURIED, and that he ROSE AGAIN the THIRD DAY according to the scriptures.  And that takes us back to John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH in him should NOT PERISH, but have EVERLASTING LIFE. Ephesians 2:8-9 (KJV) (8) For by GRACE are ye SAVED through FAITH; and that NOT of yourselves: it is the GIFT of GOD: (9) NOT of works, lest any man should boast. So it's only by GRACE that we are SAVED not by works. JESUS did all the work and gave us GRACE (unmerited favor) as long as we have FAITH (believe) in the DEATH, BURIAL, and RESURRECTION of Jesus Christ for SALVATION (trust in his BLOOD ATONEMENT). That's the gospel. JESUS said, Ye must be BORN AGAIN to enter into the kingdom.(accept Jesus as your SAVIOUR)   READ, UNDERSTAND, BELIEVE (from the heart by FAITH) and be SAVED",4년 전,0,

@emilysarah8557,"Good Day everyone,  I actually want to use this medium to thank Dr okafor ( okaforspelltemple@gmail.com ) for his great deeds upon my life ad family, I was married for over 6 years, after these years things started getting ugly and we had fights and arguments almost all the time, it got worse at a point that he filed for a divorce. I tried my best to make him change his mind & stay with me. But he moved out of the house and still went ahead to file for the divorce. I pleaded and tried everything but still nothing worked. The breakthrough came when a friend introduced me to this wonderful, great spell caster Named Dr okafor ( okaforspelltemple@gmail.com ) who eventually helped me out. I have never been a fan or believe in things like this but just decided to give a try because i was desperate and left with no choice. He did special prayers and used roots and herbs. Within 24 hours my Husband who left me called me and was sorry for all the emotional trauma he had cost me, he moved back to the house and we continue to live happily again. what a wonderful miracle Dr okafor ( okaforspelltemple@gmail.com ) did for me and my family. I have introduced him to a lot of couples who has same problems across the world and they have had good news. I strongly believe someone out there need's his help as well. Do write to him on email or simply text him on Whatsapp: +2348108058139  Do make extra effort to save your marriage/relationship, you can also contact him if you have any of the below problems....",4년 전,0,

BUT the scary thing is here they stop to let them on but for regular people the loading track actually slowly keeps moving as you’re getting on. So you actually have no time to think about what you’re doing which can make it a bit stressful. . You just gotta Sit down, get locked in and go! I hate the belly drop feeling of coasters like this but I can truly tell you that if you work your way up to this one and BREATHE it’s not that bad. Do it!",5년 전(수정됨),0,

THE RUSH OF BEING ON A ROLLERCOASTER was crazy, i even had my hands up... i realised i get scared(in a funway) of minor rollercoasters compared to the big ones.. the big rollercoasters go so fast, your body doesnt even get the chance to know whats even going on, you just feel this chemical rush!!

We seemed to be going so fast, I couldn't stop laughing and crying at the same time! Soooo funny! We also went on that Splash Mt. ride and she insisted she sit in the front of the log! I sat behind her! And I guess she forgot it went down a huge hill into water? Anyway we shot down the hill at about 100mph, and hit that water hard! And this tidal wave crashed all over her! A face full of water tidal wave! I crunched down in a ball behind her, and somehow did not get that wet! They take your picture on that ride, and she had this funny look on her face! She looked like someone had thrown her into a pool! We both were laughing so hard we were crying...at least I was!!! So funny!

Sharp turns, drops and climbs...all going fast...which should have been awesome.  Just keep your head plastered to the back of the seat, right?  WRONG.  There is no real padding for your head & neck and the back of the seat is HARD PLASTIC (you can plainly see that in the video)...and the ride is BUMPY AS HELL!  So your choice is to either get the back of your head beat in ~100 times on the 90 second ride or risk a neck injury.  I'm getting irritated just thinking about it!",5년 전,0,

@jktwiceft,"“Home of the greatest coasters in the world.”  Well...  Rip Ride Rockit  is okay. Can anyone say, “brake runs”? Those X-Cars lock you in tight and there’s no point in actually having those restraints. The point I think was to allow for more airtime and inversions without OTSR.  Hulk is pretty damn good after the retracking, but maybe it will develop a rattle again? Best coaster in the Resort.  Revenge of the Mummy isn’t thrilling, but theming is on point. Thank you Premier.  Dueling Dragons is gone, but it was dead the moment they stopped dueling. After that it was just two average inverts. That new Intamin Blitz going in looks really promising so far.  Flight of the Hippogriff is a family coaster. What else do I have to say?  So yeah, not a whole lot of coasters, but that’s not really the point of Universal. I’ll still ride Hulk over and over again though. Single Rider barely has a wait.",7년 전,0,

@xXSilverstream,"This is absolutely hilarious, however I couldn't fully enjoy it as I have a bad experience with this ride; in 2010 my family and some family friends went to Florida, this ride was brand spanking new, I went on it with my dad and two friends and it done so you had to get in it and strapped down while it was moving and my harness/bar didn't lock down properly so me and my dad were screaming to get it to stop, it did, they sorted out my bar but then the whole way around I was so scared it was going to unlock. Earlier this year I was back in Florida for another holiday, and I steered clear of it. No way was I going back on it. Currently it is the only ride I refuse to go on. Absolutely anything else I will at least try once. I love roller coasters and I refuse to let one bad experience deter me.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

Actually, Universal is like heaven and cloud nine combined! It was fucking awesome. I also went on the Hulk Coaster. I'd say my favorite ride was The Forbidden Journey at Hogwarts. By the way, if you're planning to go there, you REALLY NEED TO GET THE FUCKING EXPRESS PASS! If it weren't for the express pass at Universal, I would have spent most of my day waiting in line. Anyways, Universal was awesome! Just don't go to Volcano Bay. It's a good waterpark, but it has a bunch of dumb rules and no express pass line.

So I would be glad if some of you would come around to watch some them. :)  From now on I plan to upload a video 2 or 3 times a month. Besides to the current formats like NoLimits 2 and impressions of amusement parks and fairgrounds, I will produce new formats e.g. amusement park soundtracks on piano and time lapses of NoLimits 2. Now I hope, that I have convinced you to come around to my channel and I would be glad to read some positive and constructive comments. :) Otherwise I wish you a lot of fun in the comment section.

You go straight up for like 30-50 seconds then you gonna like pretty much straight down!!! Then you go super fast and it's sooo fun!!! I went on it four times in a row with my 15 year old brother!!!!

@kleverklogs,"RaNtingishealthy It depends on what you find scary, you feel the speed more when you're at the back due to higher g's, however at the front you go over the drops first and have less time to prepare yourself for what's coming.

I'm not as well versed with physics as you are !  what I'm saying is simply that the mind is the most powerful proponent of  deception ..   and the mind will always feel the fear most when in front on the roller coaster.... when you are at the back, even if its got more g force , the mind is simply comforted by the fact that there are others in front   Im sorry if I havent explained well..",8년 전,1,

@tohdohsibir,"It's actually better to sit in the front. You get the most whiplash and freefall in the back. (Arenaline junkies know this, and for that reason love it in the back.) People who don't like a lot of freefall, however, make the mistake of sitting back when they're likely better off at the front. I'm one of those who like rides for the speed, not so much the height and freefall. I like the front because I'd rather see where I'm going and how far I'm from the ground. I also keep my eyes open, because falls seem longer and worse with my eyes shut. And, for some reason, letting my hands out at the falls feels better than clamming up and gripping the safety bars. Funny, I find that everything to make a ride more enjoyable than scary completely goes against what scared people would think to do. So sit in the front, loosen up, relax, and open your eyes. :) I wish I could tell all this to poor Kevin, and he would've had a better time.",8년 전(수정됨),37,

I can't wait to go back to Cedar Point and ride their new Valravn dive coaster. Which will be the tallest and fastest dive coaster in the world. I know that there are other parks that can possibly contend with Cedar Point but this is just my opinion and I do not mean to make any shameless advertising or toll anybody.

@ubtoo05,"Roller coasters have always just frightened me since child myself and really don't like slightest bit.  I've been on a few though that were considered very scary and about 20 or so,  so I've done that.  They just keep getting more intense and scarier now days so I am done haha. I hate when with a group though and most keep pressuring you and sometimes a few in the group won't even ride it... a×× holes. I've done ones I care to and done with it... everyone else can enjoy for all I care.  I think hearing about cage one in California that came off track and landed in water and about 7 or so people died from made me not like so much.  I repeat,  you all enjoy 🙌😨.",10년 전,0,

So this was the first ride I went on to conquer my fear, but I kept my eyes closed almost the whole time. Everyone was screaming except me. I kept on saying, ""I did not think this through"" over and over again. Now that I see what I did, I feel even more terrified, but content with myself all at once.

@pencilstreak9,"Skyler Powers If you don't feel like you have a good chance of dying, it's not a good roller coaster.   Kingda Ka is modern. You know that a roller coaster built specifically to break a world record is going to be tested again, and again, and again. El Toro may be a former record breaker, but it sure isn't modern. When you're standing in line, you can here the supports making an unholy shrieking. Hell, sometimes if the wind is strong you can swear that they sway a little. Not to mention that all that's keeping you in the ride is a leg support and a tiny little metal bar that you hold onto; there isn't any upper body restraint whatsoever.   It definitely is the superior ride. ",10년 전,0,
@skylerpowers8871,"Stocking Anarchy Um Kingda Ka opened in 2005 and El Toro opened in 2006 which means Kingda Ka is older than El Toro.  Just sayin'.  And I don't feel like I'm going to die on El Toro or any coaster but I prefer El Toro because it has amazing airtime and those 90 degree banked turns are super fun.  And also, lap bars are super safe.  In fact, Top Thrill Dragster, a coaster at Cedar Point a lot like Kingda Ka just has lap bars.  And a lot of large coasters have lap bars like El Toro, Millennium Force, Fury 325, Bizarro and countless others.  Also, ALL roller coaster supports sway.  You need that give or else the tension from the trains' force would be too great and deteriorate the structure.  A roller coaster without swaying supports would not last long.  It's sort of like how tall skyscrapers are made to sway in the wind.  That being said, El Toro is better due to its length, airtime, and turns.  Kingda Ka is fantastic.  It is an adrenaline rush.  But it is over so fast and the launch is kind of shaky.  But I just thought I'd say that El Toro is one of the most modern coasters out there.  It is wooden yet it is really smooth, tall, fast. long, and steep. ",10년 전,1,

@goon303,"Sorry, made a couple of mistakes in my last post. The park is called ""Fuji Q Highland"". I went there like 7 years ago so... And Dodompa is or was the record holder for fastest acceleration. The start is extremely fast. There are some videos of the coasters on Youtube. My height information was correct but the actual height from the ground at the highest point is 79m. The bottom is 9m off the ground, so the first drop is 70m.",10년 전,0,
@goon303,"For you guys talking about the biggest roller coasters etc. You should check out Fujiyama Park in Japan. The ""Fujiyama"" roller coaster in Japan is a Guinness book of world records holder for being  the largest rolled coaster in the world. The first plunge is 70 meters high at a 65 degree angle and reaches a speed of 145 km/h at the bottom... Not sure if it still holds the record or not...  At the same park they have another Guinness book of world records holder called ""Dodompa"". Not sure about the spelling... It holds the record for the fastest roller coaster in the world. I don't know what the top speed is though. It was closed for maintenace for most of the day when I was there. I got to see it running though and it was pretty fast....  Both coasters have huge Guinness plaques next to their respective entrances... So I think the records are legit.  The park is close to Mt. Fuji so it also has a pretty amazing view.  ",10년 전,0,

(Insert sex joke here) Also it's usually the ride requiring the most tickets as well. Other than that they are a blast to ride when you have a day pass and if it's not to busy you can usually get 3 or 4 rides in a row depending where you are :),10년 전,1,

@Sunsetter678,"That was FUNNY! But I remember being on the Texas Cyclone at Six Flags Houston,Tx. We were in the first seat, and all was good until.....We got to the crest of the 1st drop, sat there for like 15 minutes, then the damn thing rolled BACKWARDS all the way back through the boarding area. We stopped (Wish I was kidding!!!!) for like a nano second, and they didn't even check on us, they just shipped up through again! Luckily all was good the 2nd time, but I stayed away from that ride for a WHILE after that. And this was  way before you started to really hear about carnival, and theme park ride accidents, and mechanical failures. In fact the very last roller coaster I rode was the Silver Bullet out on Kemah Boardwalk,Tx. My Husband and I foolishly chose to ride together. Problem w/that? I had not lost my 80 lbs yet, and we both had on thick coats for the weather. This is an ALL wood coaster. At the time I believe I was 30....Something, and after the ride from HELL way through, we both said NO MORE! So IF we ever ride another one, it's gonna be steel baby! You FEEL everything on a wooden coaster, and it is NOT for people w/existing major injuries, or are easily injured. But if you're young, and crazy...Or old and crazy, give em both a shot. But for me and my Man, it's nothing but steel coasters for us!",10년 전,0,

@meganhale6164,"Some coasters are made to roll backwards like that, it's a safety mechanism. When it rolls back like that it's because the car didn't pick up enough speed. Also, when you ride ANY coaster there is a large sign which tells potential riders NOT to ride if they have existing injuries, back problems, etc. Steel coasters aren't going to be any better than a wooden coaster if you have all these ailments and injury easily. Whether the frame is made of wood or steel, the rider will still be flung around regardless. Maybe you're just tooo old to ride any coaster. ",10년 전,1,

Not when Cedar Point, Six Flags Magic Mountain, and Six Flags Great Adventure have larger collections and coasters that are actual Top 10. In fact, most years since 2000, No 1 and No 2 in the world have alternated between Millennium Force at Cedar Point and Bizarro (aka Superman Ride of Steel) at Six Flags New England). Busch Gardens in Tampa actually has a better collection of coasters and most rate higher than Universal's Orlando coasters.

It feels like a long, but fast discomfort you have to deal with in the whole 4 or so minutes you're on this ride. Forget choosing your favorite song to ride the coaster with to make riding it a little more pleasing; I chose a Daft Punk song riding it and it still felt discomforting.  I dunno if it's because I don't necessarily like coasters where you feel the ""coming out the seat"" G-force like that ride, Sheikra, and Cheetah Hunt (which I rode twice to wonder if it was where it was only because it was my first time riding it) but yeah.

If you want the greatest, there are only 2 parks in the country to go to. One is Magic Mountain in L.A. The other is Cedar Point in Ohio. Those parks have record breakers and unique coasters all over the place.

@purplepandasrock43,"As someone who has rode the rocket more times than I can count, I can tell you that the first time riding it scared the living crap out of me am so was in front row. The bar that goes around your waist probably is about 50 pounds and you have little to none breathing room, it's very uncomfortable. The drop for the first time is basically like jumping off a building, because you are going straight down for the first part and even with the bar you fly up out of your chair. I understand why they're scared, I was ready to cry when I rode it for the first time. Some people just don't handle risky things like that as well as others. I will confirm that's my favorite ride, it beats the Hulk and all the Harry Potter Roller coasters. It's probably the best attraction in the park.",10년 전,0,

He is part of the SOLUTION instead of part of the problem. Maybe I'm a little biased.... but I say ""Short People Rok!"" If I were his mom, I would be so proud of him. I only hope the young people in my life, both tall and short, would pursue until they are half the man Kevin Hart is.   RitaAnn~ ...thankful this man has brought so much joy and laughter to this little short woman. http://godshomies.wordpress.com/mom-of-many-meet-my-kids/",11년 전,0,

@QueenLioness84,"Swing Your Sinners Of course, I did. I, also did a Google search to curb my confusion. However, as it turns out, Disney has built about 3 of these coasters. They all seem to be different, but under the same name. There is one in Paris, France, Florida and California. The Rock n' Roller coaster in Orlando is indoors, in almost complete darkness and features Aerosmith music throughout the entire ride.  Clearly, this isn't the same coaster even thought Jimmy stated it was in Orlando resort or either my research gave me wrong information. Since there are many different ones and I'm not, intimately, familiar with each location. I was hoping a more knowledgeable poster would respond, instead of some smart ass asking me the obvious questions.",11년 전,0,
