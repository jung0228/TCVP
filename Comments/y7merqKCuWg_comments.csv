He sent me this song, and I remember crying while listening to it. We were both crying. Kev, if you ever come across this, I want to let you know that even years later, I'm still deeply in love with you and I haven't stopped thinking about you every single day.

@laeequenadvi4746,"EXPANDING UNIVERSE.MENTIONED  IN HOLY QUR'AN  1500 YEARS AGO   ALMIGHTY ALLAH THE ORIGINATOR TO THE UNIVERSE AND CREATOR OF THE MANKIND  Who can claim 1350 years ago that the universe is expending?          والسماء بنينها بايد و انا لموسعون o    "" And the heaven We built it with power, and indeed, We are the expander ""       (And We it is Who make the vast extent, thereof )                              (Qur'an, 51:47)   Until 1931, physicist Albert Einstein believed that the universe was static. An urban legend attributes this change of perspective to when American astronomer Edwin Hubble showed Einstein his observations of redshift in the light emitted by far away nebulae – today known as galaxies. After Hubble discovered that the universe was expanding, Einstein called the cosmological constant his ""greatest blunder.""   At around the same time, larger telescopes were being built that were able to accurately measure the spectra, or the intensity of light as a function of wavelength, of faint objects. Almighty Allah is the Creator of the whole universe.He says:  Should He not know what He created? And He is the Subtile, the Aware.  The knowledge of scientists is very limited and insufficient to understand the universe! ! Recently NASA launched JWST. This telescope will see the beginning of the universe and how it evolved. Today the scientists accepted that they know very little about the universe.   DR.MOHAMMAD LAEEQUE NADVI  Ph.D. (Arabic Lit.) M.A. Arabic Lit.

@laeequenadvi4746,"WHO IS ALMIGHTY ALLAH   ALLAH  PROTECTS HUMANS ON EARTH FROM ATOMIC CHARGED SOLAR FLARES/ SOLAR STORMS   WHAT IF THERE IS NO PROTECTIVE SHIELD  Almighty Allah says:   خالق کائنات قرآن میں ارشاد فرمائتا ہے :   "" و جعلنا السماء سقفا محفوظا و هم عن   آياتها  معرضون  "" "" And We have made the sky as a roof withheld (from them),Yet they turn from its portents.                            (Qur'an,21:32) This verse indicates that our life on Earth is  protected  from solar rediations  and atomic charged solar storms , meteors and other cosmic attacks, pose a threat to living things on Earth.  Asteroids and meteorites have penetrated the atmosphere and hit the earth throughout the course of history.  First of all let us make it clear that the word  ""  السماء"" (Sama) is  used in the above verse which is singular means the universe known to the scientists in modern cosmology.  Space researches explains that the      "" سقفا محفوظا""  (protecting roof)       has very vast meaning which means  all magnetic fields discoverd in space from original magnetic field to  the Earth's magnatic field, to atmospheric layers around the earth. 1. Troposphere 2. Stratosphere 3. Ozone 4. Mesosphere  5. Thermosphere 6. Ionosphere 7. Exosphere  Functions of  these layere are to protect Earth from :  1. If these layers have not been existed, life could not be possible on earth.They protect life by providing weathers. Moreover most of Oxygen occurs in this region is responsible for the life of Aerobic organisms.  2. Ozone layer absorbs Ultra Voilet Radiations and thus protects life from hazardous radiations of the Sun. Moreover it provides ""Green House Effect"" which is responsible for maintaining comfortable temperature on Earth.  3. Mesosphere burns up million of meteors striking the Earth and thus protects the life from these meteors.   4. Exosphere absorbs harmful radiations from the sun protecting layers underneath.  Above discussion makes it clear that"" السما"" (sky)in the above verse  means the universe.It means that Almighty Allah has protected our life on earth form all kind of threats and attacks from space by this mechanism. These magnetic fields  have covered the universe including the earth like an umbrella.  We could not understand the actual meaning of "" سقفا محفوظا ""    untill the  modern cosmology discovered these magnetic fields with the help of modern radio telescope.   In beginning of seventh century who can tell us with no telescope that human life is well protected by this "" سقفا محفوظا "" .  Almighty Allah is    بديع السموات والأرض إذا قضى أمرا فإنما يقول له كن فيكون o      ( البقرة : ١١٧)   The Originator of the heavens and the earth! When He decreeth a thing, He saith unto it only:Be! and it is.   Some scientists like Stephen Hawking claimed that there is no creator and this universe doesn't need any creator. Such false claims can't justified in the light of signs described in Holy Qur'an as evidences that there is a creator. This universe infront of us speaks about Almighty Allah. Nature and science speak about a creator -- Almighty Allah.    DR.MOHAMMAD LAEEQUE NADVI  Ph.D. (Arabic Lit.)

@laeequenadvi4746,"Mike Hunt   Particles Physics in Holy Qur'an   The word "" ذرة "" used in this verse  means atom. Smaller than atom indicate that there are particles smaller than atom. Atom is not the smallest particle. Atom contains  neutron, electron and proton. The latest researches of atoms tells that the world of  atoms is very strangeful and astonishing.  Almighty Allah says:   و قال الذين كفروا لاتأتينا الساعة ، قل بلى وربى لتاتينكم علم الغيب لا يعزب عنه مثقال ذرة في السموات ولا في الأرض و لا اصغر من ذلك ولا أكبر إلا في كتب مبين  o  "" Those who disbelieve say: The Hour will never come unto us. Say: Nay,  by my Lord, but it is coming unto you surely. (He is) the knower of the Unseen. Not an itom's weight, or less than that or greater, escapeth Him in the heavens or in the earth, but it is in a clear Record"".  If yon see meaning of atom in Arabic dictionaries you will come to know that atom means ذرة and particles.  Who can tell us about 1500 years ago that there are a strangeful world called the world of Quantum.   You don't know Arabic. Learn and study more. It is better and in your interests to believe in Almighty Allah and worship Him only and believe that prophet Muhammad is His last and final messenger.    Only Almighty Allah can tell us with no telescope or any astro-physical analysis such minute things.He knows everything because He is the Creator of everything in the world.

@GlassOfWater87,"@Lewis Webber you mentioned: ; 'If you were really  in love and happy you'd have treated her right'. That's a risky thing to say without knowing what was going on, although I understand the thought process. I loved her dearly but there was something that I , apparently, loved more. And that thing ruined everything. learning from the mistake is the best thing you can do because it, hopefully,  prevents repetition. Or at least, that's what we hope. I will try the best I can to make myself happy and learn from the past. It's the best thing we can do, right? Doesn't mean that we can feel like shit about our past though.   It's crazy to think how much influence certain decisions have on our lives. In an ideal world I was still with her, but apparently I needed this lesson. I wont ever repeat my behavior with the next girl, that's what I know for certain. I wish you the best bb. Until the day we meet again...hopefully..<3",4년 전(수정됨),1,

When I found out he was moving overseas I knew I would no longer experience the pure ecstasy of performing the perfect ruck followed by a pop play and embracing midfield to celebrate our success while ignoring all others. I hear this song and reminisce, I can still  hear our opponents shouting ""he is dummy half he can't score"" followed by the ref declaring ""no he's not"", if I close my eyes and simply listen to James blunts lyrics here. I will forever cherish those moments where we would retire to the clubhouse to tell tales of our conquest as all those who were lucky enough to be seated nearby listened in to catch a glimpse of perfection.

And this song sends emotions through me like no song ever has. 90% of the words relate to me and my former partner. And this live version is the best one. If only I could turn back time and change the things that went wrong and made her fall out of love with me but that’s not possible. So I’ll live forever more knowing it could have been, should have been and possibly wouldn’t have been different but wasn’t because of me. The price you pay.",4년 전,11,

I wasn't really a fan but I love live music so decided to go with my friend. We're both 30+ blokes... truly, James was absolutely fantastic. One of the best live concerts I have ever been to, better than Queen + AL in my opinion, and I've seen them 17 times now.",4년 전,2,

I'd spend a lifetime with you.  I know your fears and you know mine. We've had our doubts but now we're fine. And I love you, I swear that's true. I cannot live without you.  [2x] Goodbye, my lover. Goodbye, my friend. You have been the one. You have been the one for me.  And I still hold your hand in mine, In mine when I'm asleep.

@VirtualRealia,James Blunt is easily the most talented male writer/singer. He writes and sings the feelings most guys have trouble articulating. All of us are like “yep- he gets it”. The moment he sings “I’m so hollow...” We all agree. This is a definitely a heartfelt performance and a tough one to sing. What a talent.,5년 전,1,

Some of them are staring out in the emptiness or looking down. Some maybe are just listening and enjoying the song, but I think many of them are reminiscing and thinking about their own experiences. Letting each and single word truly resonate with them and take them somewhere. Just as it does to me when I'm listening to this. I think that is one of the most true beauties about music.

He shares it with you, you have no choice but to feel what’s coursing through him.   It’s not the song it’s him sharing his core without fear, placing it out there, raw for everyone to see.

@ExploreWithEthan,This song hurts me the most as I’m 16 now and it reminds me of my extremely kind stepmom who parted with my dad when I was about 11 who was like a second mum to me. I remember once this song came on in the car when we were on the way to wales and i instantly looked in the passenger seat (no one there)I broke down quietly in the backseat. It’s hard for me to write this without crying but this song isn’t halve touching in every way. I grew up up with my stepmom so it’s very hard you know.,5년 전,19,

That doesn't nearly suggest I don't think that this isn't one of the most mesmerising performances I've ever seen. If you're going to write a song that means something to you, this right here is a model example of how to perform it. It's phenomenal. If you think of a relative comparison, Elton John's Your Song. Instrumentally exactly the same, and lyrically Goodbye My Lover is arguably far better. James Blunt's performance is a country mile better than Elton John's original version of Your Song.

Mógłbym spędzić z Tobą całe życie. Znam Twoje lęki, a Ty znasz moje. Mieliśmy wątpliwości, ale teraz jest dobrze I kocham Cię, przysięgam, że to prawda. Nie potrafię bez Ciebie żyć.  Żegnaj, moja ukochana. Żegnaj, moja przyjaciółko. Byłaś tą jedyną. Byłaś tą jedyną dla mnie.  I wciąż trzymam Twoją dłoń w mojej. Kiedy śpię.

'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun, Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won. So I took what's mine by eternal right. Took your soul out into the night. It may be over but it won't stop there, I am here for you if you'd only care. You touched my heart you touched my soul. You changed my life and all my goals. And love is blind and that I knew when, My heart was blinded by you. I've touched your lips and held your hand. Shared your dreams and shared your bed. I know you well, I know your smell. I've been addicted to you.  Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. You have been the one. You have been the one for me. (2x)  I am a dreamer and when I wake, You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take. And as you move on, remember me, Remember us and all we used to be I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile. I've watched you sleeping for a while. I'd be the father of your child. I'd spend a lifetime with you. I know your fears and you know mine. We've had our doubts but now we're fine, And I love you, I swear that's true. I cannot live without you.  Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. You have been the one. You have been the one for me. (2x)  And I still hold your hand in mine. In mine when I'm asleep. And I will bare my soul in time, When I'm kneeling at your feet.  Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. You have been the one. You have been the one for me. (2x)  I’m so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow. I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow. I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow. I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

When he appeared on the UK show Songbook, Blunt explained: ""I guess it's a realization that you'll never be with someone, but the frustration that they are still alive and out there in the world. It can be an incredibly painful idea - I sat with the song for quite a long time. But for me, it's probably my most personal song.

You changed my life and all my goals. And love is blind and that I knew when, My heart was blinded by you.  I've kissed your lips and held your head. Shared your dreams and shared your bed. I know you well, I know your smell. I've been addicted to you.  Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. You have been the one. You have been the one for me.  I am a dreamer but when I wake, You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take. And as you move on, remember me, Remember us and all we used to be  I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile. I've watched you sleeping for a while. I'd be the father of your child. I'd spend a lifetime with you.  I know your fears and you know mine. We've had our doubts but now we're fine, And I love you, I swear that's true. I cannot live without you.  Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. You have been the one. You have been the one for me.  And I still hold your hand in mine. In mine when I'm asleep. And I will bear my soul in time, When I'm kneeling at your feet.  Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. You have been the one.

@janetp8669,"SONG FACTS: https://www.songfacts.com/facts/james-blunt/goodbye-my-lover  This song is about a girl Blunt dated, but he wrote it years after the relationship ended. When he appeared on the UK show Songbook, Blunt explained: ""I guess it's a realization that you'll never be with someone, but the frustration that they are still alive and out there in the world. It can be an incredibly painful idea - I sat with the song for quite a long time. But for me, it's probably my most personal song. Whereas 'You're Beautiful' is about a moment, one second in time of passing that person, the song 'Goodbye My Lover' is about a lifetime's worth of emotion, the fact that that relationship is over, and that life continues. And yeah, it's the most personal song on Back To Bedlam."" James Blunt lived with actress Carrie Fisher while he recorded Back To Bedlam; he met her through a family friend. In the Radio Times February 10, 2006, James Blunt described how he recorded this song in Carrie Fisher's bathroom: ""For 'Goodbye My Lover,' we needed a piano. There wasn't one in the home studio we recorded in but Carrie had one in her bathroom. So I said, Let's get the home studio and spend the night in there. It was a good acoustic - that's why people sing in the shower. And it sounds great to me - that's what's on the album."" If you think the person Blunt is singing about in this song is dead, you're not the only one; Blunt says he gets asked that a lot. He says the girl he's singing about is very much alive, but the grieving in the song gives the impression of death. This was the fourth single from Back to Bedlam, and in the UK it caused a bit of Blunt-fatigue. In May 2006, the UK radio station Essex FM banned this and all of Blunt's other songs because ""We appreciate his success but we need a break."" A 2006 UK survey by The Bereavement Register revealed this to be the year's most requested funeral song. Carrie Fisher was the reason for naming the album Back to Bedlam. ""Fisher was my American mother, and a real inspiration,"" Blunt explained to The London Times. ""My first album was called Back to Bedlam because I lived in a madhouse with her. She put a cardboard cutout of herself as Leia outside my room, with her date of birth and date of death on her forehead. I'm trying to remember what the date was, because it was around now - and I remember thinking it was too soon.""",6년 전(수정됨),0,

So I took what's mine by eternal right. Took your soul out into the night. It may be over but it won't stop there, I am here for you if you'd only care. You touched my heart you touched my soul. You changed my life and all my goals. And love is blind and that I knew when, My heart was blinded by you. I've kissed your lips and held your hand. Shared your dreams and shared your bed. I know you well, I know your smell. I've been addicted to you.  Chorus (2x) Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. You have been the one. You have been the one for me.  I am a dreamer and when I wake, You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take. And as you move on, remember me, Remember us and all we used to be I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile. I've watched you sleeping for a while. I'd be the father of your child. I'd spend a lifetime with you. I know your fears and you know mine. We've had our doubts but now we're fine, And I love you, I swear that's true. I cannot live without you.  Chorus (2x) Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. You have been the one. You have been the one for me.  And I still hold your hand in my mind. In my mind when I'm asleep. And I will bear my soul in time, When I'm kneeling at your feet.  Chorus (2x) Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. You have been the one. You have been the one for me.  Outro (2x) I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow.

@irenegomez5821,"So my sorry is kinda long. I had the history of art class with this guy. We kinda became friends. I just thought of him as a friend even though he was trying to get closer to me. He would go to class only the days i go. Toward the end of the year he told me he liked me face to face and I just said I had a bf( it’s true I did have). The test days he would come in take the test and wait for me and if I finish first he would finish his test fast so he will see me b4 I get to my car. Two days before class he saw me crying in my car( my ex was an asshole. He made me cry almost every day but I didn’t leave bc I loved him) he waited for me to get out and on our way to our class he kept asking what’s wrong when I finally told him it’s my ex bla bla bla. When we got to the classroom I sat and he ran out and got me a coffee ( I told him coffee always calms me a long time ago).  On the last day of the semester he again told me we should hang out sometimes but i had no interest in him in any way. He would text me asking me to grab coffee and I would say I can’t or I’m busy.... until he got it.  After a year I texted him, I had a question about our class. We finally talked and talked and he asked if we would grab coffee sometimes and I said I’m really not interested in any kind of relationship( like mentioned my ex treated me so bad and got hurt so many times) besides I kept thinking to myself we r totally different. He would rather go out and party all night long (literally) and I’d rather stay home and watch movies and so many other things. Last when we talked he told me I’ve liked u ever since we took the class together like a year and half ago and u keep rejecting me :( and then he never texted me or even talked to me again.   Two years later I went to the beach walk with my old friend from high school and I see him. He stopped and said hi to me and to my friend ( which he thought Is my new bf). I could see his smile was fake and he was sad after I rejected him and said I wasn’t ready to date he sees me after three months with this guy. Same day at 2 am he calls me (seems drunk) kept complaining to me about my “ new bf” I got mad and said why you think u have the right to ask who’s this guy and when I tell u he’s just a friend u laugh as if I’m lying. I don’t have to tell u anything. Who do U think u r ? hanged up and went to bed. But couldn’t stop thinking about him. Called him in the morning he didn’t answer I sent him. Message apologizing he didn’t answer I called him again he didn’t answer. He hates me now and WILL NOT REPLY to my calls or texts no matter how may times I apologize for being rude. What’s worse is I couldn’t stop thinking about him since the day I saw him at the beach. He’s always in my mind no matter what I’m doing and I don’t like thing. I can’t keep him outta my head and I don’t know what to do !",6년 전,0,

@captmac5627,"Got ""real"" balls?  Read on... Got myself a new ""hobby horse"" today so excuse me folks I need to ride it, here goes... Crying is a natural animal emotion. Humans do it and so do some animals. In humans, it expresses joy or sadness. Ever felt that?  It's natural so don't be afraid of it, let the tears wet your cheeks and when you feel that wetness that'll mean you've reconnected with the earliest version of yourself that ever existed - age 1 day- so celebrate it! If you don't cry, ask yourself this: am I a hard ass?  Am I a ****? Have I become so hard that I no longer feel for myself or others' joy or sadness?  Well,  let me tell you this: let's say our average age at death is 75 (in a developed country); so, work out how much longer have you got to ""go"" before you're ""gone""?   Completely GONE - food for worms? (And by the way, I have done this myself and even though I've run the numbers, AND I have a ""good"" family that loves me (I hope), I'd say I have 10 good years and then within another 30 I'll be forgotten, pretty much an annual visit at the graveyard - if I'm lucky.  Therefore, if you have 20 years left, and I'm sorry if that really means you have 10 ""good years"" left, well surely it means just don't fuck around? Ask yourself what are you gonna do with them? Hate? Pity? Reconnect with that brother, sister, son, daughter, whoever it is ... with tech today you have NO EXCUSE not to track them down even if you have to pay for it. Just don't feel sorry for yourself...cos nobody will see that and it's pointless.  Isn't your life worth more? You only have one that we ""know"" of for sure. Time is an ""asset"" like money - some have it, others don't. ""Spend"" time rather than ""wasting"" time in the same way you like to ""spend"" money rather than ""wasting"" money. Spend time on helping you be you, a better version of you and helping other people.  If you see that crying is ""natural"", the word will be better because you will have joined the ""circle"" of humanity that is awake to all the above.   For men: crying is not weakness, on the contrary! Building muscles in the gym is fine, go get them!  (But I've met so many lonely body builders!) Beers with mates are the same (are the beers joyous or just weekend escapism?)   Learn to appreciate that crying is natural so please - for your sake, not mine, just ""tune in"" to your emotions and don't be afraid  to ""BE YOU"" You have limited time to BE YOU! So, decide if you want to subscribe to BS or subscribe to your happiness.  Which is it?  Go to bed, make tomorrow a new beginning but before you go to bed do 2 things: first say this RIGHT NOW:  "" I've wasted time looking for ""greatness"" in others. I was going to copy it.  I failed because I have the wrong thinking - their greatness is theirs, not mine.  So, now I know, I understand! I'm not gong to waste time with that no more!""  Great!   Now write this and put it where you'll see it first thing in the morning (you know where that is and make sure you can see it because it will make you the best version of yourself that you have ever seen!):                                                """"""""""I’m going go inside myself and get my greatness out of ME!""""""""""""  Say this in the mirror with certainty! And I can promise you this: the ""small big men in this youtube room will ""excuse themselves and disappear into nothingness!",6년 전,0,

If you can't hear that, perhaps you don't own 10,000 albums, and listen to music nine hours a day, like I do. I encourage anyone to enjoy it, but it's not a good performance and full of flaws.

@L.Ghaleb.ER123,"This song is about a girl Blunt dated, but he wrote it years after the relationship ended. When he appeared on the UK show Songbook, Blunt explained: ""I guess it's a realization that you'll never be with someone, but the frustration that they are still alive and out there in the world. It can be an incredibly painful idea - I sat with the song for quite a long time. But for me, it's probably my most personal song. Whereas 'You're Beautiful' is about a moment, one second in time of passing that person, the song 'Goodbye My Lover' is about a lifetime's worth of emotion, the fact that that relationship is over, and that life continues. And yeah, it's the most personal song on Back To Bedlam.""",6년 전,0,

@YeeSoest,"Can I just dive right in and give you my thoughts on the line everyone is quoting in these comments? ""You can't break my spirit, it's my dreams you take"" is so SO powerful...and I feel I went through one of those dark places so I think I can somewhat relate. I think it contains both the knowledge that, yes, life will go on and you will find joy and maybe love and maybe even true love and fulfillment again... But until your mind ALWAYS puts the new partner in your dreams, both at day and at night, until they become your desire in every moment and every fantasy, they are who you expect to see when you wake up and who you expect to hear when being called by yur favorite nickname...until that happens, you will ALWAYS miss them and wonder how or why or what could be. Your hopes for the future will always have that special someone in them. They become manifested in your head as ""the one"" and until there is another one, nothing seems to make total sense, nothing ever feels 100%, it's never ""just like a dream"" with someone else and your dreams wilt and die without that person refreshing and improving upon them again and again with their sheer presence.  It's not just that you lose someone you needed, you lose all the plans and hopes and wishes, all your future and in a way even your past because who wants to hear all the great stories you shared after you split? Nobody, they die slower but they do. In that way, it all falls apart and your dreams do the same. No man dreams of living in a great house and live a great live alone, the right woman is the most essential element of that ""arriving"" where you want to be. You can have a distinct taste in houses or holiday destinations, but SHE makes the house a home, she makes seeing another place a vacation.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@igorgonzaleznunez4049,"Did I disappoint you or let you down? Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown? 'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun, Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won. So I took what's mine by eternal right. Took your soul out into the night. It may be over but it won't stop there, I am here for you if you'd only care. You touched my heart you touched my soul. You changed my life and all my goals. And love is blind and that I knew when, My heart was blinded by you. I've kissed your lips and held your head. Shared your dreams and shared your bed. I know you well, I know your smell. I've been addicted to you. Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. You have been the one. You have been the one for me. I am a dreamer but when I wake, You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take. And as you move on, remember me, Remember us and all we used to be I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile. I've watched you sleeping for a while. I'd be the father of your child. I'd spend a lifetime with you. I know your fears and you know mine. We've had our doubts but now we're fine, And I love you, I swear that's true. I cannot live without you. Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. You have been the one. You have been the one for me. And I still hold your hand in mine. In mine when I'm asleep. And I will bear my soul in time, When I'm kneeling at your feet. Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. You have been the one. You have been the one for me. I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow. I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow.",7년 전,0,

I ended up losing him and every word sung in this song literally brought me to tears, as nothing ever spoke out to me in such a way, right into my very soul inside me.  I just wanted to say thankyou Jack for every single day that we shared time together and gave up a piece of ourselves for eachother. I will never ever forget you, and you will ALWAYS be the one for me. </3  Peter.",7년 전(수정됨),13,

@miguelbetamax,"Did I disappoint you or let you down? Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown? 'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun, Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won. So I took what's mine by eternal right. Took your soul out into the night. It may be over but it won't stop there, I am here for you if you'd only care. You touched my heart you touched my soul. You changed my life and all my goals. And love is blind and that I knew when, My heart was blinded by you. I've kissed your lips and held your head. Shared your dreams and shared your bed. I know you well, I know your smell. I've been addicted to you. Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. You have been the one. You have been the one for me. I am a dreamer but when I wake, You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take. And as you move on, remember me, Remember us and all we used to be I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile. I've watched you sleeping for a while. I'd be the father of your child. I'd spend a lifetime with you. I know your fears and you know mine. We've had our doubts but now we're fine, And I love you, I swear that's true. I cannot live without you. Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. You have been the one. You have been the one for me. And I still hold your hand in mine. In mine when I'm asleep. And I will bear my soul in time, When I'm kneeling at your feet. Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. You have been the one. You have been the one for me. I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow. I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow.",7년 전,0,

But we are even closer now as they knew how things went.. Only bit of advice I'd give is.. Be there. When needed.. And never speak ill of thier mum, as much as you'd sometimes want to.. Which ain't easy.. But be be honest if asked questions.. Kids will always love you for just being dad...it's certainly tough and there's no magic formula to getting over splits..

Everyone has their part to play at these events, it would be a completely different performance. If James held a phone whilst playing the piano and singing. He could probably pull it off but just would poor compared to this performance. If you ever record at events do you find yourself more subjective? I know I do that's why I switch off and attempt to enjoy it. I actually wonder if it might be considered selfish  to do that instead of giving the artist free exposure anyway that's like another debate.

@timmbrockmann959," @kevintablet743  found this interesting:  During my interview with Greil Marcus, music journalist, scholar, and author of the acclaimed “Mystery Train: Images of America in Rock ‘n’ Roll Music,” he spoke about the joy of truly experiencing an event while watching a live performance. “Some people come to life on stage,” Marcus said. “On stage they don’t know what’s going to happen next…and that sense of uncertainty and unpredictability creates a kind of excitement that just can’t be replicated anywhere else.”  That level of excitement never reaches its full threshold when holding up a phone to record the show, as it creates a wall between yourself and the performer. It generates a sort of shield that protects the audience member from connecting with the artist. “When you’re holding up your cell phone and you’re recording a video of a performance, you are yourself representing it rather than experiencing it directly,” Marcus said. “You’re putting distance between yourself--emotional, physical, technological--and the performance.”",6년 전,0,

@bloodlustshiva1,"I know I'm a random stranger on the internet, but I wanted to tell you that I'm somebody that deals with depression every single day. While I don't know what's hurt you, or how deeply you've been wounded, I just wanted you to know that I hope you can overcome that pain. Each and every one of us in the world can reach out and try to lift one another up, even when we don't feel that we can take another step ourselves. I can't claim that this song speaks to me, as I've never gone that far with anyone, but I did had a girl that I grew up with, and only discovered that the feeling strongest I had for her was love, after she and her family had moved away, with no way of contacting her. 21 years later and it still hurts. I guess what I'm trying to say is keep going, and push past the pain in any way you can without destroying yourself. If you can still be sad, if you can still feel pain, then there's still hope for you. I wish you the best.",7년 전,7,

@PeterMurphy-cf6ys," @roadrunner4449  Well he did, he wrote it with someone.",6년 전,0,
@Jessica_Roth," @roadrunner4449  James wrote it while he was staying at Carrie Fisher's house in LA.  Sacha Skarbek later added to it and got a co-writer credit (the same as he did for ""You're Beautiful"" and Miley Cyrus's ""Wrecking Ball""), but the basics go back to James.  Artists performing ""personal"" songs is different for each one.  Roger Waters has been doing Pink Floyd's ""Brain Damage"" (the track from ""Dark Side of the Moon"" with the title phrase in the chorus) for over 40 years, and there's a lot of unearned guilt in those lyrics.  (It's Waters imagining Floyd founder Syd Barrett accusing Roger of not being there during Syd's mental breakdown troubles and subsequent lobotomy [which obviously left Syd in no condition to make such charges] and warning Roger that one of these days, he'll fall apart the same way and ""I'll see you on the dark side of the moon."")  OTOH, Taylor Swift has never been able to make herself perform ""Breathe"", which is allegedly Taylor apologizing to her ex-fiddle player, Emily, for not fighting hard enough to keep her in the band when management kicked her out because (allegedly) Taylor and Emily were dating and they were worried about TS's image (again, allegedly).  So, all those ""I'm sorry"" lyrics have never been sung live.  It's different for everyone.  Maybe every time James performs this song, he heals the pain of losing the lover who left him ""so hollow"".  At least, I hope so.  (Well, I hope he's over it completely by now.  But you never know.)",6년 전,0,

@fegabe999,"Did I disappoint you or let you down? Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown? 'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun. Yes, I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won.  So, I took what's mine by eternal right, Took your soul out into the night. It may be over but it won't stop there. I am here for you if you'd only care.  You touched my heart, you touched my soul, You changed my life and all my goals. And love is blind, and that I knew, when My heart was blinded by you.  I've kissed your lips and held your head. Shared your dreams and shared your bed. I know you well, I know your smell. I've been addicted to you.  [2x] Goodbye, my lover. Goodbye, my friend. You have been the one. You have been the one for me.  I am a dreamer, And when I wake, You can't break my spirit. It's my dreams you take.  And as you move on, Remember me, Remember us, And all we used to be.  I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile. I've watched you sleeping for a while. I'd be the father of your child. I'd spend a lifetime with you.  I know your fears and you know mine. We've had our doubts but now we're fine. And I love you, I swear that's true. I cannot live without you.  [2x] Goodbye, my lover. Goodbye, my friend. You have been the one. You have been the one for me.  And I still hold your hand in mine, In mine when I'm asleep. And I will bare my soul in time, When I'm kneeling at your feet.  [2x] Goodbye, my lover. Goodbye, my friend. You have been the one. You have been the one for me.  I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow. I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow. I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow.

@grunerbaum2639,"James Blunt, a gifted musician. All his songs are touching but also hurtful at the same time. I think everyone has been through what he had to experience. A while ago, I ended the relationship with my girlfriend. I saw no other possibility. It felt as if you were struck by a bullet in the heart. After a few days we wrote to each other. I thought we should not let go and look for new partners. But actually I wanted to be back with her and enjoy her love, which she had not given me at that time. A few sentences later we started fighting and broke off the contact for the time being. And now she hates me, sends me pictures with her new friend and how happy she is with him. I, however, lie in my bed listening to the music that reminds me of that time. I think that James would tell us that we humans, we love should hold, even if it's hard. Because these people can change something in your life that you could not create. Sorry if the translation is not 100%. I'm just a student from Germany.",8년 전,2,

@joannah1887,"GOODBYE MY LOVER by JAMES BLUNT This song is about a girl Blunt dated, but he wrote it years after the relationship ended. When he appeared on the UK show Songbook, Blunt explained: ""I guess it's a realization that you'll never be with someone, but the frustration that they are still alive and out there in the world. It can be an incredibly painful idea - I sat with the song for quite a long time. But for me, it's probably my most personal song. Whereas 'You're Beautiful' is about a moment, one second in time of passing that person, the song 'Goodbye My Lover' is about a lifetime's worth of emotion, the fact that that relationship is over, and that life continues. And yeah, it's the most personal song on Back To Bedlam.""",8년 전,61,

@notjustharry,"The lyrics of this song sort of seem like an apology to me. ""Did I disappoint you or let you down. Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown"" and ""I saw the end before it begun, I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won"" kinda seems like James may have taken advantage of the trust he had with a presumed lover. I hear a lot of regret and pain in the words. He understands that it's the end but he is still there for her even after admitting his fault and realising things won't be the same. ""So I took what's mine by eternal right"" He took the blame perhaps? Only part I cannot determine is ""My heart was blinded by you"" Since the lyrics point towards a past tense it's hard to determine whether or not this was at the start of the relationship and he fell out of love or he loved her all the way through until he got over her.  Maybe if I completely contradict myself and say that ""Did I disappoint you or let you down. Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown"" is a literal question as he is confused as to why she left him. I don't know man, it's 4:11AM and i'm just trying to occupy myself and just so happened to stumbled across this video. Also, people holding their mobile phones during this man's performance is absolutely preposterous.  Whether or not you agree, feel free to express your opinions.  P.S. Obviously he has been hurt in the past. There's no way someone can sing a song with that much passion if it didn't have such a profound effect on them. Generally an effect of that magnitude is negative and results in pain.",8년 전,0,

And it also just leaves me aghast how much passion he put into this performance.  Just amazing... really inspirational.  Watching this makes me cry every time despite having seen it before. I guess I'm just an overly emotional sap, but hey. Just seeing his tortured expressions make me want to give him a big hug. Allowing yourself to connect that much with your emotions whilst keeping on performing like that (especially singing and playing at the same time) is an art form and takes a lot of skill.  I'm trying to take a leaf out of his book and put more feeling. Into my own singing and playing. I have him to thank for motivating me to keep singing and keep improving and keep striving.",8년 전,78,

@michaelmcconville6065,"This song is about a girl Blunt dated, but he wrote it years after the relationship ended. When he appeared on the UK show Songbook, Blunt explained: ""I guess it's a realization that you'll never be with someone, but the frustration that they are still alive and out there in the world. It can be an incredibly painful idea - I sat with the song for quite a long time. But for me, it's probably my most personal song. Whereas 'You're Beautiful' is about a moment, one second in time of passing that person, the song 'Goodbye My Lover' is about a lifetime's worth of emotion, the fact that that relationship is over, and that life continues. And yeah, it's the most personal song on Back To Bedlam.""",7년 전,14,
