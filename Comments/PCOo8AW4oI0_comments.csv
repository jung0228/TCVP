@VioletLoralai,"Been there, I'm 26 now and get to dress however I want. But from my experience, it seems like your mom has good values. I don't think it's right for young girls to wear ""revealing"" clothes, something I didn't realize till I gained some more experience in life. That doesn't mean that you can't wear a crop top and make it not revealing, I have a rule that if my top is more risky I wear high-waisted or more covering bottoms and vice versa. Also I don't know if you have this kind of relationship, but you should try talking to your mom about this as you get older and make it clear to her that you have a passion for outward expression and style more as your getting older and that it would mean a lot to you if you two could explore and meet halfway on certain trends or styles you're into. Honestly wish I had tried that with my mom, could've saved me years of fashion mistakes ❤   Worst case scenario your stuck in the same position till you're old enough...Best case scenario it could be a great way to bond with your mom instead of that all too familiar frustrated/almost embarrassed feeling when clothing shopping with a parent.",3년 전(수정됨),10,

@aparna12242," @ZurditaDinamita  Exactly. Islam like others doesn't hold back from entertaining female subordination and misogyny when it comes to self expression. I mean, that's unfortunately the harsh truth. It's sad to see soo many brainwashed people giving up their human rights in the name of religion.  I mean how is it living life on your own terms when you cannot even wear what you want to? A very close muslim friend of mine used to constantly tell me how sad and depressed she feels when she sees me wear cute outfits of my choice and it truly hurts to see her bound by religion like that :(",4년 전,26,
@aparna12242,"   I wasn’t talking about those who chose to follow Islam. Of course if females chose it then it’s their right to and it’s their path so nobody needs to give opinions, I agree with you. I was talking about those who were “forced” to and where I am from unfortunately there are many many such cases. Young girls do get brainwashed and unfortunately that is the truth. There have even been cases where young girls from other religions where brain washed by young muslim men solely for the purpose of converting them into muslims and there are accounts of the brutality those women had faced. Like you said I guess I was talking about the wrong Islam but that wrong islam is very prevalent in my country so my comment was mostly on that. These are true, real stories. I don’t know where you are from but in my place I have witnessed many accounts such as this. My friend I mentioned about got beaten up and almost disowned by her family all in the name of religion when she wore a half sleeve t-shirt once. Half sleeve t-shirt.. I mean what the heck that’s just inhumane and she is forced to follow this religion that she wants to escape from but she is unable to do so. Yes women may have rights but not enough to be able to express. Many muslim women I know personally don’t have that privilege but if you do, then I am happy.",4년 전(수정됨),15,
@aparna12242,"   You are very lucky indeed. I wish more people would understand and reflect on the positive aspects of the faith they follow and imbibe that into their lives and other people’s lives. Hopefully things change for better. This is not just about Islam but every religion that has its own dark side and it completely taints the true intent of having faith in a religion. I’m an atheist but I never looked down upon those who chose to follow any form of faith or religion, as long as it doesn’t become detrimental to another person’s well being that is. Seeing people being stripped down of their own human rights in the name of religion, that goes against a person’s personal choice/will doesn’t sit with me well.

@aparna12242,"​ @Marrrrrrr1  Lol I guess you folks gets insecure seeing women who are confident in their own skin and have basic human rights to express themselves. ""Men-made liberal ideologies"": sounds like you are the one who is brain washed and delusional. Women wear whatever they feel confident it and it is not always to impress ""men"" and because of ""years of brainwash"" narrative. The fact that you bring in only men when we are living in the 21st century : What about lesbians? Trans? Gays? Homosexuality ✨exists and they have been around forever? Skirts and high heels were first worn by men. Go check your history books.Where is equality? Why do muslim men not cover up themselves head to toe all the time? In that light, isn;t this entire concept super sexist and misogynistic?    I am sticking my nose in my muslim friends business as they come to me saying they have no freedom at home and that they are being forced against their will to wear hijabs. Seems like you don't want to acknowledge the existence of these girls who are suffering. Nice try covering up the other side of the story all in the name of a religion. Sad  Where is equality? Why do muslim men not cover up themselves head to toe all the time? In that light, isn;t this entire concept super sexist and misogynistic?   You are cool with it, good for you but stop assuming ""all muslim girls"" are living a comfortable life under their hijabs out there. Come to India and you'll see a different picture. Of course there are girls here who are happy and do it because they want to but many are forced their family and their excuse is always  that their religion demands it so yes, it does tie back to religion. Also why are all the muslim girls in the comments section crying saying they wish they could wear these outfits? Doesn't that say something?",4년 전(수정됨),5,
@arshiyabegum8556,Aparna Islam tells women to wear hijab and modest clothes and men to wear loose and decent clothes so it’s not just women that have restrictions. And Islam doesn’t force us it’s the people who take the wrong idea. Families force their children then the problem is family not Islam. Don’t say shit if you are not a Muslim bc you don’t know anything. Yes in Islam  women seem to have more restrictions bc some men don’t want women to succeed and like to oppress. Don’t say anything bad about Islam if you don’t know,4년 전,0,
@arshiyabegum8556,Aparna and also in India many families don’t allow their children to wear shorts or crop tops but they are not Muslims so according to you Hindu is bad no right it’s the family,4년 전,0,
@aparna12242," @arshiyabegum8556  “Men to wear loose and modest clothes” sure. Is that why the majority of the muslim men around me are walking in skinny denims, shorts and sleeveless shirts? Asking men to wear loose clothes ain’t the same as asking women to cover up including their hair. 😶 Clearly, there is a big difference.  As I said, the “families” excuse is that Islam makes them do it. So clearly, if there is an increasing number of violence against muslim women in their own households, the religion is definitely triggering it too.",4년 전,1,
@aparna12242," @arshiyabegum8556  They don’t allow them only until they are independent though. Also asking them not to wear something versus making them wear something as a “rule” is different. There are no such harsh doctrines like the ones you see in Islam. I am married women in my 30s and I wear whatever I want to and my husband has no issues with it. In fact, times have changed and other religions are way more liberal in comparison. And nobody “disowns” their children just because they refuse to abide by rules while many muslim women have been disowned and thrown out of their house for going against rules and they say it’s all in the name of Islam.

Choose a turtleneck that is skintight and doesn't bunch as much. Use an oversized tshirt that is more wide.  Use a men's t-shirt, men's t-shirts have more room at the arms and the sleeves are a lot longer. I look for the sleeves that hit my elbows.

The Bible predicted all of this and it's coming to pass as were speaking right now.     JESUS LOVES YOU!!.....The Kingdom Of God is at hand Repent and believe the Gospel and the good news was that the kingdom of Heaven had come near to us. The presence and the Glory of Heaven is available to us here; here on earth righteousness, joy and peace in the Holy Spirit (Romans 14:17), the power of Heaven we could experience it right here in this world. Jesus said you could experience but you first have to Repent and make a decision to turn away from your sins and trust in Jesus. To Repent it means to return to God, Let go of your sins and return to God with all of your heart, Making a decision to turn away from your sins and following Jesus and believe in the Good news that Christ Jesus on the cross payed in full for our sins (1 Peter 3:18). Jesus on the cross became sin so that you and I may become the righteousness of God ( 2 Corinthians 5:21) this is the good news that God came to bring us. Jesus was wounded for our transgression, He was bruised for our inequities: the chastisement for our peace was upon him and by his striped we are healed (Isaiah 53:5). You can receive this good news, Jesus came to bring us Eternal Life, Jesus came to bring us Forgiveness (John 3:16) and you can receive this great news today. The most Important decision you can make in your life today is to receive forgiveness and Eternal Life. If you have never received Jesus into your heart, If you have never asked him to come into your heart, and If you have never made this decision. You can make this decision right now God will forgive you of your sins, he'll give you life, and God will fill you with his Holy spirit. I want to encourage you today and simply close your eyes and pray this prayer from your heart to the Lord say:  Jesus I make a decision today to turn away from my sins and I come to you with all of my heart, forgive me Lord, cleanse my heart, give me a new heart  Jesus I receive you into my heart  Jesus I believe that you died on the cross and I believe you was raised from the dead and I believe your coming back soon  Jesus fill me with your Holy spirit I belong to you today and forever. AMEN!!!  If you prayed that prayer you just received Eternal Life!!! John 3:16 says that ""that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have Eternal Life.""  Jesus has just came into your heart through the Holy Spirit and you have been born again.",5년 전,0,

@stridery,"5:43 So I noticed people from other ethnicities do not like to be called exotic. For me as a white woman, describing someone as exotic is always in an admiring way, tan/dark skin, wavy hair, different face features than us regular white women etc. I'm from the Netherlands, me and my friends often wish to have those features ourselves because we think it is beautiful. I mean, regular white woman are pretty boring, we all look the same don't we. In the Dutch bubble where I live, saying someone looks exotic, means someone is looking different but beautiful. Is this perceived different in other places of the world? Am I overlooking something? Please educate me, so I can learn :)",5년 전,0,

If you don’t own any of these clothes then congrats I guess...maybe this video doesn’t cater to your style 2. You’re not too fat for ANY of these outfits. She’s giving you a BASE. When buying clothes you need to find clothes that cater to your body shape, not copy the ones Ashley owns. For example, Mom jeans look terrible on me. So you know what I do? NOT BUY THEM. Find jeans that flatter you. Boyfriend jeans. Bell bottoms. There’s so many options. It might take a hell of a lot of time but that’s the point. She’s just showing you how you can fashion it up. Not only that but she’s also telling you a lot about colour, balance, juxtaposition, etc.  3. If you find that it’s REALLy difficult to find clothes that flatter you learn about altering your silhouette and how to tailor your own clothes.",5년 전(수정됨),2,

@Iluvfeet28,"Comment includes a list of basics u should buy so keep reading!!! for those complaining about not having enough clothes i was definitely there with you but over the year i’ve slowly built my closet up from thrifting and i’d like to compile a list of clothes you should get first: -mom jeans or more loose fitting jeans sort of a rare find but if ur on the smaller side check the kids section. get a light wash and black one -skinny jeans make sure EVERY jean u get is high waisted. -fitted t-shirt’s (black, white, creme, colored) - loose graphic tees (u can find these in abundance) -black denim and light wash denim jackets very important and you can save up and buy new bc i wear them on the daily -cardigans or zipups in simple colors.  -white and black sneakers -black joggers (tapered to the bottom) -black and white turtle necks  - hoodies for casual days  these clothes are all VERY easy to mix and match so you can look like you have more clothes than you actually do and A LOT of them are easy to find at the thrift store others you might have to but new.   don’t be scared about how long the list looks bc you can take your time building it up and depending in your situation it might be easier to build up than you especially if you’re thrifting these.    items to get after you accumulated the basics: -cool pants (plaid pants, striped pants, flowy are pants) that aren’t too bold. they can have color but they shouldn’t be too bright) same goes for cooler shirts (the cut of the shirt and pants matter too - accessories (chains, belts, cross body bags, side bags, fanny packs, and jewelry)  - more sneakers (u can easily thrift converse) or heels (also easy to thrift) -and whatever you think is fashionable because overtime you do develop a sense of fashion -dresses (not very practical so thts why it’s on this section bc you shouldn’t be buying dresses when you first build ur closet unless it’s absolutely perfect) -skirts   i don’t want to come off like i think i’m a pro. this is from personal experience and tips i would’ve loved when i started first buying clothes. i only bought colorful and trendy stuff and i thought i’d get a lot of wear out of them but i didn’t. BUY BASICS and timeless pieces that can last a long time and match with everything before getting in with statements pieces.   and these should looks good on all body types and you can always buy something else over something i recommend if it caters to your body better. and to the ppl tht feel ugly trust me dressing up does A LOT for you. ur hair also matters btw. so dress for urself and feel more confident.   another tip coming from a short person tht EVERYONE should do is to tuck in their shirts because that makes u looks more put together. adding accessories also makes u look more fashionable like ashley’s first example of changing up jeans and t-shirt.",6년 전(수정됨),1,

@Iluvfeet28,also leggings might be comfy but THEYRE NOT PANTS so don’t put wearing it with shirt above the crotch area. it’s ok to leisure in with a hoodie or large t-shirt but they aren’t something to be worn in the place of jeans or joggers.   TRACKPANTS are cool just wear a fitted top to show ur waistline and to balance out the bagginess. only get pants tht rise to your bellybutton or higher. they’re more comfortable and makes ur legs look taller.,6년 전,0,

@mtlinh,"I used to have the same problem but not anymore when I realized that I couldn't change my community but I definitely didn't want to be boring for my whole life. What makes you uncomfortable the most is actually your inside thoughts and believe me, that was my biggest problem. But the more you dress the way you want, you will eventually not care about people anymore because wearing what you like actually makes you feel so good that you can have enough energy for the whole day.  You can start with something minor that people only notice when they look carefully or they will forget after 5 minutes like wearing tops that are just a little brighter than the colors you usually wear with your normal pans or wearing dresses that have interesting styles but in neutral colors, so people won't notice that much even though they can feel something new but are not bothered enough to say anything, but the most important thing is that you feel better wearing something you actually like without attracting attention. And I can tell you, that feeling is so addictive that you will gradually not care about what people think anymore and wear whatever you want. This process don't usually take that long haha, what you change here is not people's attitude but actually your mind, making you feel more self-confident about yourself.

@meeeeeee-vr8xd," @winterpang641  It's a style video.  Yes, she may be skinny, but that doesn't take away the fact that the focus should be on the clothing.  If you actually listen to the video, Ashley gives out wonderful information about styling, and how to find clothes that compliment your body, and your vibe.  There are plenty of ways that plus sized people can look good in clothing, and depending on how much effort you are willing to put in, it shouldn't matter how much weight you have, because it should be clothing that makes YOU look good and feel good.  If your confidence drops down because of seeing another person who is skinnier than you, then I hope you read this and come to understand that beauty is so much more than how much you weigh.  I personally believe that anyone who bases beauty on weight needs to re-evaluate their definition of beauty.",6년 전,75,

She looks bomb af, stop feeling sorry for yourselves, the only one that thinks something looks bad on you IS you!  and if you really are so uncomfortable then do something about it, i know i did! I lost 15kg in 3 month because i wasn't happy with my weight gain, and now i'm toned because i eat healthy and workout!",6년 전,3,

Have you noticed that she doesn’t mention anything bad about other people’s body shapes, and show herself in PJ’s and a messy bun, how she creates a base of good out fit outfit ideas for people to justify. Basically what all of you guys are saying that is that, she can’t post videos because of the way she dresses. She also put lots of effort into the video, again if you don’t feel comfortable or something than I accept that because she is skinny but there is no need to say this stuff.",6년 전,0,

@caseyd4689,"A lot of people are stressin' in the comments because they have no good clothes. Let me tell you something - Ross is a very good place to go if you don't like thrift stores. I wanted to ""up my outfit game"" so I tried Ross because my sister suggested we go. It's a hit or miss store which kind of sucks, but it's always worth the shot. The clothes range from like $3-$15 usually which is pretty good.  But if you still think that's a lot, try out a thrift store. Many people go to Goodwill, but I personally prefer a Salvation Army thrift store. I actually went yesterday and got 1 skirt, 7 shirts, 1 dress, and 1 sweater all for $34! My go-to place before thrift stores or Ross was Kohl's, but for $34 I could literally buy like 2 graphic tees there. It may not be your ideal option, but I was pretty against it myself until I saw the range of things I could get. Give it a shot, you may be pleasantly surprised.   For a few tips, here are some of my suggestions:   -If you have some old shirts you don't usually wear, try looking up some shirt cutting tutorials. I personally don't like to cut up my old shirts, but I did buy a plain blue shirt from the thrift store and I cut off the entire neckline so it was off the shoulder and when paired with a black skirt... dang it looks good.  -In general, try to repurpose old clothes. If you don't like a pair of jeans, cut them up!  -Many shirts (if they seem boring) can easily be paired with a black skirt or jeans if you tuck it in. I use this a lot and I love it. -If you have shirts you don't like because they are too long, crop them. If I do this, I'll usually also cut the sleeves and collar so it looks more ""natural"" -Encourage yourself to go through your closet. If you find clothes you don't wear often, donate them. A lot of people keep clothes they don't wear (I'm super guilty about this) and it takes up space. You either just don't like them or honestly forgot about them. Regardless, if you clear up some space you may discover what you're looking for and it may help you realize what kinds of clothes you want! -Walmart has some pretty interesting shoe options. I got a cute pair of sneakers once. If you're in need of some new shoes, try to look for some there.   And for my final tip, DO NOT buy clothes you feel pressured to wear. I was a very self-conscious middle schooler and many of my old shirts and shorts are much longer than I'd wear now just so I could cover myself up. As I got into maybe 7th grade, I bought a couple really short-shorts and a crop top I wore once. I was a chubby kid and I still am. I did not like my style, but I didn't like to show off my body. I now wear these items because they're more appropriate at my age, but don't make yourself uncomfortable. I still find days where crop tops I love just don't suit my stomach AND THAT'S OKAY! Just wear clothes you like, not for anyone else. You'll save money and all around just be happier.    I hope this helps someone out there :)",6년 전,1,

Patterns that generally go well together: a) geometric and non-geometric, for example stripes and clouds b) bold and small, for example big flowers and small polka dots.",6년 전,0,

I used to be really good at coordinating clothing when I was younger and since I got to uni and put on a bit of weight, I turned to t-shirts, jeans and hoodies 💔😹 4 yrs later, I've just graduated and have time to finally start looking after myself again.. and watching this gave me a nice boost to help me improvise outfits that I have in my wardrobe ✨ I have quite a drastic hourglass figure (with XL hips, S waist and XXL just) so it's quite difficult to make things work for me without looking like a chunky box! But watching this has helped spark some ideas and I finally have a tonne of outfits I can wear everyday! I don't even care if im looking too fancy for the grocery store, it makes me feel so happy again!

@inkbery4473," @Φοίβη-λ6ρ  it's mostly a cultural thing. I mean, a lot of girls I know like to dress like that. Some do wear hijab, but when boys aren't there they like to wear dresses and stuff. Some, like me, just aren't into being too revealing, even when not wearing a hijab. It depends on how you were raised and who you were surrounded with.  Whatever you wear almost never takes away from being Muslim, though, that still stands no matter what, and we have no right to call each other out on not being ""Muslim enough""",6년 전,19,

@mitokkiii,layering is the best thing ever especially if you wanna go modest it can work really well so those tips were pretty helpful however i dont really have the confidence to wear some of the more freebee legs out shoulders out kinda thing and im not exactly that slim either but another tip to know is you can always use black leggings and wear anything like a miniskirt or shorts on top as a way to layer the bottom as well whilst still being concealed and modest. (also great for winter as well) Theres a lot of ways to look modest while still being fashionable uwu,6년 전,0,

Stop shaming yourself or complaining that your body isn’t “thin” enough, every body shapes is beautiful ( as long as they are healthy ) and doing the above is just drowning your self esteem in doubts. Don’t you think that commenting that Ashley’s clothes look good on her just because she is thin is quite rude ? Her clothes look good because put effort into it and figure out what’s best for her body shape not just because she is thin, don’t sum it all to the word “thin”",6년 전,1,

@ohmymathilda7238," @Charuid  there's a difference between having diagnosed mental issues and lack of self esteem. Second of all there is a difference between having mental health issues and constantly being down on yourself at every chance you get. I've been there and as soon as you try not to say/ write anything negative about yourself it helps. Its not easy, but always shitting on yourself doesn't improve yourself and its not healthy coping. So yeah, be kind to yourself, because hating yourself will get you now where.",6년 전,2,
@Charuid, @ohmymathilda7238  Diagnosed mental problems often go hand in hand with poor self-esteem.,6년 전,1,
@ohmymathilda7238," @Charuid  yeah, but not all people abuse themselves at every chance they get. I know how hard that is and I'm not shitting on people, believe me. But this mentality of ""I'm not neurotypical so I can't love myself and am exempt from taking responsibility for how I treat myself"" Is dangerous and very limiting for yourself. You strip away your own power of self healing and getting better. So yeah, we are at a disadvantage, but saying ""I can't do this because that dopamine be missing uwu"" is not the way to respond to someone saying that you could try to be more kind to yourself.",6년 전,2,
@Charuid," @ohmymathilda7238  I honestly despise the original comment. It's worded in a way that seems belittling and like she's taking the piss on actually mentally ill. My comment was a reflection on that and thus polarized and exaggerated. Obviously people should be kinder to themselves. It's hard, some days even impossible, but constant self-loathing isn't the answer either. I do get your point, just really didn't like the initial comment and got honestly quite triggered, lol.",6년 전,0,

@orchidcreme,"the reason why you feel this way is because it is a perception that you created of yourself. basically, you have always thought and said negative things and that eventually lead to this awful feeling. i know that self-deprecating jokes are a way to cope but they can also damage your perception.  the way you perceive yourself is how everyone will see you as. if you are positive and confident, people will follow along. however, if you are negative then most people will think that you are. it can be hard to achieve control and balance over how you think about yourself. but when done in baby steps, it will become an achievement that you feel happy to have reached. i don’t need to describe these “steps”, as it is mostly self-explanatory already.  however, do not anyone warp this perception that you have made for yourself and tell you the opposite of what you believe. in other words, try your best to avoid negativity from others that don’t have a saying in your life. their criticism is not valid unless you believe it and take it heavily.  so good luck and i hope this helps you. ❤️",6년 전,1,

If you own a lot of hoodies, find a skirt or jeans somewhere and tuck the hoodie in, then pull a bit out for a relaxed look. Try to find a leather jacket somewhere, and put that on over the hoodie. Then get some sneakers (preferably high tops), and wear those with some crew socks, maybe. And if you think you’re ugly or fat, which you’re probably not, maybe diet (if you want). If you think you’re ugly, which, again, you’re probably not, put on a little makeup (again, if you want). If the hoodie thing doesn’t work, try to find a thrift store near you, they usually have good clothes, and if you need to adjust the clothes, do so! I hope this helped. Stay positive 😁",5년 전,0,

@a11i44,"See it would be a lot easier to find interesting outfits to wear if I were thin like that and therefore didn't have to worry about VERY unflattering silhouettes and loose jeans or many layers of clothes with extra fabric making me look like a literal house.   But more importantly if my leg hair weren't so dark and coarse and noticeable that I have to shave before showing even a bit ankle and by the end of the day I have 5 o'clock leg shadow....   Seriously though, showing any leg at all is not just an everyday thing for me and it seriously limits my outfit options, especially in the summer. I gotta plan that shit and shave the night before (because it takes too long to do in the morning) and then I can only get away with MAYBE 2 days of showing leg because the black hairs and inevitable red shaving irritation bumps are so noticeable on my ghost pale skin, and then I have to wait over a week to get enough hair growth to shave again without tearing up the skin on my legs even more.   But hey maybe if I had a million subscribers on YouTube I could afford laser hair removal 👍  And for all you ladies doing the feminist no-shave thing, go for it and I'm happy you're fighting to make it more socially acceptable, but none of y'all would be so confident to show your legs if instead of that peach fuzz or random one dark pube looking thing here or there on your legs you had to deal with the evolutionary throwback to a gorilla creature that is MY lower legs. I don't see many of y'all rocking that shit, it ain't cute or empowering.",6년 전,0,

@malenaboeva6759," @karolinerosa6399  i agree but i feel like her closet is all in the same style and everything goes well with everything. whereas my closest is a total mess and even if i can pull off 3 or 4 great outfits the rest is a mess. like i have pieces i bought because i liked how they fit me but don't really go with anything else in my closet. thats why i think that when you have created a functional closet like hers you can't really be in the ""nothing to wear"" situation.",6년 전(수정됨),37,
@elenanojkovic2554," @malenaboeva6759  I kind of agree with both you an Karolina Rose. This why whenever I go shopping, or even pick trough hand-me-downs I got from someone I focus on what goes with clothes in my wardrobe.  I think the titlw of the video should be more like 'things to wear when you have no inspiration' because this is what happens to me. Full wardrobe, but with a lot of clothes I've been wearing for ages (seriously, I have stuff from 6th and 8th grade and I'm in third year of uni) so sometimes I run out of ideas how to wear them and I don't wanz to throw those away since I don't have enough money to buy a whole new wardrobe.",6년 전(수정됨),9,
@jolyte," @malenaboeva6759  i gotta disagree with you there.. sis gave us preppy school girl, emo chic, casual baddie, monochrome  realness and some funky looking pattern mixing. there were so many different styles in this video and a lot of them would not go together usually, but she made it work with the accessories and color palettes.  when you have ""nothing to wear"" it's usually because you lack the creativity to mix unusual garments together. like karoline said, you gotta focus on the tips, not what she has in her closet.",6년 전,11,

I'm 22, from NorCal, and my closet looks so similar to the pieces you show in these vids, so I love seeing new ideas on how to repurpose items I already own.  I have a request! Berets! I have a black beret, and a sort of mustard one, and I always want to wear them but the outfits I put together never feel like they fit right, so I alway end up taking it off at the last min. Berets are so cute and maybe nostalgic feeling, but I'm afraid I only like them in theory. SOS, sis!!

Your videos are really well done, clever, witty and remind me a bit of a couple characters from TV. (Carrie Bradshaw and Sophia Marlowe from Girlboss). Perhaps you could make a video specifically targeted towards younger girls (you may have already and I have not seen them :) My 9 year old niece is also into sewing (taught by her grandma) and your videos would be great for both girls to watch. Hope you don't think that I am trying to be negative or critical because like I said, I love your videos and think that your humor is great.

@threem43,"I don't know why some of you say ""these just work for you because your tiny and slim"". Sure she looks like this, this is her body type and that's the body type she can put clothes on. And combining your clothes differently is something everybody can do. Put on accessories to a boring t-shirt, you can crop your jeans even with legs that are not that slim. Maybe don't put the t-shirt in the jeans if it doesn't look good on you. Put on a belt is something everybody can do. turtlenecks under a blouse that looks good on you works also for more than just people with zero fat.  And you don't have dress like that in the first place if it doesn't look good on you or doesn't fit your body type. It's about what you already have. If you own or buy a dress, think about maybe sweaters that could look good over it or maybe a turtleneck under it. It's not that hard. I get that you watch this, just like me and think I can't wear this. But we don't have to^^ and we probably won't. Just use YOUR wardrobe and what fits you differently.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

Let me tell you you can pull it off girl I'm 4 11 and I'm all torso, it's about finding the confidence and although some of these Styles may not work for you finding something that well I would suggest something with a higher waist line or the type of jeans that flare out towards the end they make you look a little bit taller and are more flattering.",6년 전,8,
@lunam9376,"Hi love I actually do exactly everything that Ashley does currently since high school (im 23 now) LOL. I am 5'1'. And all these have saved my life when I was super broke before and even now (thrifting to regular shopping). I found that when wearing these types of outfits, a lot of the focus has to do with your waist and the length of the skirts and pants and how much skin should or shouldn't be showing.  I found shorter skirts make my legs look a lot longer. I cuff my pants slightly above my ankles (and it's a lot more flattering when it's tapered). I love how Ashley gave those belt ideas because that's how I always do my cheap hems. Belts save lives (almost ALL of my belts are thrifted, I also bought a belt hole puncher to make the belt tighter).  Another tip I got from one of my model friends (she's fkin like 5'9' tho so it's not like she needs these tips LMFAO) was that you should wear strapless heels/sandals during the summer because apparently it makes you look a lot taller? I don't really notice much of a difference but that's what her agency tells her.  My hair is also incredibly long so a certain amount of hair length also helps you look taller too from what I noticed, since my hair is super long now (past my butt) it makes me look much shorter since my hair makes me look a bit boxy sometimes.  And lastly (from what I can think of), ANGLES. Ashley always has her camera pointed up from wherever she is filming. I ALWAYS take pictures/videos of myself with the camera slightly angled up towards me and this makes you look more elongated.  Hope these help ~",6년 전,4,

@kir-is-here,"N M Taylor I’m no fashion youtubers but I have a few tips! 1) try wearing a more winter-y skirt with black tights while it’s colder outside. Thick tights don’t show much skin at all, and that way you can get used to wearing skirts! 2) little shorts are often in the lingerie section of stores and they’re often called spandex. But I personally would recommend going to a store that sells sports equipment/clothing! Athletes wear spandex shorts under their uniforms, and in my opinion those ones don’t slide around as much as the lingerie ones do :)",6년 전,3,
@Goldlucky13,"I'm also not a fashion expert, but I (almost) always end up wearing bike shorts under my skirts/dresses. They hug your body very tightly so there is hardly ever a seam line noticeable on the skirt unless you wear a bodycon skirt/dress. It gives me more confidence while wearing them since I don't have to worry about accidentally flashing anyone! i also use plain tights or leggings under them. Thin ones with patterns or designs sometimes catch people's eye more than I like, so plain ones (even thin ones!) typically aren't too noticeable to gross men, unless they're really perving on you.  I don't have much advice for getting over that mindset, since there is nothing wrong with wanting to cover up if it makes you more comfortable. But if you want to try it out, get used to wearing shorter skirts around your house first, dance around in them, and realize how cute you look! Hang out with girl friends who will support you and make you feel confident while you're out (:",6년 전,1,

@CattyMcMeow,"Helps to be super thin so that you can literally wear anything you want and not worry if it makes you look like an overstuffed sausage (no shame in your weight, by the way! You look great) I used to be your size. Oh, how it was easy to dress in those days. Even frumpy clothes looked cute. Then, age 21 hit, my hormones said ""eh...fuck you"", and within 2 years later, I'm 60 pounds heavier. Doesn't help that a bout of depression I'm still fighting made me eat my feelings. A lesson to you, and to all who are reading this: what your mother warned you about is REAL. Unless you are genetically blessed, your metabolism grinds to a screching halt around age 20-21. So watch your diet, ladies! Because aside from being fat, you're also going to feel like shit because being overweight, shocker, is seriously bad for your health! YMMV depending on genetics, lifestyle, and mental health as to how badly you will be impacted. Some people won't start getting impacted until they're 100 lbs over. Some, it only takes 20. The most important thing is to be HEALTHY, and comfortable in your own skin. That is always #1.   Oh, also, your tips rock, 10/10.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@yanaheemeryck9677,"I never usually comment but I feel like there are a few things you need to know about that I really love and appreciate about you! 1. Your humour makes it impossible to get bored of the video, usually when I watch youtube videos I scroll through the comments at the same time but the way you present yourself and the awesome content you make makes me unable to look at anything else! 2. The fact that you link everything you could find that’s used in you video is truly a gift from above! Show that you put so much effort in what you do and I love that! That also shows in how you edit your videos and things like that, which is probably the best and most fun I’ve ever seen! 3. Your way of combining clothing is very fresh and interesting to me, I have been looking for my own style for a while and your videos really give me the inspiration and gut I need to try out new styles and combinations! They make me see fashion as a fun hobby instead of a hassle!  Thank you so much for putting your amazing style and effort out there, please never stop doing what you’re doing!!
