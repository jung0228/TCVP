@SurnameName-q5c,"What really blows my mind is how little curiosity people have when it comes to manifestation and the deeper mechanics behind it. Most folks are satisfied with the recycled 'think positive and visualize' narrative — which, sure, has its place — but that’s just the surface. There’s a whole architecture of laws and principles underneath that most never even touch. The fact that so few have heard of Luna Rivers, someone who spent years decoding this hidden structure and laid it all out in Manifest the Unseen, says everything. People aren’t necessarily lacking potential — they’re just not willing to question beyond the obvious. And that comfort zone? It’s costing them their freedom.💰✨",1개월 전,195,

Prove to yourself, you have good things in life 3. Lower expectations, your happiness is not what you think it is. We know the meaning of something if we know the opposite of it (Happiness vs. sadness) 4. Be Convinced that people you see on social media are not happy as you think they are. 5.

@AnttiKivivalli,"There's no antifragile. The mind can get stronger, bigger, but it is still mind and can be fragile.  In Ananda Marga we say that the mind develops through ""clash and cohesion"", which is basically the same as the ""post traumatic growth"" mentioned in the video. But we (mostly) don't look for clash, physical or emotional, or trauma(!), but it comes naturally. And for us spirituality not just ""finding meaning and purpose"", but it is a practical thing, well explained in our philosophy. As ""spirit"" or ""consciousness"" is perfect in itself, spirituality essentially means the psycho-spiritual process or sadhana or tantrik meditation where we direct our mind inwards, towards consciousness. That results in a very profoundly healing, cohesive process, which at the same time incites more clashes or sources of unhappiness on our way! That also gives balance and perspective to the sources or happiness and unhappiness in our lives. And sadhana and helping others selflessly are the best way to make the mind stronger.",3년 전,3,

@canal000,"When one values the experience of  finding meaning above the experience of feeling happiness then one gets the most enjoyment from understanding problems and finding solutions, under these conditions the desire for happiness comes second. Also for attaining happiness one needs to stop wanting it, because if one wants something which by nature can only exists inside the mind (this doesn't mean that happiness can be created easily just by the mind) the process of wanting the experience will prevent you from ever getting the experience, because your mind is busy desiring instead of having.",3년 전(수정됨),1,

Other people definitely make the world more exciting, but the most important relationship you can work on is the one with yourself. This is done through a lifetime of introspection, constantly growing as a Being. The human mind will grow regardless of what you fill it with; it's your job to prune it into something beautiful. The first step in this is to be honest, not just silently, to yourself but out loud to others. When we stop lying to others, we stop being able to accept the things we put up as excuses, and change comes naturally at that point. If you are embarrassed revealing the truth, either embrace whatever it is or change your behavior. Simply put, live authentically.",3년 전,1,

@mauricioventanas,"I would refer to this as ""PTG training"" or ""antifragility training"". The idea is to grow your resilience and toughness by exposing yourself to progressive levels of trauma that you can handle in a relatively controlled environment. There are certain sports or physical activities which I think contribute to PTG, by being extremely challenging or demanding, even painful, without risking your health. Professional guidance and adequate physical preparation are fundamental, but there is a lot that comes from within yourself, which I think has a lot to do with your happiness skills.  The first one I can think of is rock climbing. You can start at a very easy level which almost everybody can try, but it always takes you to situations which appear impossible to overcome. Only by trying and trying again, defeating your frustration and improving yourself, you come to realize that you can actually do things that you thought were impossible.  Hiking and mountain-biking add some elements of risk. You can get injured for real and experience real pain. So it is especially important to be properly equipped and trained at your level. Being able to get back on the bike after a fall is as close as I can imagine to PTG. I should just insist this is not about being reckless. You really have to be disciplined to work at your level and avoid unnecessary risks that can hamper your progress.  Playing the guitar, as harmless as it is, can be quite frustrating and painful. Your fingers really hurt and the retribuition of playing well takes a lot of practice and patience.  You may come with similar explanations for other sports or activities, such as tennis or golf. From these examples it appears that the primary area of action is Physical, then Emotional. It's hard to imagine a connection with the other three, but there must be ways to work on those too.",3년 전,1,

Even unlearning to label them as negative is really key, because labeling as negative causes avoidance and pain. There are times when we can consciously decide that a given line of inner dialogue or self-representation is unproductive, and that's good for us, but there are other times when we reactively reject the examination of a state of inner turmoil or pain and if we only thought to investigate further, we might find it contained hidden gems — that it contains its own cure.",3년 전,1,

Worst case scenario you end becoming who wanted to be in a place where you shouldn't be.

@LegionStrucker83,To start with maybe just by learning the art of accepting your own reality and never listen to people trying to convince you about positive self speaking on a self manipulative and unrealistic way causing a part pf your individual humanity to be vaporized. Also stop the constant flow of new philosophy on how to achieve happiness that often lead to false happiness and a greater downfall. Happiness or the illusion of it is for many pure competition that causes such a ego driven lifestyle that the only way to achieving it is causing misery and suffering to others. To gain true resilience you need to live a life filled with so much suffering and pain that the bar for happiness is lowered and bestows you the ability to enjoy the smaller things in life. Mental capacity and human psycology is just as vast and endless as the universe with a abundance of unknown factors and possible skills if we could tune up the dormant parts of it.  Unlike our body my logic is telling me that the human brain is just to complex and not understood enough to be as easy to evolve as a muscle. Generations of war should have made us genetically evolve antifragility then but the truth we see is the total opposite.,10개월 전,0,

@pinkpastelstudio,"00:00 🤖 Painful emotions are a normal part of life, not something to be avoided or eliminated. 00:26 🎓 Antifragility is the concept of becoming stronger and more resilient through adversity, rather than just returning to the original state. 01:33 🌱 Post-traumatic growth refers to the phenomenon of people becoming stronger and more resilient after experiencing trauma or hardship. 02:36 🧠 Directly pursuing happiness can be counterproductive, but indirectly pursuing it through the SPIRE model (spiritual, physical, intellectual, relational, emotional) can lead to greater overall happiness. 04:38 🏃‍♀ The lack of recovery from stress, rather than stress itself, is the real problem and can be addressed through the SPIRE model. 05:36 💕 The quality of our relationships is a key factor in our ability to become antifragile and grow through hardship. 06:05 🙏 Cultivating the emotion of gratitude can help us appreciate the good in our lives and have more of it. 06:36 🌅 Happiness is a lifelong journey, not a destination, and we should have realistic expectations about what is possible.",9개월 전,0,

But after going through all those challenges, I’ve grown a lot. Now, even the most toxic colleagues can’t affect me or my work. Compared to how I used to be, I’ve become much stronger—an antifragile person.  I want to say to any student: challenges like dealing with toxic people may feel overwhelming at first, but they can help you grow stronger. Don’t let these situations break you—use them as opportunities to build resilience and become antifragile 🤗.",9개월 전,0,

@LodyBasha,"( And I did not create the Jinn and mankind except to worship Me )  (Quran, 51:56-58) Very simple! The purpose for man’s creation is to worship the Creator. The essence of Allah’s message through all of the prophets also was:    ( O mankind, worship Allah, you have no deity other than Him. )  (Quran, 7:59,65,73,85; Also 11:50,61,84; and 23:23,32).  Allah further states that He made this life in order to test man so that every person may be recompensed after death for what he has earned:  (  [He] who created death and life to test you [as to] which of you is best in deed - and He is the Exalted in Might, the Forgiving. )   (Quran, 67:2) But in order to worship Him, we have to know Him well otherwise we may form a distorted concept of Him and then go astray. In the Quran Allah tells mankind what He is and what He is not. For example, in response to a question about Allah that was posed to the Prophet Muhammad   Allah instructs Muhammad    to give the following reply:   ( Say (O Muhammad): He is Allah [Who is] One, Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, nor is there to Him any equivalent.  )   (Quran, 112)  And in another verse   ( “O my people! Truly, this life of the world is nothing but a (quick passing) enjoyment, and verily, the Hereafter that is the home that will remain forever."" )  Quran 40:39",11개월 전,0,

Now that I am a master of my mind, with a mindset totally committed to being of service to our magical gift of life,  I can tell you without an iota of doubt that there's absolutely no emotional pain.

@rajavijayach,"Summary / Notes:   Resilience 1.0 = when you put pressure on a system, after pressure is lifted, it comes back to its original position form  Anti-fragility = Resilience 2.0 ( If you put pressure on a system, when lifted, it grows bigger and stronger ) Eg: Muscular system when you workout  Anti-fragility on psychological level is called PTG means Post Traumatic Growth ( Opposite of PTSD which means post traumatic stress disorder )  Happiness is a good thing but valuing it as a only good thing is a problematic.  Happiness Paradox = People who make happiness as a goal, leads them to less happiness  It needs to be pursued indirectly through SPIRE MODEL to trigger anti fragile system and wholebeing   Spiritual = Finding a sense of meaning and purpose in life, at work and at home Physical = Being stress free and be able to recover from stress  Intellectual = Be curios and deeply engaging with material  Relational = Quality time with people we care about and who care about us Emotional = Embrace emotional and cultivate pleasurable ones ( it can be done through gratitude = when we appreciate the good in our life, we have more of it )  I do not believe things always happen for the best, but I believe we can make the best of what happens.",1년 전,1,

@dameanvil,"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  00:00 🌦️ Embracing painful emotions is an essential part of leading a happy life, as there are no individuals who never experience them. 01:02 💪 Antifragility, introduced by Nassim Taleb, is a concept that means a system grows stronger under pressure, unlike resilience which returns to its original state. 02:04 🌈 Pursuing happiness directly can lead to less happiness, but breaking it down into its components (SPIRE: Spiritual, Physical, Intellectual, Relational, Emotional) indirectly raises overall happiness levels. 04:08 🧘‍♀️ The SPIRE model encompasses spiritual, physical, intellectual, relational, and emotional well-being, which collectively contribute to happiness. 05:36 👥 Quality time spent with loved ones is the top predictor of happiness, and strong relationships enhance the likelihood of growing through hardship. 06:05 🙏 Cultivating gratitude is crucial for emotional well-being, as it leads to increased appreciation of the good in life and consequently, more happiness.",1년 전(수정됨),1,

@junemoonchild69,"Pursuing happines indirectly is still pursuing it! Happiness comes from LOVE, being in an unconditionally and reciprocally loving relationship with one other person (not family and not friends)...with this you will be happy without a doubt, right? Your only purpose or reason to be, is simply to live! Love provides everything else...it nurtures, it maintains, it moderates and balances, it creates and supports happiness for life. LOVE + LIFE. Also, no problem = no solution, and Love is never a problem. The only killer is being alone, for without a loving relationship, becoming anti-fragile is futile, to life and/or to happiness. The word ""anti"" means to fight against & the word ""fragility"" means being human, thus this concept is basically telling you to fight against being human! ❤ I hope this helps some who watch this video to understand that this whole anti-fragility and spire idea is essentially wrong, and just another convoluted solution to a problem that does not need to exist.

@tjd110,"The speaker introduces the idea that experiencing painful emotions is a natural part of life and an important aspect of happiness studies. They discuss antifragility, which refers to systems that grow stronger under pressure, such as muscles or post-traumatic growth. Pursuing happiness directly can lead to less happiness, so the speaker suggests an indirect approach by focusing on the SPIRE model: spiritual, physical, intellectual, relational, and emotional well-being. They emphasize the importance of finding meaning, managing stress, curiosity, quality relationships, and embracing both painful and pleasurable emotions. Happiness is seen as a lifelong journey where one learns to make the best of what happens.",2년 전,0,

@toystorybro,"@jeff-onedayatatime.2870 - wow this one hit home! My whole life as a child I developed the kind of resilience I thought was un-breakable. I always loved and respected the idea of being alone when I needed to. Then some months after a long term relationship I ended I stopped knowing how to be and do all of those things. One night at a concert it just hit me out of the blue. I don’t know what triggered it but it just hit right there and then. Suddenly I felt lonely, wanting the company of others not knowing how to be alone like I’ve been my entire life. Suddenly my forever positive and sophisticated perspective on life wasn’t enough to get me out of the deep. It hit so hard. Weeks later I’m now seeing this video and now this comment. So my problem was becoming anti fragile led me to forget my breakage would be particularly painful. It’s been weeks now but I’m finally healing. Understanding and getting there had a lot to do with me accepting that everyone will always have vulnerabilities. Even I, who always swore I could never have. It took a long time but sometimes admitting to yourself these things is key to healing. It’s okay to be vulnerable. It allows you to love and care for much more deeply!",1년 전,0,

I mean, he did not say that but images plus the title can say so much. And to me this touches a very deep confusion humans tend to have: How many of the people that display grandiosity of public acta and seem so calmand collectes at all circumstances are actually well balanced, fierce, strong and illuminated spirits and how many are simply a bunch of sociopaths playing to be gradious or even spiritual, by manipilating public opinion?

@mauriciogerhardt3209,"It always amazes me how the happiness ""specialists"" haven't cracked it yet, even though it's pretty easy: Your body has desires (desire to eat, to fuck, to be liked, to learn, to survive, to rest, etc). The desire creates tension in the form of emotions (hunger, anxiety, boredom, etc). Desiring something a lot gives your mind emotional pain. Satisfying the desire gives you pleasure/ happiness. Simple. Bonus knowledge: why do people who are desiring happiness become less happy? Because desire creates pain. Simple. Explaining: In order to be happy, one must satisfy the desire. If you desire to drink water, you'll only be happy after drinking the water. If you desire to be happy, it's as if you're telling yourself: I'm not happy now, but I'll be happy after I become happy, so I want to become happy. Do you see how this line of thought doesn't make one happy? It makes you believe you're unhappy, which makes you unhappy, it creates a desire, which makes you unhappy, and it doesn't give you any pratical possible step to achieve it. If you want water, you know you can just go get some water. But you can't just go get happiness. Happiness depends on satisfying a desire, but your desire is to be happy, so you're creatinga greater distance between yourself and happiness. It's like a horse that walks forward to get a carrot, but the carrot is hanging from a fishing pole that is connected to the horse's back. Every time it moves forward, the carrot moves forward. The more you desire happiness, the more pain you get, the more pain you get, the more you desire happiness, which makes you in greater pain, which makes you desire more, etc. Bonus bonus knowledge: Bhudda had already figured out this a long time ago. Desire is pain. Letting go of desire sets you free of pain: nirvana. That's why when you're meditating you're supposed to focus only on the present, so you don't focus on desiring things in the future. And if your mind wanders off into desiring something, you're not supposed to be angry at yourself. Because that's desiring to have perfect control, which gives you pain. Just relax and go back to focused attention again. Meditating lets you let go of a lot of accumulated desires. They'll go back to growing after you stop meditating, but while the're still low your mind and body can rest better.",2년 전,0,

@NAVYBrosky,"There is a false narrative that a happy life means being happy all the time. But in reality learning to embrace painful emotions is an important part of a happy life. And the study of painful emotions is an important part of the field of happiness studies.  Resilience 1.0 is when we put pressure on an system, that object goes back to it's original form. Antifragility takes this idea a step further: Resilience 2.0 is: you put pressure on a system it actually grows bigger, stronger. We see antifragile system all around us and within us. For example when we go to the gym we're putting pressure on our muscles, what happens as a result, we actually grow stronger.  On a psychological level you know what thats called? Post traumatic growth. So where post traumatic stress disorder PTSD is about breaking down, post traumatic growth is about growing stronger. As a result of pressure of stress.  We know from research that people who say to themselves: ""happiness is important for me, I want to pursue it.""   Those individuals actually end up being less happy. In fact, they're more likely to experience depression. Happiness is a good thing, but. Valuing it as a good thing is problematic. So what do we do? The way to solve this is to pursue happiness indirectly. Gratitude is the mother of all virtues, when we appreciate the goodness in our life we have more of it. Happiness is a life long journey and knowing that we can have realistic rather than unrealistic expectations about what is possible.  I do not think that things necessarily happen for the best. However, we can learn to make the best of things that happen.",2년 전,0,

Think about it, how much time do YOU spend thinking about other people, not much I believe, but you are thinking about yourself most of the time. That's it, everyone is thinking about themselves, not you.  2. Try setting goals for everyday, however small it is but make the goal a part of bigger picture. Like learning a new language, everyday set a small goal of learning about the language, watch content in that language, just small goals everyday. Consistency is better than intensity, doing a little everyday adds up.  Just my 2 cents and also become curious about new things and learn about them, keep yourself busy and you will stop thinking about other people.  Hope it helps, ✌️",2년 전,16,

@sendyardi5190,"Tal Ben-Shahar, a happiness studies teacher and author, discusses the concept of antifragility, which refers to the idea that some systems, both physical and psychological, can become stronger and more resilient when subjected to stress or pressure. He suggests that the study of happiness should focus on what conditions can be put in place to increase the likelihood of growing from hardship, and introduces the SPIRE model (spiritual, physical, intellectual, relational, and emotional well-being) as a way to trigger the antifragile system and promote happiness indirectly. He emphasizes that happiness is more than just pleasure and that it is a lifelong journey. He also suggests that embracing painful emotions and cultivating the emotion of gratitude are important for emotional well-being.",2년 전,0,

@danieljeftic6181,"Way too much emphasis is put on happiness........ It would be much better to concentrate on expectations......... Higher the expectations more likelihood that the a person will not be happy with life, or put it in more constructive way: more likely that the person will not be satisfied with life...... Instead of seeking happiness it might be more rewarding to look and attain the attitude of content...... To be content is something that can be attained within the mind, it is not external, unlike the happiness that almost in all its forms depends to external conditions, or the navigation of the external conditions........ One can be fragile and yet be content........ Fragility is a fertile ground for creativity.........

So pressure keep coming back as a circle, you'll become more resilient, but you will get hit harder and harder when the ball come back, and at the end plasticity is total, the ball does not bounce anymore, it is stuck at you, but you aren't much anymore. Your body and mind is deprecating and you get closer and closer from death. I have muscular pains, the more I train the more I do more the more the pain grows, which is the total opposite of your global conceptions, and how science and medicine explains thing. If I do nothing the pains grows slower, but it still grows no matter what. i would not trust anyone willing to teach how to reach happiness, especially as most of what the word covers is something that does not exists anywhere else than in our mind or the collective imaginary. It also translates one of the human pathology which is the willingness to possess or own something. But happiness can not be owned or reached as it is an illusion goal. There is no need to be happy. As it will be a fake emotion or feeling. It would just be a lie based on the animal part of the ego persuasion that you can own such thing, which is stupid because it is not something one can create. At best it is something that will eventually occur and be experimented but it will always be fake however true we feel we are.",2년 전,0,

This guy was a POW for something like 8 years and he had this to say: ""“I never doubted not only that I would get out, but also that I would prevail in the end and turn the experience into the defining event of my life, which, in retrospect, I would not trade.” While the story of survival and perserverence is impressive to say ""I'm glad I was a POW and suffered through torture"" is a bit troubling.",2년 전,10,

@kamest,You got this,2년 전,0,
@joshbrown2217," @nia2088  From my take, I think it's saying to not be afraid of doing hard things. (best summary is the last bit if it's TL:DR)  So like for the Spirtual part, he mentions having a purpose in the morning. While this can be something long term like build up a great career, it can also be small things like cleaning a bedroom and then watering some plants (so assigning yourself a task to build up some urgency). While doing this, you also have to consider the physical part, which he said was to do with stress. So when you take time off, you may still be worrying about things or that you're being productive. But what he is saying is to treat it like a productive thing and that you should treat it like a job in itself and actually completely try to de-stress.  by doing these steps you are breaking down the task's that you would view as hard or stressful (especially if you're depressed or neurodivergent) and learning how to break it down and not chase instant gratification, but learn how to enjoy and balance the stress of doing the task's you need to do.  It's essentially incorporating Frankl's logotherapy, where he suggests we all need a purpose, so instead of trying to find something that will make us happy, Frankl suggests we need something to work towards and that in turn what will bring us happiness. (But this builds upon it, by providing steps as to how to achieve this)",2년 전,14,

@lunamikx, @nofvckingangel_  At least keep it in line when it's on another YT videos (that isn't related to Kpop) since your Kpop comments are taking away the topic of discussion in this video.   It's fine if there is some comments about Kpop but don't make more comments about making it overtake the comment section. Example of this is on Panini's: La Campanella where people keep on commenting about BP and it's overtaking the appreciation about Panini's work which is saddening.  I hope that this would become a common etiquette for Kpop Fans to not overide on other videos that isn't about Kpop,2년 전(수정됨),22,

Muscles do grow when you destroy them with laborious efforts, but the new muscles individually aren't as strong as the old ones AND now they require a lot more resources to maintain. The system has gotten MORE fragile, not less.  You can malign the psychopath all you like, but they were born to a world that grinds humans into dust and they are simply an evolution of mankind that is harder to grind down. If humans want to become ""less fragile"" then they need to stop trying to dominate the world and learn how to co-exist with it - avoiding tests of their resilience not by finding more ways to attack it.",3년 전,0,

@thetruthexperiment,"Uh, most people are depressed because they don’t get the help they need to pursue careers that are fulfilling. Artists get treated like idiots 99.9% of the time. If we all had jobs we were good at, that was in service to others, or we were able to support ourselves with our artistic endeavors, and we weren’t afraid of being kicked out onto the street we would be as happy as anyone would expect to be. When people say they want to be happy they mean they want their lives to have meaning and they want a meaningful career. Obviously death of loved ones is awful. Obviously you get angry when things don’t go your way or there’s traffic, but when people say they want to be happy they aren’t talking about occasional unpleasant emotions. They want a meaningful life. That’s what people mean when they say I want to be happy. Painful emotions happen no matter what. But if you have purpose those feelings go away and everyone knows that. Artists need to be taken out of kindergarten and placed in a school that develops their artistry. I can carry on a meaningful conversation with physicists and I learned about all of that stuff on my own. School just robbed me of my time when I should have been studying art. Everyone saw that I was the best artist in my many schools. At 11 I was offered illustrations jobs. But instead they used my desire to draw against me and said I couldn’t do it until I was done with my math. So guess what. I didn’t do math and I didn’t do drawings anymore either because I couldn’t do the math, not because I didn’t understand it but because I couldn’t bring myself to waste my time solving nonsense problems. But since I wasn’t allowed to draw, I stopped. I’m a musician now because it’s too painful to make pictures. We have a sick society run by sociopaths. Depression comes from the people who took what you loved away from you when you were young. If this had been 300 years ago I would have been an apprentice, and I probably would have become great at math too. Depression isn’t your fault but unfortunately you have to deal with it on your own.

@mauricioventanas,"I think the sunlight analogy is almost perfect but there´s something missing. Even after you break up light into different colors, it can still damage your eyes if you look at it directly. So the key is, as explained in the presentation, to look at it indirectly. That is not looking at sun light directly, but looking at its reflection from other objects, which basically attenuates it. Then you can handle light even without splitting it into different colors. Splitting it into different colors, to study its composition in more detail, completes the analogy as a final step.  This might also provide some insight into the possibility of using controlled PSG to improve our resilience, toughness and ""antifragility"". Instead of exposing yourself to fully traumatic real-life events, you practice with some relatively challenging and moderately traumatic events, from which you know you can recover easily and grow. It appears to me that this controlled PTG taps mainly into the physical and emotional elements of the SPIRE model, but there could be ways to put ""PTG training"" in the other elements as well.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

Hapiness is where the enjoyment is and where the pain dosen't exist all the time, so u can't never be really happy untill u will stop to percevie pain. I say so cause it is what our brain is looking for, our nature is to reach the paradise, it dosen't matter if it is possible or not, deceive themselves thinking that hapiness is where pain exist is an illogical, ascientific and stupid thing to do. Thinking u have to expereince pain to gain hapiness would bring people to hurt them self and to not search real hapiness. I think people are not smart, saying such thing to the majority of people will bring social problems and a scientific slowdown to the scientific hapiness similar to the christian slowdown.

@lauramurman2642,"Hello Hello dear fellow mortals! A fruit (or anything else) doesn't taste better just because you've cut it into pieces. Paraphrasing Buddhist thought patterns:""...while you are saying/thinking that you enjoy something, you don''t possess the ability to enjoy it"". We, the humanimals praise and credit ourselves for being able to describe our thoughts and feelings in relation to our experiences, while loosing touch with that which we are describing. True happiness lies in experiencing something in a way that no words can even begin to describe. Words are the prison of feelings and emotions, an entrapment, disguised as freedom of expression. As soon as we say we are free, we've imprisoned ourselves. Animals are truly free, because they don't possess the ability to say that they are free. Take care and live well!👻❤",3년 전,0,

Like if you have PTSD and feel that fragility and overwhelming pain, please don’t blame yourself for not being more antifragile. I don’t think that’s what this video was saying, since anyone can cultivate these things, but as someone who as lived with PTSD myself, the last thing that is needed is more blame or guilt. Also, depression can make it very hard to do the things that make depression better-knowing that is also important. You are not weak or broken if you are struggling.",3년 전,2,

Yet again modern psychology forgets about the 2nd and the 3rd world. Does not take into account races, negative social impacts and so. To lead a happy life according to these 5 easy rules may seem easy for the priviledged ones but is unattainable for majority of the world so why even bother reading the book.

@ThisIsDownstate,"so what's the answer if you have just lost your most treasured relationship ? the relational one is difficult for sure. i don't have any problems in the other four areas, but missing my partner, my best friend, the future i thought was going to be shared with this person.....now its gone suddenly and not having many close friends leaves my mind in a bleak place. for me, now im nearly 40, its always been hardest to deal with the end of relationships. its always that someone leaves me. its difficult to not examine your self worth and just stay alone. but because i agree with him, i always try to keep myself open to meeting someone else, i think if you have a good relationship you can deal with the others a lot easier than feeling like its you against the world. If anyone else feels like this, it'll get better. This is the third time it came tumbling down for me, and the last two times i thought id be miserable forever, but one door closes and if you keep your head up you'll find another opening somewhere when you least expect it ! Its ok to embrace the low and shit times because they're unavoidable in life.

@Kkubey,"Of course, those who feel happy would not seek to find happiness, while those who recently faced hardships that broke them will seek it at all cost. This is why I think people who seek it will end up being less happy, naturally. If you never experienced something that was the complete opposite of happiness, you will never value it in the same way and find it natural.  In the same way, people get more curious if they feel more secure, and once they feel insecure or down, they won't be able to be open towards new experiences and learn in the same way. Also focusing on one thing deeply might be impossible for people in a bad mental situation. Also, those people tend to try to get away from others, as they feel overwhelmed by the social pressure of functioning. This is something temporary. In phases of life where you can live in a path you got to pave, you will grow, while if there is no secure path, you will just need to survive.  Basically, this goes about it the wrong way. It is showing symptoms of happiness as causes of happiness.",3년 전,1,

It’s just that even if it’s true that my parents could have done so much better—it doesn’t matter bec I’m the one that chooses my beliefs.

Not being in intense pain, having friends around me, living in a house and not homeless, being able to eat everyday, etc. There are people who were as sick as I was and they were homeless, in pain with no food. In turn, I couldn't assume they were completely  depressed and sad either because maybe they had a spark of hope, love and positivity inside of them that keeps them going.",2년 전,9,

@Telindra,"Always been told I'm so negative and having the wrong outlook on life. But yet, here I am, feeling rather content and grateful over plenty of things in my life.  Telling the brutal truth about a situation, isn't the same as being negative or feeling hopelessness and depression either. If one aspect of my life is currently shit, it is effing shit! Doesn't automatically mean that all of my life is shit, though. Quite the opposite.  I personally don't want to focus my efforts chasing something which won't happen anyway. I want to be smart, not foolish. I don't want to put all of my marbles in one bag. Like ""if I could just get to x, I'll be happy"". That's not realistic, and you risk missing out on all the great stuff that's all around you.   Now, to give some context. I do have worries, and feel emotional pain and sorrow on a weekly basis. Which is fine. As I won't let it dominate me, or take up a lot of my daily time. I discovered a few years ago, that you actually do have the ability to decide, that you're not a puppet forced to go along as I previously sort of thought. (Don't read too much into this. Clinical depression is definitely a serious and real condition. Sometimes outside help from professionals are needed). The lifestyle I love and cherish, got yanked right out from under my feet 1,5yrs ago. I'm now battling horrible postcovid symptoms, in a drawn out marathon war.  I haven't had the best of luck in my life, and carries a lot of luggage with me. Some which are PTSD, most of these are luckily closed chapters of my life now. The postcovid entered my life at the absolutely worst possible timing. Finances are also near, in ruins.  Long story short, there's a lot of hardship in the past, in the present and no doubt in the future. But I'm not depressed. I don't feel unhappy. I find reasons everyday to be grateful, despite the hardships. I honestly recon that I'll have a much better chance dealing with the postcovid, and the other pressing threats in my life, if I'm keeping a level head. Drawing strength from all the happy and grateful moments I experience, daily. I'm genuinely feeling mentally strong and sturdy. I guess antifragile is another word to describe that feeling.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

It's engaging. It keeps you very in the moment. It might be slightly foggy or cloudy that day. A bit of rain here and there. You just get lost In The moment, organically rolling with however things unfold and whether if you discover anything or not, you walk away from that day going (hey I lived in the moment) some days you find cooler things, some days you find nothing but you start to kinda find this in between Contentment. That's it's not JUST about if you find something cool, it's realizing that the act of just exploring and looking around and heightening your senses of observation and perception skills is honestly a great aspect of Life that can be transferred over into many other scenarios and situations and really increase the ability to find Contentment with in living.

@Nicoladen1,"The most dangerous lie one can believe is that of there being something to attain that would satisfy one for the rest of one's life. The moment you believe that lie you you create two common negative thought patterns: - I need to work to get something. Be that happiness or something material that you attribute happiness to. And.. - Happiness is something you find.  Happiness isn't anything you find or gain. It's a certain psycho-physiological state within you. But because you believe these two lies you have thus given control over that state to external factors. Suddenly everything around you determines your emotional state, your happiness. That's why you think a career or family or materialistic things will make you happy. But why shouldn't you be in charge of your own emotions? If you don't take back control, you'll run around in circles chasing after that one thing or achievement that'll finally make you happy. But nothing can make you happy but yourself. You're in charge of regulating your emotional states, if you decide to let your subconscious regulate it for you based on really stupid things you taught it to attribute it to, then well good luck. But none of this matters because neither good nor bad emotions are fundamentally good or bad. Just do whatever, but don't get stuck in lies and viscous cycles of stress and frustration. It doesn't have to be that way.",3년 전,0,
@Nicoladen1,"Are there good and bad rocks? Does the wave of an ocean look good or bad? Is life itself good or bad? It's whatever you tell yourself it is. That means, without your judgement, everything is fundamentally neutral. So if you experience something bad, it's on you. ""But rape and murder are obviously bad"". Well, in that case almost all living animals are pretty bad. Societal standards are not a base line for truth. They're our collective choice to judge things a certain way for no other reason than to create a common ground for us. So that we don't act like animals and function productively together. We limit ourselves for that purpose, not because anything is actually right or wrong. As such we're putting survival and comfort above truth. We live in an illusion. And yet we strive for truth. How are you gonna find truth if you're also the one judging truth from lie? You never can, unless you stop judging everything and start being open for everything. To do that you need to unlearn everything you think you know about life. Because it's all just taught to you by limited people that have obviously never found an answer to life's questions. But they're good at blindly believing things. Like religion, science, common sense, morals and societal standards. Do you have absolute proof that all of those are fundamentally real and true? Of course not, because any proof you have would be blind belief. And you know it. If you want truth, get rid of the lies you're believing. Not saying there's anything wrong with society or morals or having your own views and values. But it'd be a shame if you spent your life suffering and running in circles because you never see the illusionary nature of knowledge.",3년 전,0,

Well, we just covered that in the first paragraph: the meaning of life is to tell entropy to fuck off. Life is about caring. Because taking care of something is the opposite of entropy. First, we care for ourselves, because if you don't eat, sleep, take a shower, and brush your teeth, you won't be much of an entropy fighter. Then we can take care of others: family, friends, pets, strangers, our planet. That's where happiness resides. And we're allowed to take breaks. Please do. But don't give up until you have to.

The responsibility is on first the upbringing and conditioning of a child's mind (which growing up in a religious setting can help, but must be carefully balanced including a lot of secular teaching to give a person realistic expectations of God and the religion) and then second it is the responsibility of the individual who has grown up. God cannot provide such things.

@MrWaterbugdesign,"I'm a 65 year old American man. I agree. I've been pushing myself most of my life and have slowly been increasing the push throughout my life. I'm not sure if increasing the push is required to keep the benefits. I got on this path when I joined the US Army out of high school. I did it just to get money for college. Young dumb kid I didn't really think it was a big deal, and really it wasn't. But I saw how much it changed me, made me stronger in all ways. Stringer, not strong. So I just kind of kept looking for things, choices that made me more.  Now I look back on my life and wow, pretty intense imo. I retired at 45 but that just gave me more options. That didn't mean spending more money. For the past 15 years my total spend has averaged $600/mo. That's part of the path. What can I do without AND be happier.  I'm not sure ""happy"" is the correct term. Content might be better. Sometimes I do get so happy I do a little dance. Nothing particular, just realizing what a great life I've created for myself. You would not be impressed. Going for a 2 hour walk here in Phoenix, mid day, summer, 110F to buy groceries so carrying 20lbs of groceries 2.5 miles back home. I never carry water. And I love it. I do it nearly everyday. Insane? There's the rub. It's impossible I think to convey the concept. It has to be stumbled into maybe. Certainly living the path is the only way to understand it. And I assume maybe many people just aren't built for it.  Today I'm getting my central Phoenix ready to sell and I'll be moving to SE Asia. Can't say I'm looking forward to it. I love my house here in Phoenix. Virtually no mosquitoes, sunny nearly everyday, can walk everywhere. Very comfortable. But then I hated moving to Phoenix. That's the paradox. I learned how to be happy in Phoenix. Learning how to be happy is a great skill to have. I can be happy standing in line at the DMV.",3년 전,2,

@Mekinhumbel," @kaiserwilhelm3680  I had a pretty severe depression (although more situational than clinical I think), and what helped me to dig out was to realize most of my unhappiness was in focusing on what I lacked, rather than what I had. So, essentially, cultivating gratitude, but more than that, just a basic acceptance of what is--not that things can't change, but just that they can't be different in this very moment. On paper, it seems like it would make it worse, but accepting what is (i.e., more present), I wasn't focused on what was gone, or seemingly impossible, or on the unknowns of the future. Nothing had noticeably changed in my life except how I looked at it, but that changed everything. There is nothing wrong with right now. It is because what has happened has already  happened. There is nothing to worry about in the past because it can't be altered. There is nothing to worry about in the future either, because it's not here yet. You can plan things, but you can only actually do them right now. The kid sounds like a real blessing, but don't forget to give yourself what you need, too. If you  can afford it, and you haven't already, get some help from a therapist too, or even a psychiatrist if need be. And take inspiration from your son's natural curiosity and simple joy and allow yourself to emulate that as best you can. So much of it seems to be a matter of just getting out of your own head.",2년 전,4,
@lukasb728,"The problem with pursuing happiness is our understanding/interpretion of it. Mostly it is interpreted as a period of or even permanent euphoria.  But happiness isn't that.

It's always filled to the brim, one half is water, the other half is air. Might be nitpicky, but that's how I see it.  The fact a lot of people didn't or won't ever experience any trauma isn't inherently bad either, I don't wish the traumatic events I had to endure on anyone. I think it's a beautiful thing, and I'm thankful for it, that we're living in the safest and most comfortable period in human history (in the west at least). Sure, in periods of trauma, suffering etc. our brains work in top gear to figure out a solution, so it seems as if it was the surefire way for learning, but it isn't the only way.

@dualbrainr," @kaiserwilhelm3680 I hope you’re feeling better. This video doesn’t cover it and I’m surprised, but over the course of the last forty years I’ve been working on a hidden advantage that we all have but are not aware of. I’m talking about something beyond ‘anti-fragility. Did you know you have a second brain? Brought to light by Dr. Michael Gershon in 1996 it’s a brain located in sheaths of tissue that line the digestive tract. But it’s not a thinking brain it’s a feeling brain. And it can feel everything from your greatest joys to your deepest sorrows. It’s why you get those so called ‘gut feelings’. It’s also why we are able to power through things and go on to create positive outcomes. It’s the source of the drive we call our persistence or ‘grit’. I’ve developed a simple method where anyone can perceive this source by just doing one thing one time. The outcome is that it allows you to be more resilient to difficulties and that includes depression. I’m currently writing a book about it and I’m looking for beta readers to review the first chapter. Let me know if you’d like to take part in this project. All the best.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

No — not as a self-designated course, instead it flies under the radar in English classes, “social emotional learning”, even in math classes.

All this does is resurrect a racial hierarchy and breed a generation of apathetic black people and self-hating white people.   The left has a long history of racism (the Democrats opposed ending slavery, instituted Jim Crow laws and segregation, and pushed a welfare state structure that purposely broke up black families and led to abortions occurring in disproportionate numbers within black populations). This is just the latest in a long line of manipulation tactics to breed racial division.   And sorry, but the debate over LGBT issues is warranted. There is a major issue with people in positions of power over children abusing that power, and using their minority sexuality status to test the limits and excuse their behavior. Libs of TikTok and other outlets have  collating the evidence; eg. footage of men dressed in nothing more than a G-string twerking in front of kids and asking them to put dollar bills in their pantyline (this was in a bar with a neon sign saying “it’s not going to lick itself”). Also numerous videos of “Pride” parades in which kids are taught how to pole dance. THIS IS HAPPENING. And NO ONE can defend it. Yet somehow conservatives are the bad guys? Give me a fucking break.   And if you can’t see the problem with males competing in female sports, or making school bathrooms/changing rooms a free-for-all when these are semi-private spaces in which there is no CCTV and girls (potentially on their period) are in a state of undress, then you’re either stupid or you’re a predator.

@paperhats5201,"There are some points but isn't saying ""pursuit of happiness"" causes unhappiness a most basic example of confusing cause and effect? And it feels so weird to me that the emprical psychology based on questionnaires is bogged down with errors such as people being completely different and semantical tautologies (If you wake up with a purpose, you are happier. Really??). It just feels like creating an artificial fact for people to buy into. A lot of different psychology (psychoanalysis) also has that but at least it has a structure. Also it has to be said, I am sorry, but the idea of indirectly pursuing happiness for happiness is completely stupid. Again, I think structures are fine if not for all people, but these sort of videos just mostly repeat what is obvious and give information as a seasoning.  I am probably just confusing pop-psychology with academical psychology.",3년 전(수정됨),0,
@AslanW,"Aristotelian virtue ethics is by far the best approach there is to living a good life. Forming good and rational habits is the key in virtue ethics. That's what the virtues are; rationally acquired habits.   A lot of the things said in this video echo Aristotles ideas, mainly the thing towards the end about happiness being more than just pleasure, and true happiness being continuous. Aristotle, being Greek, used the word 'eudaimonia' to describe what most translators call 'happiness', although the best translation I've found is 'flourishing', based on the contents of Aristotles writings on eudaimonia.   I'd recommend anybody to learn more about Aristotles philosophy. If you're interested, let me know and I'll share some good material for you to check out.",3년 전,0,

Think of someone who strives for physical health because they’re out of shape, while people who are already fit might value other pursuits. You wouldn’t tell the unhealthy to stop pursuing healthiness because it’ll make them less healthy! (as long as they’re pursuing health in a healthy way, like exercising and eating well, and not in a toxic way, like eating disorders)  Similarly, we can’t conclude from his evidence that valuing happiness CAUSES you to become unhappy (unless the studies in question did something to explicitly test for causation).

Conditions for whole organism wellness > moment of pleasure, hence don't dive into a cocaine addiction trying to be happy, you can have ho-hum moments and be overall more whole than if you weren't taking care of yourself on all those levels  It could be a whole video talking about enduring through negative emotions and moments, and how and why that's helpful and more productive than suppressing it or trying to avoid the emotions you're already having. That's a confusing and non-obvious concept that was breezed over in one word as if everyone has been through 2 years of therapy to understand that. A good couple of minutes needed to be spent on the concept of gratitude as being the experience of relishing a good thing, rather than the Christian/religious  guilt festival of ""You better be grateful, you horrible piece of shit"" that got taught to me (and many others) as being the experience of gratitude--basically, that gratitude=guilt, and I can hardly think of something more destructive than guilt and shame.

How can you be happy, when you understand happiness as a ""goal"" to work towards? With this brilliant video you don't need to chase happiness anymore, but instead have to perfect five categories of your personal life in order to be happy.  Tal Ben-Shahar makes it look like you need to start working hard to receive happiness, while at the same time mentioning stressed and burned out people. This chasing after everything in life is in fact the very reason why people feel stressed and burned out. I think we need to stop categorising everything under a paradigm of productivity. We need to bring back magic into our lifes, things and feelings we cannot explain and don't want to. We should ""waste"" more time to do stupid things we want to do without thinking of efficiency or productivity.

And they who deny themselves and who they are, by that extension, can never reach the same degree of happiness as those who live with who they really are, even if it's sometimes very painful.  Having said that, I do very much agree with the initial premise on the video. Pain is a crucial part of life, as it is one of our core guidance systems. It is not supposed to be hailed as the only system by which you adhere to, but at the same time, it's supposed to be listened to and taken to account in the big picture of making personal decisions of all scales.  Contrasts like pain and pleasure compliment each other,. I have noticed this very acutely in my personal life, whether it's physical hardships like taking ice cold showers and working your ass off in a physical job while sleeping in the woods nearby, or dodging dangerous situations and having fear of death as your companion whenever you go to sleep all vulnerable out there. I only started to value living indoors more after living in the woods with only a hammock and some basic equipment to keep me from the elements. I started to value my money more after being in debt AND broke. I started to value my time more after working 12-hour night shifts with no real life outside work.  When you apply these kind of things to PSYCHE and SOUL though, it's different from applying them to some machine. Less streamlined and less straightforward. Peoples' psyches can be broken more easily than they think, at least that was the case with me, and I know stories like that. You need to give the person basic tools to help themselves with and allow them to help themselves when it's time for them to do that.  Also let me point an obvious simplification or fallacy if you will, that the guy in this video said: ""When we go to gym and lift weights, our muscles grow stronger."" You left a crucial core part out of that bro. The muscle growth actually happens when you rest and recover, because the muscle IS BEING BROKEN at the gym and you regenerate that afterwards with nutrition, relaxation and sleep, and you regenerate a bit extra because your body is intelligent and knows to prepare for that kinda ordeal because it has become a reality for it. But the crucial part is, you trust your body, listen to your body, and LET IT REST AND RECOVER, regenerate.  People. Don't just swallow anything this guy on the video or I or anyone else regurgitate, or even if a research paper claims it a scientific fact. DO YOUR OWN FIELD RESEARCH so you can't be fooled by anybody. That gives your worldviews a different kind of resilience, so you don't have to go from religion to atheism to agnosticism etc just to find out it's not really what fulfills you in a truly healthy way.",3년 전,0,

Joy is giving yourself to somebody else, or something else. And it's a kind of thing that is, in its subtlety and lowness, much more powerful than pleasure.

I am a happy person because I have a balance of hard challenging work as a nurse, work out 5 plus times per week, make sure to keep organized/clean and do “un-fun” things, because when you’ do these un fun things, it’s almost euphoric to just relax!

@jodoodlyboi2963,"I’m turning 20 this month, and over the last year or so I’ve come to realize that I honestly enjoy and find comfort in sadness. It’s the way you manage that sadness that makes a difference. Like reading a good book or watching a show or a movie that makes you cry. That feels good, right? That’s how I’ve started thinking of sadness from my every day life too.  I like and accept all emotions as long as they’re handled with care. Even happiness can be handled wrong and have a negative impact. For example, because you’re so happy you might ignore small issues that have been bothering you for a long time because at the time they don’t really impact you, and so you don’t bother to work on fixing any of it, which later might become a problem.  I think of it a bit like in Buddhism. Accepting one’s emotions and not trying to change them. Because if you constantly try to change how you feel you’ll just never feel satisfied, because constant happiness just isn’t possible. But enjoying, or at the very least getting content with other emotions as well is possible.  I’ve also found that it’s better to focus on physical changes you can make in life rather than emotional ones as those are changes you can actually control.  I can go on regular walks every week, and that may or may not make me feel happy, but either way it will get me in a better physical shape, and it is a form of change even if it isn’t an emotional one. Realizing and accepting that fact helps.   It also helps letting go of the image that sadness and anger etc are negative emotions. If someone is treating you unfairly anger is important. Crying is also not negative as it releases toxins.  So many times friends of mine might say “I’m crying” and my other friends respond with “nooo don’t cry” because sadness is seen as negative. However, I always say “good. Cry. Release those toxins” because rejecting sadness just makes it hurt more. It’s that feeling of hopelessness because you can’t change how you feel that often is the worst, so once you stop trying to change your emotions it immediately becomes a bit easier.   I’m obviously not saying to give up, but simply accept and welcome all emotions. Trying to push it away only causes strain.   Sorry for the rant lol. I just wanted to share my thoughts.",3년 전,155,

However, (and I’m not saying this is true to you) if your reaction to any mildly upsetting thing is to be sad for the rest of the day, that is not healthy. It is important to know how to feel your emotions and let them pass through you, rather than letting them drag you through a downward spiral. But overall, I do agree that sadness is necessary and it feels good to release your emotions by crying rather than keeping them stored inside you.",2년 전,4,

For those who worship one true god, and obey him will get his grave be open wide and cool inside.

You have no time or right to be happy when you have to finish highschool, college, job searching and work to retire and then leave a will to your family.

@apair4002,"Happiness is temporary, calmness and optimum health are everything. The key is just get rid of the problem. If you are obese, get into good BMI. Don't be Nicola Avocado. He is rich but not happy and sick. He build problem, health problem.  The simplest thing to do without spending money is your health. Go jog/run/cardio exercise, maintain good BMI, build up stamina, eat high nutritious food, get rid of sugar in drinks then you feels it. This is recovery process like in the video. Once you are married, if you not maintain good health, you will add more problem.  Stamina is very important during sex. If you don't have stamina obviously you are not living healthy lifestyle. 42% American are obese. Most of them got obese after marriage, no stamina, less sex drive and kaboom. This is the problem. Get rid of it.  First need to embed ideas into your head.  Give you all some tips.  1) Peoples are toxic, your colleagues are toxic, obviously you and your colleagues are rival, not a family or whatever. However don't be a deutchbag! Be kind, get your job done or better.  2) Getting family is responsibility, not a love story. This is very hard. You need to plan well in financial management, otherwise you are succumb into abyss. If you have a family, obviously you have a neighbour. Find a good neighbourhood or find house away not far from neighbour. Again be kind and responsible.  3) Get rid of problem. Maintain healthy lifestyle and live independantly. Don't expect your friends and family will treat you better. Been there, be in any group of friends, car club, hobbyist club, cycling club, in the office, you just only find many toxic and tantrum peoples. All of it just for socialize, nof more than that except the familiy you need to be responsible.

I chose to do this through hard exercise or labour but it can be done with anything difficult. Seeking suffering is also much easier than seeking things that aren't suffering and if you actulively look for suffering then you take a lot of the mental pain out if it as this is what you were looking for and you're using goal pursuit emotion instead of flight emotion which is much more intrinsically rewarding.",3년 전,3,

This pattern of thinking “happiness= a wast of time” eventually became automatic and, I would rather think sad, depressing thoughts than happy ones. I actually gave myself depression. Like, bad depression. Like 2 years into this and I was like “wait. I’m depressed. And I actually did this deliberately. Broooo. I’m an idiot” and laughed my ass off for like 20 mins.

Imma just think some happy thoughts again, even if I think they are delusional, and maybe I can balance out and forget this ever happened. And like 4 months later, that worked. So yeah.

@atriyakoller136," @MrJiggerG  the thing most older people don't understand is that advice, which wasn't asked for, is not always the best advice. My generation mostly learned to only give advice when we're asked for, and that is actually just kore respectful. Most people who come to others to complain mainly want to vent, and hearing advice can be difficult, because the advisers often don't have access to some details about the situation and give advice that can't be practically used because of that and because those details that the speaker may even have omitted may influence the effectiveness of that advice. If you want my take on it, from the people from the older generations I've spoken to, and I've spoken to quite a few, it was the easiest and even most useful (if we are talking about usefulness) to talk to those who didn't immediately give advice and just encouraged me to figure it out myself, unless I specifically asked for advice, and usually the good listeners had far better advice than people who started giving advice as soon as I said something, because they wanted to share their wisdom. I'm a teacher, and this principle is my motto: help, but only if I see students struggle, but it is far better to let students figure things out themselves. So, it's true about life too. As for upbringing, the ideal variant would be where parents set up some learning situations where making mistakes won't hurt the child, and discuss the situation afterwards. Not just ""teach them about life whenever possible"". So, my main point is that most older people need to learn to listen instead of interrupting because they have something to say. That ""something"" may very well change if they only finish listening. That's what a lot of people do and that is what deters younger people from listening to older people's advice, although usually good listeners win that respect later on",3년 전,8,

@TheJamesRedwood,"0:06 ""Psychopaths"" - or if we are going to be scientific - people with antisocial personality disorder, feel no empathy, but they do feel painful emotions. Hatred is one of them. Frustration is another. Ted Bundy started killing when he was in a depressive funk, his life was not meeting the heights his narcissism was telling him it should be. He did not kill unemotionally, he killed in a rage, expressing his own pain. John Wayne Gacy, on the other hand, seems to be more of a ""sociopath"" (still scientifically APD), his lack of empathy was created by his abusive upbringing. So he was killing as an outlet for suppressed childhood pain, even if he may have been fairly unemotional while he was doing it. So I am wondering if Ben-Shahar gets this basic psychological understanding wrong, should we trust his advice? His ideas here are actually very good, if largely unoriginal, so it is a repetition of good advice thousands of years old. In particular he has created a good model to express it. It is just frustrating that a Harvard psychologist would be so inaccurate in his introduction.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

Here is how I think you should be happy:  Be a master of your own brain, experience when you are happy and adjust it when you are not so that you are, when you are sad, remember that nothing really matters just like Rick showed Morty their dead bodies. And focus on gratitude and just do something that keeps you focused. Dont even think too much about ""being happy"" just do something that you like to do... You see, you cant really be sad if you dont have time to think about being sad.

The truth is that stress only results in positive growth when it is carefully curated and managed in controlled fashion, and the fact of the matter is that the vast majority of the stress we encounter isn't purely contrived. The only portion of this video I agree with is that happiness isn't something that can be sought with sole intention, and that people need genuine inspiration and motivation to accomplish something and happiness is a side effect of that achievement.

@apair4002," @colavfx_6530  Maybe its work for him but not for you. It is not simple as that. His background probably different from you.  Me just give you some little input about life, the reality.  Happiness is temporary, calmness and optimum health are everything. The key is just get rid of the problem. If you are obese, get into good BMI. Don't be Nicola Avocado. He is rich but not happy and sick. He build problem, health problem.  The simplest thing to do without spending money is your health. Go jog/run/cardio exercise, maintain good BMI, build up stamina, eat high nutritious food, get rid of sugar in drinks then you feels it. This is recovery process like in the video. Once you are married, if you not maintain good health, you will add more problem.  Stamina is very important during sex. If you don't have stamina obviously you are not living healthy lifestyle. 42% American are obese. Most of them got obese after marriage, no stamina, less sex drive and kaboom. This is the problem. Get rid of it.  First need to embed ideas into your head.  Give you all some tips.  1) Peoples are toxic, your colleagues are toxic, obviously you and your colleagues are rival, not a family or whatever. However don't be a deutchbag! Be kind, get your job done or better.  2) Getting family is responsibility, not a love story. This is very hard. You need to plan well in financial management, otherwise you are succumb into abyss. If you have a family, obviously you have a neighbour. Find a good neighbourhood or find house away not far from neighbour. Again be kind and responsible.  3) Get rid of problem. Maintain healthy lifestyle and live independantly. Don't expect your friends and family will treat you better. Been there, be in any group of friends, car club, hobbyist club, cycling club, in the office, you just only find many toxic and tantrum peoples. All of it just for socialize, nof more than that except the familiy you need to be responsible. Once again prioritize yourself, be responsible, knowledgeable, mature and be kind at the same time smart.  4) Buy thing for your need not for your want! Things like, watch, phone, gadjet, clothing, cars, motorcycle, etc. Saving money is a must.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

This is what Gurdjieff calls 'intentional suffering.'  This means you have through your purpose in life to go through the hard experience of discovering by yourself and first of all in yourself, the hardship you agree to embrace, the actual efficiency of your antifragility.  This means taking risks, facing death and/or madness itself, and never give up, never break balance, whatever you encounter.

The whole concept of right and wrong which are just value judgements based on our limited perception of reality, I like to think of them as lower and higher truths. That's where the whole 'Pursuit of Happiness' starts making less and less sense and becomes a lower truth when you enhance your perception.  Think about it, the concepts of happiness / sorrow ; pleasure / pain, exist in a relative world (which without doubt feel extremely real). But because when the scope of your happiness rises, so does the scope of sorrow, which means the happier you are, the more potential you have for sorrow (e.g. I bought my dream car and that makes the happiest i have ever been, but if some event were to take that car away from me, it would cause me immense suffering, may be even more than it made me happy).  So the idea is to keep enhancing your consciousness and perception and keep climbing from lower to higher truths until you transcend 'Happiness and Sorrow' or 'Pleasure and Pain'.",3년 전,0,

By expressing thanksgiving for the thing itself happening almost instantly that bad thing loses its negative effect on the psyche. The reason being the brain hears you express thanksgiving for that bad thing happening. It searches its database and remembers that when you say ""thank you"" it's because you received something good. Based on that pre-programming the brain then releases dopamine, the feel-good chemical that it is normally released when 'good' things happen to you. That's why the negative event no longer feels negative because the dopamine generated by you saying ""thank you"" neutralizes the negative emotion.",3년 전,1,

@exoressdelivers70," @bigthink  I found out this 'trick' when my daughter died suddenly. She was my only daughter and I couldn't shake the grief. I mourned for months and it was destroying my will to live.  Then I read a Bible verse (no I am not religious but in my despair I tried everything) that said ""For everything give God thanks"". I noticed it didn't have a condition that the thanks is to be given only when something you interpret as being good happened to you. Obviously it took an incredible amount of emotional courage to say ""Thank you God that my daughter is dead"" because I feared that saying those words would make me feel evil.  But when I finally had the courage to utter them my mourning almost instantly evaporated. At that point it was as if her death was no longer a big deal. I still remember her fondly but I no longer mourned her from that moment.

One thing I’ve seen highly functional people who are trying to maximize productivity and happiness do to increase gratitude is write three things they are thankful for every morning.

Artificial steroids that are used by a lot of gym rats are a regenerative hormone, anabolic hormone, which is a messenger in your body to tell you to regenerate more. That how they grow muscles. Of course they can use katabolic hormones too from a pill box to boost their raw power when they actually lift weights, but that would only enable them to break more of their muscle cells, and thus they'd need even more regenerative ooomph to make those muscles bigger and stronger, and would probably end up chugging even more anabolic hormones down their throat.

I also learned how to deal with my emotions on an almost (not master level but expert level). I began to see action reaction and consequence more clearly and I was more willing to put aside how I was viewd from the outside and more willing to show how I felt on the inside (being comfortable with how I felt). I can look back and see how some of my reactions to life were not because of how I felt but because of how I was trained to belive this is how I should feel. Acceptance of not just others but of yourself will allow you to relax and admire the universe and be more grateful. At least that is how I feel and it helps me realize there is alot to smile about.,3년 전,1,

Happiness is precisely what we should all be chasing, this planet has adequate space resources people and time for each individual on earth to be able to create the happiness they require this falls under the concept of the garden of Eden. The issue is when you have found your happiness and yet think because someone has presented you with a vision of their happiness  that you being to think the grass could be greener on the other side. this is the concept of the apple. In other words we do not find happiness because we are manipulated into thinking something else could make us happier, This manipulation is now coming directly from the civilisation we build for ourselves because the civilisation itself believes its existence is worth more and of greater value than the people who created it. this concept is the falling away of man from god.",3년 전,0,

I find the less that I specifically make time to validate myself, the more guilty, angry & confused I feel in life, for some reason we are taught that “victimizing ourselves” is bad, but I think suppressing your true emotions is just detrimental. The more I acknowledge how bad my life is at times, the more I am able to also focus on the happy things I do have, it took me a long time to understand that some people need that balance! Strictly focusing on the positives isn’t for everyone, especially when your basic needs can’t be met.

Life has its own worth regardless, and no one life is the same as another, so of course it's not helpful to compare and implement techniques or methods or schools of thought that were created by another for (and from) their own personal experience.

@waterbaqua5627,"I have to say the presentation was very dynamic and quite scientific, the problem is the subject in Question is out of the liminal, more or less an abstract concept...how can you tell someone about happiness who has never experienced it?  We keep showing images of what this abstract emotion is that's why its illusion is facing destruction and because people have associated therewith experience their dissolution.  I like the analogy of some physics and applying it to psychology which in turn makes these findings suitable to sustain this unsustainable illusion we are all supporting.  I personally believe and know that these traits we have been conditioned to work for are already there, we just corrupt them.  An infant isn't given 5 rubrics to follow in order to experience ""happiness"", they are in the moment enjoying the sight of new things, and evolving to try new things.  We've been conditioned to think that expeditions and achievement results ""happiness"" essentially we are looking at happiness as if it is an orgasm that we must manipulate so many conditions to achieve hence the enhancement ""pills"" because higher levels are always ""good""  People have forgotten their occult roots that's why science is the safety our brains are creating matter and changing condition, we cannot be masters of the universe if we cannot master ourselves, that's why it doesn't matter how deep into space we go, there will only be more rubbish to litter in space.  We need to change this egotistic view and make Mother Nature happy, even if you follow a ""SPIRE"" system it would be ignorant to not see that Mother Nature is hurting.   The most important thing to happiness is food 🥝 🥑, we are experiencing ""unhappiness"" and PTSD because we've locked up memory in our cells and Chakral regions...food can transform the whole being and it is vegan food because plants are the only ones storing this Solar force...so eating plant based regenerates the Solar force within and dispels the dark memories, there is a microbiome that is being wiped out by the rubbish displayed as quality food.  Even meat isn't bad it's just what they've fed the animals and the depressed state they endure locking their horrors within their cells and then the human consumes this in hopes to regenerate their life force.  There are also minerals, vital micronutrients that when the body is replenished of results in higher states that are incomparable to ""happiness""  But well done in presentation and clear concepts and execution of material... very nourishing for a student",3년 전,0,

@Danielle_1234,"Not off to a great start.  Psychopaths feel negative emotions like everyone else.  In fact there are studies showing they are angry far more often than the average person showing they experience more negative emotions.   The #1 occupation of psychopaths in the US is homeless alcoholic.  Different from the high functioning psychopath which thankfully is quite rare in comparison to the low functioning version.  People with schizoid personality disorder sometimes can't feel psychological pain in certain ways.  People with dissociative disorders sometimes can't feel psychological pain, but at the expense of not being able to feel the highs as well.  Then there is Enlightenment, which is the ability to remove the feeling of psychological pain for the rest of ones life by identifying pains unconscious cause and replacing that with different habits.  Enlightenment in many ways is the opposite of psychopathy because those replacement habits are virtuous, healthy habits that reduce harm to themselves and everyone else.

So there is no life without pain. What I would eventually argue is, that so called „enlightened people“ like the buddahs could be thought of as people above pain and pleasure.  but you have to be enlightened to know, i suppose.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

When you are subjected to an amount of stress you can't handle, you lose control of your life and you as a person break down. Are you really saying that losing control of your life and breaking down is how people will learn to be happy? Are you out of your mind? Traumatized people are listening to your message in disbelief. This is incredibly invalidating to them.  I have been traumatized. I overcame it. I know exactly what happiness is, and after what I've been through, trust you me that I know how to appreciate every little bit of happiness. But it's a fight, because trauma makes it extremely difficult for a person to appreciate anything at all. When you are focusing on protecting yourself, you can't enjoy life. It's not because I overcame my trauma that I forgot about it. It's like you are suggesting that I should have, that bouncing back deletes that experience from your videotape. I lost everything because of my trauma, and there is no getting it back, and nothing that can replace what I lost. I can't try to have children again, I am too old now to have children, I am too old to adopt, and at this point it is too much work to even try to adopt. And here you are, telling me that having had this experience, which has taken from me things I will never have a chance to have again, was good for me?  I overcame my trauma, but I still remember it. Yeah, maybe it made me stronger as a person. But the cost of that strength is much too great, it is not a fair deal. If I had the choice between being this strong person and erasing my trauma, I would give up being this strong person to erase that trauma, to get to rewind my life and not have to have that experience. What you are saying about trauma being some kind of useful experience without which people can't learn to be happy is the biggest steaming pile of bull crap I have ever heard.  Challenging people by exposing them to hardships that they have to work themselves through, hardships that they do have the resources to overcome and do not overwhelm them, is not the same as exposing them to trauma. Your little theory is an insult to traumatized people.  I've really had it with pop psychology meant to sell books just to laugh all the way to the bank, at the expense of people who are not okay. Listen to some of your colleagues, especially the ones specialized in trauma. They disagree with you, and they are right. Your time would be better spent trying to teach people to not selfishly abuse others just because they don't value empathy. But of course, there is no money to be made in that, is there?",3년 전,0,

@aishahshamsul8642," @doanale3344  We need to analyse the movie for my English class, so these are my interpretations.    - There was a scene where in blue memory ball Riley is sitting on a branch alone feeling sad because she lost the winning shot for her ice hockey team. And then her parents and teammates came and cheered her up, then she became happy as the memory ball turned golden (Sadness is a beacon; it signals our distress to others so they can help us)  - When Bing Bong lost his wagon in the abyss, Joy couldn't comfort him by saying it's not that bad, distracting him by tickling and forcing him to move on. Sadness on the other hand, sat down with him and got him to recall his adventures with Riley and validated how sad losing his only reminder of Riley is. Only then, after crying he could continue the journey. (Sadness is a core component of empathy - for us to be a good listener so others can vent to us and feel better. Also we need to make time for all our feelings, including Sadness. Avoiding our Sadness with distractions will only bottle it up inside and cause breakdowns/depression/lost of joy)  - Sadness caused Riley to act up in the movie, but in the end as Riley came home after her attempt to ran away, her relationship with her parents became stronger than ever. (Sadness strengthens relationships).  Perhaps you can tell these to your cousin 😉",3년 전,14,

@DanielFernandez-jv7jx,"I can also recommend the cultivation of equanimity and some degree of inner calm and silence in the midst of life. These will greatly turn down the volume of our emotional reactivity, most of which is negative. These will transform the positive emotions into calmer and subtler versions of themselves. The calmer and subtler feelings are the more deeply they penetrate, and will therefore have greater power to endure and transform our lives. Think of these subtler mind states as waves. The waves on the ocean that are of low amplitude are very long. The example of the longest ocean wave is the tsunami that can be of very small height, but is so long that when it reaches the shore, it overwhelms the coast because it keeps on coming. In the same way, a few moments of deep beauty experienced in calm and inner silence, say for example watching a sunrise, can continue to echo in your heart all day long. Such moments can be recollected and cause our inner beings to ring with deep well being. On the other hand, if you try recollecting a more raucous moment of happiness, the afterglow is weaker and brief.  The calm, equanimous and silent mind has a kind of superpower; it can absorb and integrate within itself vast amounts of beauty and meaning.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

What has changed is how i do what i do. Which has ""increased"" the amount of time i can ""tap in"" to that continuum"".  Like training for a job you love.  You start out happy but you don't know anything.  So, you experience quantifiable happiness in the form of, say, coffee before work. And that lasts 30 min. Then you go to work. Its new so its frustrating to not be doing it right at first. The learning process has its own kind of ""happiness"".  Then the next day and the next and the training becomes common knowledge.   Now not only are you happy for 30 minutes before work, but you feel happiness at work more often because learning the job, as frustrating as it was, affords HUGE SPANS of happiness due to practice.   Less stress because practice. Its honestly genius.  Anywho... So then the best part.  All the free time. Once you learn the dream job well, the happiness is doubled and the stress is reduced by half and the other half becomes positive stresses that actually encourage small growths of learning. Which increases the TIME happiness is able to be experienced.   Its a frequency.  A vibration. Like, its there all the time, its just knowing how to find it and use it wisely.",3년 전,0,

@iBRiDGE380,"The explanation to find happiness by breaking it down was unclear.  I've found that what happiness is requires one to see what is and decide if yes or no.  If yes? Then THAT is your happy.  Example; Wife chooses husband because happy with husband.  That said,  Wife gets angry husband keeps leaving shoes where she trips over them.  They argue. Both are unhappy. And wahlah. A choice. Do they divorce?  Ultimately the wife has to decide if the shoes are worth the entire marriage.  If the husband is smart, he's deciding the same thing.   They both decide the shoe argument is NOT worth the whole marriage.   Husband learns to put shoes where they are not a tripping hazard. And wife is thankful.  Where is the happiness in obedience?  Lets try this WITHOUT the husband ""complying"".  Wife decides to just pick up the shoes herself. There! Happiness!   But what about the wife being her husbands slave?  Ok. Scenerio 3 Wife and husband do nothing at all. Wife steps over shoes because she KNOWS they'll be in the way. Husband, on rare occasions, puts shoes neatly somewhere.  ...you see? Happiness.  Why? Because they CHOSE THE MARRIAGE WAS WHAT THEY WANTED.  If after the arguing and non compliance and slavery and ignoring all together AND STILL can't shake the unhappy feeling?   Choose another path. Say yes to something else.  Why? Because if you can't handle your spouse leaving shit laying around on occasion? Yer gonna likely have a crappy time with a million other things over the years.  There are people that like to keep things where they belong.  So divorce shoes everywhere guy and marry shoes go here guy.  Yes. That is happiness.  ""But what about sad ex husband?""  If he truly cared he woulda started putting his shoes away properly the first time his wife asked. Thats what a marriage is.  The shoes were being left in a dangerous spot causing her to trip.

Stoicism encourages us to understand that life is not always upward or downward. Life is wavy. And we should see every circumstance as an opportunity to get better... especially the difficult circumstances. Stoicism teaches us to focus only on the things we can control and stop worrying about things out of our control. Epictetus once said “Who, then, is the invincible human being? One who can be disconcerted by nothing that lies outside the sphere of choice because the more we value things that are out of our control, the less control we have.”  I think this goes in line with antifragility... which is about using difficult situations to get better.",3년 전(수정됨),9,

Have you noticed that what’s honorable for one, is not for others? Honor is subjective. Is it honorable to steal a loaf of bread to feed your family or is honorable not to steal someone’s hard work and let the family die?  Honestly…we know honesty and lying lies on a spectrum,  Everyone lies, even if it’s just a little.  So how do achieve 100% honesty? And how would you know you’re being 100% honest, 100% of the time? We know people are flawed thinkers and think highly of themselves, is that also not honest? And don’t get me started on that “I call it like I see it” bullshit….that’s a person just lying (being dishonest) with themselves and justify their bad behaviors. Courage (or lack of fear)…there is something developmentally wrong with a person if they don’t have a level of fear.  But have you noticed people are more talk? What happens when the bullets fly? Or someone bigger than kicks your ass? Or what if your child is dying of cancer? That child sitting in the NICU at a hospital, drawing their final breaths?  Fear my friend, is at the core of who we are. It drives us. It’s why liberals vote liberal and conservatives vote conservatives…fear.  Sorry, but stoicism is a pipe dream tough guys and pseudo-intellectuals like to talk about.  It is the ideal, like happiness, that so-called “stoics” strive to reach.  It IS an end goal.

@mylesfranco3545," @losttribe3001  That's just like, your opinion bro... But let me attempt to retort. yes, of course honesty is a spectrum but that does not mean we should not strive for the ""most good"" in any given situation. And when I say lack of fear, that is because fear makes us act instinctively which takes away our control. You do elude to this but this is exactly the point, it is not that we should not have fear but notice it, acknowledge but let control you because those who act in fear often act selfishly and are also easily manipulated. To be honest my very simplistic description of stoicism was directed at a specific comment. Usually I just consider virtue as an all encompassing term to describe what I know in my heart is good. Now its perfectly fine for you to believe that stoicism is just a fantasy, but that does not prevent me from being or striving to be a stoic. The way I look at it is as simple as this, if you want solid empirical evidence that a truly good person exists, be one.",3년 전,3,

@merlinsteindorf-elsner1150," @losttribe3001   Honor = Be true to YOUR values  Honesty = just be honest, simple.  If you don't want to negatively impact your life or hurt someone else with the truth, just think about the specific situation and evaluate whats more important.  Courage = reflect and reevaluate your behaviour and believes. break out of your comfort zone. stand up and fight for your values and what you think is right. it's not beeing not afraid, but despite fear doing what you think should be done. like in your example: holding the hand of the dying child and smiling, despite the fear  You can find the values of stoicism in many other beliefesystems too.  And of course it's an endgoal. Of course you will not complete some arbitary 100%. Thats because it's an way of life, something to strive for. To be better and make a better world.   Example from christianity would be Jesus. No one will be able to achieve this ideal of selflessness and kindness. No one expects you to be able to. But just people striving to be a little bit more like this, will make the world a better place. And you and your surroundings will be probably much happier.  I think most religions/philosphies just have a ""growth"" and/or ""let it go""-mindset  + maybe some explanation/definition of meaning/beeing  + maybe some behaviour rules  at the core?  Nihilism = let go + be yourself/free Existentialism = let go + be yourself/free Stoicism = let go + be yourself/free + apply growth Hedonism = let go + happieness is meaning Rationalism = just think about it and be better through it Relativism = it depends, but be nice Taoism = let go + be nice Buddhism = let go + growth + be nice Confucianism = growth + be nice Christianity = growth + be nice Islam = let go + be yourself/free + be nice Hinduism = be nice + let go Chinese folk religion = overlap with Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism Sikhism = let go + be nice   Spiritism = be nice + let go Judaism = growth + be nice ...  And if you boil that down the oversimplified answer is = 42! or  Let it go, it's ok to be yourself and happy and free, but try to think about it, be a bit better and be nice to others.

@Fapple," @mylesfranco3545  where is that definition from? Textbook and any Google search says the definition of stoicism is not that, but it’s  “1. the endurance of pain or hardship without the display of feelings and without complaint.” Which sounds like it’s saying don’t express or acknowledge your feelings. Which imo, when I faced grief of losing my mother to cancer, I actually experienced some people who tried to get me to be stoic but tbh it was very offensive and rude in memory of the love I had for my mother. I think stoicism is dehumanizing. We all have emotions and to pretend we don’t and stifle them is what stoicism aims to do, and I think it’s evil.",3년 전,4,
@mylesfranco3545,​ @Fapple  In that context I would have to agree with you 100%. However if you continue to study stoicism you will find that it not about never showing emotion but instead never allowing it to interfere with your competence and composure. To grieve and cry is natural and should be expressed at the appropriate time but one should also have the ability to cast all emotion aside when the necessity arises.,3년 전,2,

You will find happiness in small things because you are learning to be still and observant. You will find happiness in small things because your mind is becoming receptive. You will experience happiness in small things because you are being present to your current circumstances. Small things can carry great messages if you are attentive to them.'

Analogy of this video only works for painful emotions, not traumatic. Painful emotions could be compared to weights that a person needs to lift to get the “muscles” stronger. Traumatic emotions however feel like you have to lift tons of weight which causes your “muscles” to tear apart. It feels like a huge rock fell on top of you completely unexpectedly.

I see, a traumatised person can’t immediately access to this sort of self- soothing because I guess there are  psychological barriers that make it hard. A person needs to accept first, but resilience and bouncing back are in my opinion a part of healing too, although In a much later stage. I don’t think the video also was a step by step approach, but more a perspective to think about, something  that can be a helpful tool when  the right time comes. Of course traumatised people need therapy first but sometimes knowing that they will get out stronger, can help them to find a meaning in their life and help with the process of healing and continuing life",3년 전,5,

I’m not saying that a person who experienced such things can never find happiness again, all I’m saying is that we have to stop treating traumatic life events as opportunities for growth or some bs like that. It honestly reminds me of people with Stockholm’s syndrome. Sometimes trauma brings nothing but misery and pain and it should be treated as such and not as a miraculous moment of growth.

I guess when i share my past trauma with people it becomes “yeah well were all traumatized” or “that happened to me too” when in reality their experience was an event that made them feel bad. They were able to move on and grow because it was a weight they had to lift, not be crushed under. while I’ve accepted my trauma, theres not a day i live that it hasn’t affected me or my way of thinking. anyways, thank you for what you said",3년 전,2,
@007lutherking,"I'm sorry, but sounds like you're using your own experiences to rationalize your own situation and assuming you've been hurt more than anyone else who ""bounced back"" which is just wrong on so many levels. Its not about bouncing back, its not about going back to your earlier self. Its about using those experiences to become more than what you were, to use those experiences to increase your conscienceness, to gain more knowledge and insight and research into things that you don't understand, its not about coping, its about enduring and trying harder than your hardest to overcome.. overcome yourself that is. To think from several different perspectives. And it all basically boils down to how well you understand the concept of evil and malevolence, rational and irrational, how well you understand yourself, how well you understand your parents and your unbringing, how well you understand the broader society and the universe as a whole.

The thing about trauma is if you don't overcome it, it consumes you, or you it.. either way you'll end up becoming the transmitter of trauma.   Like for instance a lot of kids get cptsd from their narcissistic family system, these kids grow up identifying as victims and they're never taught to take responsibility but instead they seek convenience and sympathy and pity, they use victimhood as a tool to get what they want and that's bpd... others do the polar opposite and that's npd.  Both these types and other coping mechanism grow up to have kids of their own and repeat the cycle.   The cycle will go on. The only real loss is your own life and what could have been if only you didn't give up , if only you stopped being a fake even if it means destroying everything about you that makes you YOU. that's called psychological rebirth.

@Rithmy,"I think this perspective is important but i have to add that this is a view that comes from personality psychology. It is focused on traits and dispositions.  The SPIRE model does not tell us how to finde those parts. The emotional part for example. What exactly does it mean to also embrace painfull emotion? Many people with depressen tend to embrace sadness a bit too much, as the dvelve on past experiences of their life or on impossible futures they ought to get.  I believe there is more to it. Psychological flexibility is an important construct i got to know. This is a more cognitive and a more process orientated perspective to all that. I believe that the reasons why happiness is better to be searched indirectly are the self (ego) and the now. Pursuiing it directly puts a goal that is in the future and that can never be reached. Embracing a way of life that indirectly gives happiness will put you more in the ""now"".

Like you're just clinging to the idea ""this won't be forever"" whenever anything happens. If that's so, that's not a good way to live. Buddhism, which this video gets most of its philosophy from, teaches that clinging to the way thing are - attachment - and being averse to the way things are - detachment - are the two root causes of human suffering. It teaches of a way in between those two things - nonattachment - not clinging on, but not avoiding either. It symbolizes these three states as two hands clasped firmly together, two hands held at a distance, and finally, two hands placed gently together with palms open. Rather than clinging firmly to the nature of change and using that idea as an anchor, you should hold on loosely to that idea and allow it to let you live fully in every moment.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

Settling for a hard life usually follows with an obsession with pain/testing the limits of how much you can do. Struggling for a good life is a contradiction in a just society. Settling for an unjust society is enabled by settling for an unforgiving world, which is enabled by a mindset that fragility is a vice, and not a response to something that needs to change.

But we (mostly) don't look for clash, physical or emotional, or trauma(!), but it comes naturally. And for us spirituality not just ""finding meaning and purpose"", but it is a practical thing, well explained in our philosophy. As ""spirit"" or ""consciousness"" is perfect in itself, spirituality essentially means the psycho-spiritual process or sadhana or tantrik meditation where we direct our mind inwards, towards consciousness. That results in a very profoundly healing, cohesive process, which at the same time incites more clashes or sources of unhappiness on our way!

@mauricioventanas,"I would refer to this as ""PTG training"" or ""antifragility training"". The idea is to grow your resilience and toughness by exposing yourself to progressive levels of trauma that you can handle in a relatively controlled environment. There are certain sports or physical activities which I think contribute to PTG, by being extremely challenging or demanding, even painful, without risking your health. Professional guidance and adequate physical preparation are fundamental, but there is a lot that comes from within yourself, which I think has a lot to do with your happiness skills.  The first one I can think of is rock climbing. You can start at a very easy level which almost everybody can try, but it always takes you to situations which appear impossible to overcome. Only by trying and trying again, defeating your frustration and improving yourself, you come to realize that you can actually do things that you thought were impossible.  Hiking and mountain-biking add some elements of risk. You can get injured for real and experience real pain. So it is especially important to be properly equipped and trained at your level. Being able to get back on the bike after a fall is as close as I can imagine to PTG. I should just insist this is not about being reckless. You really have to be disciplined to work at your level and avoid unnecessary risks that can hamper your progress.  Playing the guitar, as harmless as it is, can be quite frustrating and painful. Your fingers really hurt and the retribuition of playing well takes a lot of practice and patience.  You may come with similar explanations for other sports or activities, such as tennis or golf. From these examples it appears that the primary area of action is Physical, then Emotional. It's hard to imagine a connection with the other three, but there must be ways to work on those too.",3년 전,1,

There are times when we can consciously decide that a given line of inner dialogue or self-representation is unproductive, and that's good for us, but there are other times when we reactively reject the examination of a state of inner turmoil or pain and if we only thought to investigate further, we might find it contained hidden gems — that it contains its own cure.",3년 전,1,

@oioi-yb9dw,"Live life as it comes upon you, do what you need to do and still to a routine to survive.  Pursue the most optimal routine for all of your goals and don't get attached.  Continue on your road towards your goals and don't look to past to long for things that are gone.   The past is gone and cannot be changed, the present is what will make the future a better time to be alive.   Grow through the challenges of existence, work and do everything as if you were already dead, as if everything had been already been lost.   Work as if your dreams are unattainable and work to achieve them all the same, work as if you had failed already and still worry more about becoming a better you rather than worrying about how you will deal with the future, deal with the present and focus on that.   Keep yourself as busy as possible and keep good relationships with people, hold yourself accountable for everything you do or don't.   Do more than it is necessary, it is never enough.   Work yourself to dead and pursue that which you want to achieve relentlessly never stopping.   Dedicate your present life to what you want your future to be, don't let yourself doubt about being able to achieve it or not, that's why you must work as if it was possible but expect nothing in return because it is already something you lost and can never get back.   This mindset will make you focus on becoming the person who could be X, even if attaining X is impossible now, this will make become the ideal you and if things do work out for you in the end then that will make it all the better.  Worst case scenario you end becoming who wanted to be in a place where you shouldn't be.  The logic is that when you are that person that should be at X place, then people will acknowledge you and society as well, at some point you will be able to reach out to X dream and make it a reality, because you already became the ideal person to make X a reality.",2년 전,0,

@LegionStrucker83,To start with maybe just by learning the art of accepting your own reality and never listen to people trying to convince you about positive self speaking on a self manipulative and unrealistic way causing a part pf your individual humanity to be vaporized. Also stop the constant flow of new philosophy on how to achieve happiness that often lead to false happiness and a greater downfall. Happiness or the illusion of it is for many pure competition that causes such a ego driven lifestyle that the only way to achieving it is causing misery and suffering to others. To gain true resilience you need to live a life filled with so much suffering and pain that the bar for happiness is lowered and bestows you the ability to enjoy the smaller things in life. Mental capacity and human psycology is just as vast and endless as the universe with a abundance of unknown factors and possible skills if we could tune up the dormant parts of it.  Unlike our body my logic is telling me that the human brain is just to complex and not understood enough to be as easy to evolve as a muscle. Generations of war should have made us genetically evolve antifragility then but the truth we see is the total opposite.,10개월 전,0,

@b-pos6022,"I think the opposite would just be hedonistic lifestyle (partying, sex, drugs, etc without looking for deeper meaning)",3년 전,1,
@Mistah_Green," @b-pos6022  That would make some sense, but I think it’s difficult to say whether there even is such a thing as ‘deeper meaning,’ and whether or not there is/isn’t any in said ‘hedonistic’ lifestyle. The search for meaning is deeply subjective and more a matter of faith and the metaphysical than something concrete and quantifiable. I would argue that one could also find meaning in a life of pure ecstasy and euphoria. Your conception of a life without pain and suffering may be one such as the one you described, but as human beings I believe our conception of what brings us grief would merely evolve, and take shape into something incomprehensible to us as we exist in our current reality.",3년 전,0,
@b-pos6022," @Mistah_Green  I’d like to rephrase, by ‘deeper meaning’ I don’t necessarily mean of spiritual/religious nature (although in my personal experience/opinion someone that is open to and has explored these concepts and respects their ancient existence is generally better off  mentally than reductionist/atheist thinkers).  What I mean instead is that there are traditions for a reason. We should work, love and discipline our kids, have a civic mindset all for the same reason, to better society and the future of our kind. I understand what you’re implying because while yes there’s no guidebook to how to live life and what is ultimately meaningful, it’s not a novelty that hedonistic lives are wrong in every aspect. Short term gratification leads to people ruining their lives, not just society. Ask anyone that’s lived that life if they’re happy they’ll tell you they’ve got a book-full of regrets. Our time on this planet is limited and if it’s spent pursuing shallow, self-pleasuring then you’ll quickly find out you’ll feel worse than when you started.  Having a purpose that is aligned with helping your family,community or country if not the whole world is the ultimate way of being fulfilled in life.",3년 전,1,
@Mistah_Green," @b-pos6022  I agree that one’s time on this Earth is spent wastefully if used only to lessen their own suffering and gratify their own desires. What I’m trying to articulate is that I believe that there may come a time when there isn’t a way for us to further the development of humankind in any meaningful way, and that it would be a matter of subjective opinion, how one would best lessen the suffering of all life. As for now, it is indeed clear that there is much to be done in the way of lessening suffering in this world.",3년 전,0,
@b-pos6022," @Mistah_Green  honestly if we ever get to the point where we can’t identify ways to lessen suffering then we as a species should be able to take a break and pat ourselves on the back😂 at that point I think it’s just maintenance of that utopia (through labour) because nothing good stays good without effort and maintaining meaningful relationships.

@willmercury," @oldnatty61  I'm afraid you're misunderstanding the concept. Anti-fragility means that certain systems require regular exposure to stress in order to grow stronger and achieve their full potential. Bone and muscle, for example, increase in strength and resilience by being exercised, that is, stressed. Bone becomes denser, muscles tear in working out but grow back stronger with increased mass and power. The same principle holds true psychologically, and is the foundation of cognitive behavioral therapy in which measured exposure to sources of emotional stress leads inevitably to greater resilience and psychological strength.",3년 전,9,

Suffering as a consequence of having a physical body (Sankhara-Dukkha): Old age, sickness, death  And these suffering comes from unending thirst (Tanha) of worldly pleasures/desires and Avijja/ignorance or misconception of the noble truths that caused Kilesa (defilement/darkness of the mind) which are:  1. Lobha (Greed, craving for more) 2. Dosa (Hate, wishing bad things happen to others) 3.

First of all, as a belief it’s false because suffering is a comparative term and comparative terms can’t be extended to everything. 'It’d be like saying everything is tall.' It really means something more like 'All is threatened by'.  Suffering now means something like ‘pain’ or ‘distress’ but that’s not really what the word originally (or etymologically) means. Suffering means ‘to undergo.’ To lose agency. So you can actually suffer joy — experience so much joy you lose control of yourself. (Pain is certainly one common way of losing agency — it’s very disruptive, usually preceded by damage — which is probably why our current sense of the word aligns more to that example.) So the Buddha isn’t saying 'everything is painful.'  Most of the Buddha’s metaphors aren’t pain metaphors they’re entrapment metaphors. Being fettered. Losing your freedom. Losing your agency.  The Buddha has famously said: 'Just like wherever you dip into the ocean it has one taste, the taste of salt, no matter where you dip into my teaching it has one taste, the taste of freedom.' So with this Truth he’s saying something more like: 'realize that all of your life is threatened with the loss of freedom, the loss of agency.'

(Pain is certainly one common way of losing agency — it’s very disruptive, usually preceded by damage — which is probably why our current sense of the word aligns more to that example.) So the Buddha isn’t saying 'everything is painful.'  Most of the Buddha’s metaphors aren’t pain metaphors they’re entrapment metaphors. Being fettered. Losing your freedom. Losing your agency.  The Buddha has famously said: 'Just like wherever you dip into the ocean it has one taste, the taste of salt, no matter where you dip into my teaching it has one taste, the taste of freedom.' So with this Truth he’s saying something more like: 'realize that all of your life is threatened with the loss of freedom, the loss of agency.'

To be alive is to experience loss, sadness happiness the whole thing and yet not be blown away by any of it like a kite in a storm. Extremely simple and yet very difficult to achieve because our lives are constantly bombarded with different ideas, opinions, beliefs with our body playing it own role with it’s ailments and effect of hormones. All of this ties up and creates the ego and makes us think we have our own desire. In a world of limited resources when we don’t achieve our expectations we feel sad. This concept has been repeated a million times with a million different examples for millennia.

@montacap,So did they put you on meds ? They told me when I was 14 just after mom and dad divorced after 30 years of a arranged marriage me eating out of a garden my lifetime then I ate out of boxes by that point I had already blocked out being raped at 8 by my brother had been diagnosed with a ulcer bad eyes and teeth and dyslexia. They put me on lithium I threw up . They put me on Prozac I got rage just random rage . I still had up my early 20s kept the memories blocked out . my the time they started I was newly married and had 2 kids . There was no time to deal . Now I am 44 and dealing with it and so many more of the other 3 rapes I blocked out. Life happened around me until now . I have 4 dogs and a lot of house plants which is remarkable because I by far did not get my dads green thumb . I kill plants always have . but now that I am seeing myself in them as I car for them I see a remarkable process . I check there growth what do the leaves look like so I can trim the dieing and keep it from putting resources into dieing and put it into the new and healthy . I am a part of its way of living and it is a part of mine I now see myself as a person and the house plant . I am accessing my leaves and taking out the dead so to help the full plant I am to build a beautiful plant with purples and greens that makes my eyes pop . I was just a little clipping a copy of a copy . That did not take root the first time so I had to cut a little further down and try again . Did that a few times then as I get worried about how short the original copy was getting . When I replanted this last time I said this will be all I can do if it does not grow being the best of the worst old life I will have to throw it out . I would be nothing then . I have no tools to move forward and nothing to go back to . But it took root now its growing healthy . Which means it TOOK ROOT . I am amazing . I am now divorced from all religion and do not fear the mighty pride fall . I talk about myself with recluse abandon . I SEE ME . I respect me and my choices also my actions . I respect my feelings and let myself have them then let them pass . Trauma sucks we spend a life time trying to fix what others did in a few minutes . My plants helped me see what I needed to be . Watchful but kind to me then others . Pride gives self respect if we are told pride is bad then WE ARE ALL BAD .,3년 전,5,

What gojiberry has sounds ideal, we do our own work but we can't do it alone. I'm glad for you that you've reached this point. Now my children are all grown, my dogs, garden and focussing on what interests me brings a lot of balance. When I have had counselling, the best advice I was given is to be kind to myself.

Only when you experience both extremities you understand what you need, what is valuable to you. For me it's family for other it wealth, I don't judge them cause they have their own referencing system. In your husband's case if he is happy with life at the moment, he have live it to the fullest with no regret.
