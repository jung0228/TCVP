@WayneRogersOutdoors,"Just FYI, it looks like these people scammed you guys. The island is not uninhabited. As a matter of fact, it is a tourist resort and a vacationers dream come true, kind of destination. If you watch this intro, the mistake they make is they have an aerial view of the island. It just so happened that I was also watching the island with Bear Grylls, Series 2, episode 7, and in his intro, he also does an aerial view of the island. It’s the same island. Now what this means is that we can research where series two of the island with Bear Grylls was filmed. This tells us that it was filmed at the Pearl Island chain off of the coast of Panama, the Pacific Ocean side. The specific island in this video is Isla Pedro Gonzalez and there is a village on the island of the same name. Home to a marina, hotel and resort and all kinds of really awesome and fun amenities including a resort called the Pearl Island Ritz reserve which offers luxury amenities to those who can afford it. If you watch the intro of this video and specifically the island with Bear Grylls series two episode seven you can see 1000% that it is the same island. as usual “survivallists“ turn out to be frauds.",9개월 전(수정됨),0,

Mr Google Pants Says: ible and are considered a delicacy on some islands. Some say the tail section with the coconut fat is the best part. Others say it tastes like a cooked spot prawn soaked in butter However, coconut crabs are endangered and intensive hunting has threatened their survival in some areas. In other regions, there are taboos that prohibit or limit hunting and consumption. For example, the coconut crab is legally protected under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act Coconut crabs aren't poisonous themselves, but they can become poisonous if they eat certain foods, like the sea mango, which is toxic to humans",11개월 전,0,

@joywalker4918,Okay so for people who are saying they have crabs Galore and could eat all they want this is what you have to understand the point of this was to learn how to survive in very hard and extreme situations so you're meant to fish for your food go after your food like snakes or other things with all those crabs crawling all over them in the bed and everything they're not really learning survival skills if they kill the crabs and eat them it's way too easy and they're not having to rely on one another to get food I don't understand how people didn't get that it should be common sense but I know sometimes it can be harder for people but literally this is about surviving when you don't have anything you can rely on no food or anything like that they would need it to be hard so they can fish out in the ocean or catch things on the island itself so they wouldn't be able to eat the crabs because you're not learning anything by doing that they're not truly surviving it would be too easy I hope this helps people to understand why they didn't eat the crabs..,1년 전,0,

@elusiveeskimo3013,"Why did you not see the crabs as a food option. Yes you can eat them, and you seemed to have plenty to collect at night for each following day. Sleeping during the hottest part of the day is the body's natural survival instinct in action, a good thing to listen to. It's amazing how much we can do when we know how to really listen. That shift felt after the first 24 hours was your bodies adjusting to the new environmental conditions you were in, to improve your chances of survival. If you had stayed there another week or more you would have noticed your senses adjusting to be more in tune with finding food and avoiding local dangers. We were meant to live as one with nature. Living in cities creates blocks to the natural connections we are born with. But with enough time in nature one can remove the blockages, re-awakened our connection to all things.",2년 전,0,

These crabs are held in high regard by cultural groups in their native regions, particularly in Hawaii and parts of Polynesia, who view them as a sacred and revered symbol. That’s why consuming it is often forbidden, as its life cycle is purely for protecting the environment and for cultural purposes.",2년 전,0,

@Jorunn1989,"It fully depends on the situation. In my survival training (including simulated aircraft crashes in different climates and landscapes) you need to take certain factors in to consideration e.g. weather, animals, tide fall, surrounding dangers (e.g.🔥) and source of water.   You should also spend the least amount of time hunting for any kind of animals for it will deplete your energy as well as increase your water need. You can survive 7-9 weeks with water only, no food. Only 5-7 days without water.   And no. You can absolutely not drink your urine 🤣 unless you want to dehydrate faster.  I would eat the crabs crawling over me though. Seems like the least hassle 🤣",2년 전,2,
@Jorunn1989," Dmangh  I recommend listening to WHO or similar organizations. Anything your kidneys filter out of your body winds up in your urine to be removed. By drinking urine, you are consuming these toxins that your body explicitly intended to remove. This can lead to kidney damage or disease as these organs need to work harder to handle the increased concentration of toxic substances. Drinking urine straight after drinking liquids makes no sense at all since toxins are there no matter what, especially if you're in s situation where there is no fresh water in hand",2년 전,0,
@Jorunn1989," Dmangh  btw this Bear Grills guy came to our country a couple of years ago and made a complete fool of himself.

I guess his brother has a little of that in him too but he isn't as motivated by the camera and footage as Nate clearly is but he still does drag his significant other into these situations that are not what I would call adventurous, they tend to be just scary and painful, but that's that southern bravado and what he calls getting out of your comfort zone but he has used that saying to death and it doesn't hold the same weight and motivation as it once did. Bottom line is pretty much anyone could have done the first 3 days obviously and I would say most people could do the first alone day as well as them, then just suffered for the next two, just like they did and in the end, I'm sorry but you really didn't learn anything new or take something away other than to say that ""YOU DID IT"", you suffered through and completed your task and you got it on film for the channel.

Along with him there was a woman with children who’s husband was stuck since he couldn’t cross the bridge. So my Ada had to not only help himself, but also the mother and her children. He also only drank coconuts as his water, so, you know, he didn’t feel well lol. But tbh I think his story is inspiring and I think it kinda relates to this video.

@HusniJabir,I have experience with tropical islands.  You can do this again if you identify how to improve it.  1. Learning to climb a coconut tree is more valuable than what most people think 2. Taste of the coconut water changes with the age of the coconut. Very young ones are slightly bitter while more matured ones are sweet. It gives variety for your taste buds. 3. Get a place with no crab holes and no coconut trees for shelter  4. De-husking dry coconut is easier with flat sharp tool than a pointy sharp tool 5. Missed to try other food sources. Fruits and crabs 6. Lack of carb rich foods gives you the headache. Train your body by avoiding carbohydrates for at least 7 days as a preparation. 7. Can make waterproof roof by weaving green coconut leaves,3년 전,0,

@colin-manyeates-clan5221,"A few things... Not a survivalist in any way but... Raised on a sailboat as a kid rationing water, collecting rain, fish coconuts... for 6 years... hmm I finally like fish again when I season it my way but there is no way I'm payin the high prices... GRRRR  So as others have stated ""EAT THE CRABS""!!! Make crab soup etc. for only 72hrs it may not be worth it but I always notice that seldom do these adventurists EXPLORE, ASSESS, PLAN. I think it is worthwhile to make fish capturing a primary. Either netting, or funneling into a small area etc. so you make it once and it fishes for you. Screw a hook when you can corral them into a pen. That is where the crabs come in.. bait, trap bait, trap...   Second, work at night and sleep during the day, dig down into the earth to keep cool. I really liked her idea of the slippery bottles to keep craps out but poorly executed!!! Again sleep during the day and work by fire light and smoke during the night. Gather in the dawn or dusk light and set up for working area and capture the crabs with fish bate... what do they want? Give it to them and that will keep them away too. I'm thinking of using the plastic slippery as a cliff kinda thing or a basket with a one way entry.    Yes good point to keeping cool, bath often and let the salt dry on the skin for better cooling and keeps the bugs away. Not sure where but find out a source of vitamin C ... taking lots of it keeps bugs away somewhat too.   What the hell do sand flees like what do they hate? Give em what they like over there and put what they hate over here. Sleep being essential it might be wise to take bug, fire, crab shifts so sleepers can sleep well. With four people it is easy rotation of 3 or 4 hrs. I like 3 hrs because everyone can do 3 hrs, and everyone gets 9hrs of solid sleep or 6hrs and 3hrs everyone working together.    As to the best coconut harvesting tool.. you were so close.. I was the climber in the family so no one had to worry I was awesome climber and as a small child I learned the best technique is to twist or spin the coconut till it breaks loose, So I'd make a pouch type of sticky or sharp spike grabber that would grab the coconut and then you spin it and it falls into your pouch or the ground. Knowing that coconuts are not round I'd take advantage of that fact. So lift spin and drop. Tons of coconuts.   Third Learn how to use a machete!!! When you cut ALWAYS cut diagonally with the grain... it will walk through it ... I can and do cut through 4inch branches in one slice... hit either away or towards the tree. Slice as close to sturdy tree as possible then put on solid ground spot and slice slice slice. I had two chain saws crap on me on a job so i used two machetes to take down three Pine trees, cut up into fire length and kindling. They were 12 inches, 9 inches and one was 15inches at the base. All cut up, stacked and done in about 5 hours.  Stay cool by keeping a bucket of water and soak shirt and hang around neck.   So hopefully this is helpful to anyone doing this or finding themselves in survival situation. Oh the right edge on the machete is essential and the longer the better!! Use the wrist at the end of the swing like a trebuchet action, less energy way more power and then add technique stated above and life is good, work is easy and survival becomes thriving.  For me  1. Water and water collection!!  2. traps for whatever may be edible or pesky 3. shelter - again personally I go into the ground and cover, both in really cold and really hot. I stayed a few nights in a home built in the sand with bamboo holding the sand at different levels. Truly amazing, simple and protected, sturdy and the roof could catch the breeze and funnel it. 4. fire... I put it last because once you have one you have to feed it all the time... screw that, .. either learn to get really good at starting a fire (ummmm glass bottles to magnify??) or again dig a ditch to hold the heat and keep a small fire or just ambers to start one with or rocks etc anything to keep the heat in and can be used to keep warm if someone gets chills due to rain, loss of energy etc.    If I were to bring one thing it would have to be netting as in keep all bugs out netting!!!! Other than a machete of course!!   Great stuff and so glad to see others live real life every now and then... it is ""altering"" experience and I think everyone should be required to do such before graduating from HS, instead of ""Spring break"" of debauchery, better to learn life skills.   BTW, When God Blessed you with rain, give thanks were thanks is justified. Remember God made the entire universe and then one tiny stable sun with planets and one special one with a moon that has a rotation, on a tilted axis and magnetic field and WATER... I think a little appreciation is warranted. It makes a difference too.  Science has shown that if one, just one little thing, distance from the sun, size of the sun, tilt of the axis, no magnetic field, moon smaller, larger, closer, further away, rotation speed, every little thing altered one teeny tiny bit and we would not exist... hmmm pretty awesome eh??

@brattrox2939,"Coffee makes you pee but isn't a huge dehydration risk as long as you aren't drinking a bunch of it. It also reduces inflammation so it should help with headaches to a degree (like a slower and shorter lasting aspirin) and a short burst of energy (and my personal favorite, it changes up the food and drinks a bit so food is less boring because personally for me a limited diet in itself drains me of energy).  Also I was glad to see that someone as pale as me could actually be very useful at night, I could just catch and kill and cook crabs and smoke out sand flies so everyone could sleep and eat in the morning. And then I could wake up in the shade in the afternoon and keep spirits high with made up games and humor. Also I could craft String or something.

And fastened a raft out of bamboo, palm fronds & braided bark, then attach it to 2 large rocks or trees several feet/yards apart & floated in the very shallow water as a bed. Not the most comfortable, but I guarantee it’s better than the nightly sand fly & crab invasion! You could also add the plastic bottles under the raft for extra flotation which will help add stability & keep you dry…plus, it’s like sleeping on a water bed, just more literal 😜 If sleeping on a raft in shallow water doesn’t sound appealing (or you don’t have the time or energy to make it) you could use the trash bottles (& maybe a little braided bark as rope) to create an elevated bed. And if you’re concerned about the water, you could also filter the rain water through sand to help clean any bad tree/leaf residue & impurities from the trash you used to collect/store it. (or put the water in your coconut bowls & hang them over your fire to help purify it a bit) *Btw, I am NOT a survivalist by any means, nor will I ever pretend to be one, I’m just speaking from my own experiences with minimalist camping over the past 35+ years.",3년 전,6,

@kalevipoeg6916,"I do enjoy survival situations  - though if I may....72 hours with no food or (fresh) water on an island with a shady spot under some trees is not really surviving anything, simply because...well...you can live without any food or water at all for 72 hours and be just fine. I know because I've done it - I've gone nearly 2 weeks without food and 4 days without water before (I was REALLY hungry after the first few days, then I hit a period where my stomach got USED to being empty and I wasn't bothered by it so much and a bit of water here and there was enough - it was only after week 1 that I started to run into dizzy spells standing up and feeling pretty weak by day 10 and 11). You'd be pretty dehydrated, for sure, and a bit hungry yes but there's very little risk of actually dying within that time period if you went INTO the situation reasonably well fed and hydrated (which I'm sure you would have). This is more like a camping trip where you forgot to take food and water. It'd suck but it'd be fine as long as you got water in  you before day 5. Technically you can live for a MONTH without any food though by week 3 you'd be so weak you'd be barely able to get up and walk around, which is where the danger comes in.   Anyway my point is, 10 days to 2 weeks would be a survival situation since you CAN die from lack of water in that time (not food though) and anything over 3 weeks becomes a serious survival situation without food.

Sure its easy in retrospect and sitting at home watching but unless you actually lived it you have no idea how your brain would function in a survival scenario.

@AllyssaButhmann,"I cried a few times watching this video. It wasn’t because I have been marooned on an island. I cried because the way you described being without food and water, the lack of energy, is how I felt when I was hospitalized with COVID. For 10 days, I couldn’t walk the 12 feet, from my bed, to the bathroom, until about four days before I was discharged. I wasn’t hungry, during my COVID stint, because my body was in complete survival mode, and I thought I was going to vomit every little thing I ate back up. I was so exhausted that I was more scared to lose energy from vomiting than I was to starve potentially to death. The nurse and my family finally convinced me if I didn’t eat, I would be forced to, and I wouldn’t like the way it would happen. Later, I was clued in that I was about an hour away from a feeding tube being shoved up my nose, and into my stomach. I was so sick. I have had some close calls, with almost dying, but COVID was the closest! I could totally relate to what you went through, in a different way than what you did.",3년 전,0,

@roseyk7677,"They failed their own challenge by bending the rules with the fish hook. He said he was starving, but what really happened was that his own threshold let him down, and, he knew he had a lifeline that sadly did not allow him to even attempt to test his own reserve.   Had he pushed through, he would have realised that human beings are much more resilient!!  He would be the worst person to be truly stranded with, because he has shown that he has no will power. Imagine if he was in a real life deserted situation for days, or even a week!! Would he truly want to survive, or would he give up? I think the latter is his personality. I would not want him on my team.   ""I'm starving""  He doesn't know what starving is. All he did was hit his own brick wall limit and failed to test himself further.... This was not a challenge, it was a guy and his privileged friends playing at castaway with no real authenticity.  I watched it yo be inspired by people who wanted to experience real life scenarios... What an opportunity they missed by not following this challenge through with genuine actions.  Think they'll regret that in the future!!

@sonofeloah," @Joshstix95 : See, one of the first things I would do upon landing there is to scout out and find the trash. Sad it is there, it is everywhere, but it does have great survival uses. First thing is to clean and use plastic to set up a solar fresh water distillation system. Next, sort all plastic I could turn into shingles. Some for cordage. Storage. The shingles along with the hybiscus bark cordage and a rain proof roof and side walls would have been a priority. Use palm fronds to weave walls, bed mats, and a door. This would minimize and even eleminate the invasion of the crabs and the flies. And no shelter under any trees that can drop heavy objects on me and or my shelter. But the plastic distillation for fresh water and shingles to keep the rain and critters off are two ways to quick use plastic waste.",3년 전(수정됨),5,

Also swim near the rocks there might have been crabs and lobster?   I hope at 2am you collected more rain water?   Sleep deprivation is terrible😭. Wait until you have kids/babies, and if unlucky, sick kids..from birth, my first was sick 5.5yrs, my second 1yr. I didn't sleep longer than 20mins in one go for 3mths and the first 5.5yrs never longer than 1.5hrs in one go.. Half the night awake with my child during those years.. And still doing housework and part time job in the day.. You survive like a zombie...immune system dies.. You get everything your kids get.. And they get approx 8-12 infections a year when small. After 10yrs of this I got burnout, depression, PTSD, and insomnia and am still in therapy.. Crazy.  Maybe you guys should have slept more in the day and slept in shifts at night.

@Sigurther," @narcissticgoddess  ah, figures. That sounds like an incredible cop-out, to be honest. I suspect they didnt do it because it would've detracted from the drama, given there were no other restrictions on them. As others have pointed out, it was as easy as poking them with a stick, putting them on the fire and eating them. You don't need special tools and any calories are calories. Probably a hell of a lot less energy costly than breaking open a coconut. Regardless, I watched the whole thing.   The most annoying thing about this was the caffeine addict wasting her one tool on a bag of coffee. Dumb. Really, really dumb. A waste of water, dehydrates you, difficult to make in the circumstances, and lasts only until you use it all. Again tho, I suspect this was done for dramatic effect only, a key point to why 'survival' shows are more scripting than actual survival.",3년 전,20,

@joywalker4918,​ @kerronpierre971 LOL of course they knew they could eat the crabs but this was meant to be really hard so they didn't want them catching food that was coming right up to them out of the ocean they were meant to catch their food which means they wouldn't be able to eat the crab they would need to catch their food in the ocean they could eat snakes and things like that but not a bunch of crabs that walked right up to them because that's too easy they're meant to go after stuff that is hard I don't understand how y'all didn't get that..,1년 전(수정됨),0,
@joywalker4918,​ @banheesos no they weren't meant to eat the crabs because it was meant to be really hard they were only supposed to go after the food that they could catch like maybe a snake or what ever they caught in the ocean not food that literally walks up to them it's meant to be extremely hard for them to get their food they're trying to learn survival skills and that means you don't eat a bunch of crabs that come up to you like that is too easy I don't understand how y'all didn't understand that it's like y'all didn't really watch the video or something because they literally were told to do it the hard way not the easy way and just catch all the crabs that crawled all over them at night that's just way too easy and you're not really learning how to survive..,1년 전(수정됨),0,

@ChristopherSloane,Eh collection water off of tree or under them is a bad idea. All th3e bird and insect poop and what not washes off and well you are drinking it. You have to get the rain water in a clear area. Surprised you guys were not fishing and using the ocean for food. The crabs could have been a food source as well.,3년 전(수정됨),3,
@Banquet-q7g,"The sun and moon are super moons and super suns every day. The moon is spinning. Because of Nibiru.  - 예슈아커밍 / Yeshua Coming -  Dear brothers and sisters, I am greeting you in the name of Yeshua. My name is Seon Ha.  How many facts do you know?  First, super moon and super sun rise every day. Second, the moon rotates every day. Third, clouds are gradually coming down to the sky. Fourth, when the sun rises and the sun rises, there is a pink glow in the sky.  The media never answers the question, but I will tell you. The answer to all these questions is because Nibiru is coming.  Almighty God continued to show me the vision that Nibiru is coming from 2017. Nibiru is a sun-like being, a system. It is said that there are red and white planets in it. I am neither a scientist nor an astronomer with an astronomical telescope, but I am explaining it with the vision of the Creator Yahweh God.  Nibiru location is behind the sun right now according vision from Yahweh Father. So, due to the presence of two lights, the is spinning all night. If you observe it from sunrise to sunset overnight, the moon is rotating more than 90 degrees. This is because Nibiru is approaching.  Every day a super moon comes up, and every day a super sun rises, but the media never tells you the right answer. That's because Nibiru's location is now behind the sun. Nibiru is as like the sun. It has its own light. Super moons and super suns are showing big close to 15% to 30%.   When the sun rises and you can see the pink sky, because there is the red planet in Nibiru. In time, the sky around the world will be completely dark pink, and even the air will look purple. By that time, you will know. How much the time Yeshua came for the rapture so close, how imminent the rapture is, everyone in the world will see for themselves if they have eyes to see.  Clouds in the sky are gradually coming down to the ground. August 16, 2010, God explained when the rapture time line is through the vision. When the clouds come down to the ground, when the clouds come down to the height of the tree, the globe will be completely crushed and distorted. No one in the world knows when that will be, but God's sons, daughters, Yeshua's brides, and the chosen ones who have your name written in the book of life should know.  Yeshua is coming soon. Prepare for the rapture. Shalom.",3년 전,0,

@erikstephens34,Fun video.  I personally have quite a bit of experience with fasting.  I'm currently on an OMAD diet (one meal a day).  And haver personally done fasts over 100 hours (4 days).   Water is critical.  Food is not.  When in a fasted state I often have more energy.  There is a huge difference between a fasted state and a starvation state.   Having limited food throughout the day works your digestive system (breaks a fast) and puts you into a state of starvation and that might be worse than eating nothing at all.   It would be better to save your food for one larger meal than eating not enough through the day.   When in a fasted state your digestive system goes dormant and your body prioritizes energy for acquiring food and critical thinking.   I'm most energetic and clear when in a fasted state.   It often takes me 8 to 12 hours of no calories to enter a fasted state.   Of note dehydration is bad all around and water is very important for your body to convert fat to glucose to make energy.,3년 전,0,
