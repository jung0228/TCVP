When do i know i am ready to even start studying the head? There are so many things that i want to draw well. But the head is easily the most important thing to get right. Whether its an full Body illustration or just a simple portrait. I am atm focusing on volumatric shapes, basic shapes and perspective. But my end goal is to draw people and faces is what i want to learn first because there is so much that goes into drawing a face. Would love some guiding steps in what to approach first.

@somerandomfatguy.3384,If you are reading this now and you are beginner artist who doesn't have very good pencil control it's is adviced to them to stop watching this videos in the intention of learning the theory to master this practice as it will be both futile and waste of time for them... Instade they are stressed to go back and practice the fundamentals such as lines and gradually progress to learn to draw box and other primitive shapes and then some fundamental perspective for general necessary as prerequisites then they are welcome to partake on this course with learning intention because Loomis methode will use perspective intuitively and it's my understanding that students are better off if they understand the theory rather than brute force their self to replicate these images and miss the purpose of practice all together.. So good luck.,3년 전(수정됨),0,

@Lycius,"Noice! I promote Loomis to everyone who asks me how to draw things, how to communicate visually. Everyone has their own expressions, but Loomis had it down to a science. Others before, had some ideas on it, but, I definitely refer to them for these. It's like learning a new language, because to diminish it to anything less than the effort and time it takes, would be lying.   I've worked at WB, Sony, MS, as an environment artist, about to start my next gig at TLM.   Loomis, you master that, it's a great starter, or finisher, depending on if you want to apply  your own signature style to it, but when it comes to fundamental measurements, can't go wrong, this route.   Hybrid of this? Jim Lee, cofounder of Image comics, redefined comic-book imagery for a generation. That's not hyperbole, it's what happened. He had a pHD in psychiatry before returning to his first love of comicbook art. The ""What if?"" on Disney+? That was what they did in the 80's, and they'd interview their artists, ""How'd you do this!""   He cheated. Well... not exactly. In art, you're recreating or making new ideas. He was clever, inventive, took newspaper clippings, and traced over them. The measurement and proportion rules for figure drawing all still applied, but fast-track, just recreate it directly, and enhance at will.",3년 전,1,

Cuando ente a la universidad, en Diseño Gráfico; me encontré a demás personas con la habilidad y que incluso eran mejores que yo. Poco a poco la universidad y el que hubiera personas mejores que yo me hizo sentir un poco presionado para dibujar. Dejé de disfrutar el proceso como antes lo hacía y me estresaba. Poco a poco me he ido alejando del dibujo, y ya no lo veo como algo en lo que soy bueno y que me puede dar de comer, sino como algo que sé hacer y ocasionalmente lo hago.   Ayer me salió en videos recomendados uno de tus videos y he estado viendo algunos. Realmente son muy buenos e interesantes, me dejan muy buen sabor de boca y la iniciativa de volver a dibujar como antes. Algo que me detenia también era el hecho de seguir un estilo o lo complicado que son algunas cosas para mí. O lo màs grande, mi falta de práctica.

@marriedaprince1,"this is so great- I am pretty much ""self taught"" as a pencil artist, and have mostly just drawn animals and people with no particular formulas or shapes as a reference, just looking at a photo and going for it, and they are pretty good. But I want to be REALLY good, so  I felt I needed to sharpen drawing skills with another method, this is perfect- can't wait to check out the others and see where I get in a year :)))))) thanks so much!",6년 전,12,

@xerodeus2337,"Just curious - in this video, compared to your original one about drawing heads from any angle with the loomis method - you construct the front/side jaw line divider differently.  In this video you connect it to the top of the oval, in your other video you connected it to the middle of the oval, with a sharper curve in it.  Which one is mostly correct?",6년 전,0,

@XofHope,I have Loomis' book for years and I've been stuck in one detail... how do you determine how wide the ellipse/oval (the one you draw right after the initial circle) is as you rotate the head? I always seem to get it somewhat wrong and the head ends up looking weird. Is there a mathematical rule for it?

@derderun,"First of all, thank you a lot for this video! You are one of the best resources for learning I have ever found. From editing, to music and humor, everything is on point.  I have a question in regards to one aspect of the loomis method: In your older video you draw the (as you put it) rythm of the cheek/jaw from the chin to the ear, in this new video you draw it from the chin to the top of the forehead. What is the benefit of doing it that way or is it more a head to head situation? If anybody else knows, feel free to answer as well!  Again, thank you so much!",6년 전,402,

@ProkoTV,They’re just two different rhythms. The one from the forehead to chin attaches the side plane of the jaw perfectly to the side of the cranium. So it makes more sense as two forms that lock together. The one across the cheek defines the cheek bone which is an extension off the side plane.,6년 전,135,
