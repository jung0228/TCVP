@jamesp.palamara6388,"Just to add my two cents, why was the Statue of Liberty not used as a muse for this theme. She is iconic draping , inclusive, red white and blue gold, with the the option of Adding a needed green and an eternal flame in fashion. I do not get how that’s missed. It’s right theres",3개월 전,1,
@jamesp.palamara6388,"AOCs courage was revolutionary. She went were the 1% go to evade taxes, by claiming there very presence is civil surface, and she said F U to the negligence  of the heart of the American people by those one percent. She took the power f design to the next level. She forced the privileged to reflect on their own cruelty.  I can not give her enough love: the fact she gt past the barrier to make her statement is a hero’s journey. This is historic!!! She is on the right side of everything including history and fashion.  Billy Elish, underwhelming and she had her own vice squashed and Hollywood agenda put upon her. She had so much she could have done. I’m guessing she regrets her chose. Though better to fade in the background then be torn apart. So I get it.  With all the racism that walks side by side with the red white and blue, I expected Tommy Hilfiger to be the coveted designer devout.  Debby harry was the only real patriotic look that came close to AOCs statement , in my opinion.  Your outfit was truly fabulous. So on point in this day and age.",3개월 전,0,

The tarrifs actually worked VERY WELL as the government had plenty of money for it's BUDGET without BURDENING the American people.  So it actually makes AOC look kind of IGNORANT to her countdies history.  Which is EXTREMELY SAD sin e she is a CONGRESSWOMAN and OWES it to her constituents to kNOW & UNDERSTAND our country's HISTORY  , what the FOREFATHERS INTENDED it to be, the PRINCIPLES it was ESTABLISHED on , HOW & WHY the forefathers chose to to do things they WAY they DID & WHAT they STOOD FOR and WANTED this COUNTRY to STAND FOR.

@jasonbrightman4991,"Valentino with the dress, the gloves, the hat! Doesn’t anyone else see Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany’s it’s in my mind that Holly Golighly almost wore something exactly like that in the movie. This is now my revised post. I went back and looked up the costumes and Mag Wildwood wore a hat similar to this but not quite the same she was in silver or white. Now while this screams Audrey in my mind as far as styling in actuality it’s nothing like Breakfast at Tiffany’s it’s more a reflection of the 60’s as a whole not specific to Audrey or Breakfast at Tiffany’s exactly. I correct myself as I am learning to research first not secondly before I put my foot in my mouth on a subject best left for the more skilled to comment effectively on. I’m very jeans and a tshirt 44 year old Texas man everything goes in the washer on warm at once and hopefully  doesn’t fade. If it do who care ! I wear boots and cotton only!

@bethsprow5092,fyi: This is a little long. I think that some of iconography/cultural references are being missed. Iman's look imo references the African American experience in America. So I am a white person and I am not saying that I understand the African American in total and I hope that I don't offend people. But I think that Iman's look references Africa with the use of animal motifs. and decoration. A number of important goddesses and gods of the ancient world are portrayed with snakes as a symbol of power. Because the snake sheds it's skin it a symbol of rebirth and renewal. The headdress combined with the hoop skirt I think references Scarlett O'Hara as a symbol of the American South and colonization the oppressors of African Americans and people of color around the world. The visible hoops in the skirt remind me of a cage. The transformation of the southern belle hat into a lion's mane a symbol of great power combined with the snake skin bodice represent the emergence of a powerful people from oppression.  Jennifer Lopez's look is another example of layered iconography related to the colonization of the American west combined with intense channeling of Cher. This is probably a bit of a reach but those are my thoughts. Regardless Iman is a stunningly beautiful and powerful woman and this look is amazing. Jennifer Lopez is beautiful too. I love your channel and I have learned so much. Thank you.,4년 전,16,

@thelivingdead6820,"I actually think more than half of the people did good on the theme. It’s just that the theme is so open ended it’s not going to have a collective sort of look. I saw many people reference the 1920s to old Hollywood(including many that were featured in this video), references to American culture, what it meant for them to be American, and people who kind of just stuck to colors in the American flag. When you look at the exhibit at the met that inspired the theme this makes even more sense (kind of feels like he didn’t bother).

Instead of Bjork's more (& I say this with deep fondness + respect) slightly-lumpy-dead-muppet bird version, underscore the idea that the same America that almost snuffed out their condors also brought them back from the brink, via the designer crafting it in such a way that it looks majestic modern iconic & alive instead of taxidermied or limp-abandoned-plushy-wrap.

@slsthewriter1299," @charisma-hornum-fries  …I mean, camels. Bison. Dogs. There are plenty. My point wasn't that ""horses are only American because their ancestors originated here,"" my point was, ""funnily enough, horses did technically come from North America."" Modern horses evolved from Eurasia and Africa. However, horses are still a very American experience given how much they were used during the expansion from East to West. Native Americans, too, have a huge tie with horses after they came with the settlers.  So we have that, since the beginning of America, horses were heavily involved with our expansion. Then we have the Western-cowhand culture that can be seen down to the design of the saddle. Then we have that mustangs are commonly symbols of freedom, and used as a very American thing. Blah blah blah, I can go on.  But, this comes from someone who is very familiar with horses. That, and I gotta tell you, for something to be symbolic of a thing, like a country, it doesn't have to be only a part of that country. Horses are everywhere, but you cannot sit there and tell me that America didn't create its own version of a horse to represent itself. American Quarter Horse? Very American. Thoroughbreds, not so much (pretty English breed), but Man O' War and Secretariat? Very American horses. Just like food, architecture, etc. the experiences that go with horses can be distinctive of one culture even though literally all cultures also have food, architecture, etc.  Edit: Here's a better way to put it since…I just word vomited all over. Lol. (Again, very familiar with horses. Is my study/career path.) For something to be a symbol of a country, it's not about where it originates from but rather what role it plays within its culture. Horses play a huge role in American culture as its foundation; again, the Westward expansion wouldn't have happened without horses, not how it played out at least. Same kind of thing as English tea. Very British, but tea didn't originate from Western cultures, if I'm not mistaken. Lol",4년 전(수정됨),1,

@emilyrose9518,"Just saw the Dior exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum of Art after seeing Kaia Gerber's dress on this retrospective, it is interesting to see how Oscar De La Renta referenced this Dior style.  Granted, not designed by Dior himself, Dior had stated he found and attributed much of his artistic voice in the fashion couture world through observance of American women's fashion and was a active choice in pursuit of distancing then-modern aesthetics from WWII era Parisian fashion (which he stated was in complete disarray). The ""New Look"", which I still think is very evident in this current dress and the referenced dress (1977)'s silhouette, was a rebellious push away from the war broken ""old world"" into the American ""new world,"" shaped around the modern woman's needs/ lifestyle.  As an ideology, with the dress and its referenced structure being interpreted as a clear homage to Dior's original work, the Met Gala look is successful as a deeper metaphor towards American independence and how ""the American mindset"" influenced the European fashion market from the 1940s and thereby has influenced today's.",4년 전,0,

Rihanna makes me think of this, even Kim Kardashian. 🧿 I think a lot of possible interpretations get lost here and it's a very one-sided point of view. Maybe American Independence is meant to be challenged, the concept in itself - considering what America has done to inpoversh and radically affect other countries -  is SUPER problematic. Let's talk about that. And as a white passing person, the owner of this video should be a little more careful. Aside from that, I appreciate the effort, but please do bring more political awareness to your content. I, for example, loved the references to space, to George Lucas, to the sun. America should be something everyone can relate to if it can even begin to change its racist and imperialist behavior. ""Peg the patriarchy"" can be about independence if you think about how gender norms affect the lives of people, that nationality is never the more important aspect of a community and that RACE and gender are closely aligned. 🧿 I can let these statements from white American folks pass if and only if we start recognizing that race, gender and our new ways of looking at the world should be seen as part of and stem from an intersectional framework (the only way to finding freedom, taking account that all subjectivities and identities MATTER) and, as Audre Lorde said no one is free if one of us is being oppressed. We need more perspective and openness of mind, I'm really surprised, even if some outfits weren't so easily understood, of people (and queer / cuir people) looking at these manifestations from such a simplistic view.

Even when I was in my teens and 20s we had tons of awesome theme parties - and as a singer /performer and musician - we all made those themes rocked! This was before you could be pre cut/styled ready to wear costumes at Value Village - or the Internet in the late 90s and 2000s. We were using real clothing and to theme. Don’t forget about it the huge “flapper” trends of the Weimar Republic in Germany. Between both wars. Those are like a Dior show made by my favourite Galliano. I miss Galliano. He was both me and my dads favourite. Yes my dad watched fashion shows with me and we would look at fashions mags. Before every show I do - I get all dressed up (never in black & no jeans ) dresses, hats, my hair done, accessories and shoes and before leaving the house / he would always help me - hmmm? Maybe without the belt or try those other shoes.. my dad is manly man with a perfect balance of masculinity and feminine- as well - he had to raise me since I was a baby and always dressed me in hats and pinafore dresses with - do my hair in little curly pigtails. He was bound to get get involved in fashion as he is an artist and appreciates the art of fashion. He’s straight. Yet he’s the best mom/dad  anyone could ask for - we still live together lovingly and he still helps me with my outfits for my shows with my band. Incredible eyes you have also - great honest critique. I love honesty in fashion with friends. Most of my girl friends would say Oh! You look great in that! But the wonderful thing I can appreciate from my 10 years of living only with straight men is them giving me the honest opinion and truth / yes - you look fat / butt in that. I want to know that. Wouldn’t you ? Xoxoxo from Canada 🇨🇦  There is no “H” in the word Haute couture. If wanting to use the actual French pronunciation. We are bilingual here so ... thought you may not know that or don’t care anyways. Great channel. I would go get dressed and appreciate your real hard truths and wouldn’t even get a ounce of offence. We don’t have time to get offended as musicians and performers. Even in art school our paintings were critiqued. Same in ballet. So maybe people like me - spent a lifetime of taking constructive criticism and don’t even wince. I hope more people can have some experience with that while young to grow up being more decisive and confident. Ok talk later ! Let’s see this roast go on !",4년 전,3,

@grantmegan91," @tylergab3144  Marsha wasn't at stonewall. They're stated many times saying they showed up after it all went down and saw the destruction. Also Johnson was quoted over n over that they were a man who liked to dress like women like a drag queen. The gay community was very well aware of being trans and everything under the trans umbrella, so Johnson would have had the vocabulary and understanding of what a trans person was and would have said that's what they were! It's sooo weird how we aren't completely sure how deep down Johnson identified and yet we prop them up as a trans icon and no one, not even Nicki tutorials, bothered looking into this person",3년 전,0,

@vaellietheangel,"I honestly adore your reviews, but honey... Sometimes I NEED you to look up the reasoning Behind the looks. Lil Nas X's showcase of gay american culture (especially in respect to queer coded and queer presenting stars) Naomi Osaka and several other asian americans/asian stars and celebs highlighting the history of Asian Americans on American media and design is SO important.  Billie spoke heavy marilyn monroe to me, Grimes (god, hate them but here we are) serves war and judgement and I'm sorry honey but to non-americans, that IS America. Flappers were scandalous in the US, it wasn't proper for women, the flappers of the American 20's were heavily influential on media and design of the time, and even more-so on the future push for equality. Some of these looks served camp because Rights in America wouldn't exist without it, serving western is obvious enough, serving native and indigenous influence is also obvious.  I seriously hope when you cover the other major looks you touch on the AA and Native rep there, because if I'm being honest, American independence isn't about the Red White and Blue, It's definitely more than that, and I feel like we're really face-valuing these looks here when the MET has never been a face-value lookbook.",4년 전,2,

@89visionartistry89,"You could actually make this a STATEMENT LOOK. If you look at a lot of imagery of black women during that time you’ll notice a trend in the dresses a very obviously cotton basic white idk frock dress? Is super common to see. It’s sort of boxy hits at the knee and often has a sort of bodice over it that I’m guessing the women found some way to craft. Not like a full corset but similar to a 1/2 corset that only covers the breast. Obviously they often had a large bag over their shoulder and that would be a bold touch. If you move into say the 1920’s a time when black women were able to start making more statements through their clothing you’ll notice Black women had a huge influence in the large coats with BIG fur lined collars. Someone could say add a statement piece from different eras. So maybe the basic white cotton frock, adorned with a fabulous fur coat. Black women were fashion icons in their own right at so many times in American history. The 1960’s come to mind.  I think it would be really powerful to show the evolution of black people going from the opposite of independence to where we are today paying homage to the powerful journey but somehow still representing that the journey isn’t complete. Something really bold with your hair that would catch my attention would be to have 1/2 your head of just your beautiful natural hair and the other 1/2 representing the euro centric beauty standards black people still face with their hair.

@opaluni,"It felt like most just didn't care to do enough research for anything inspired by American History or events. We have so many instances of history and legendary events they could've pulled from. Louisiana's creole culture and french/Haitian/Indian influenced society. The fashion of down home country girls, since Cottage-core is still a thing. Fashions from the pilgrims, the roaring 20s, the dust bowl era, or even rocka-billy and the 1950's. We had the 60s flower children. The glam rock era. Disco. The poodle skirts, or the iconic go-go looks. No western themes? No Native American inspired motifs? No interesting hairstyles and jewelry to reference throwback eras? No blax-ploitation ideas? No miami vice or miami nights w/ the popularity of it's tunes and dances once upon a time? No revolutionary fashion taken w/ a modern twist? Or southern belles? Or even something creative w/ denim? No sporty looks from iconic figures or a call back to American preps? No 80s looks? No jazz or Harlem Renaissance? No Dean Martin or Rat Pack influences? No Blues Singers inspired looks?  The Met Gala was an absolute failure. The disappointment.

Although I would have liked for them to have been more bold like Lupita, Iman, ASAP and a couple others. Please study fashion in America.

@emilytanner9741, @rileybushey8951  I think my meaning is more if you took the hairstyle out and the posing would she still give off a Marilyn vibe? I personally don't think so. I love Marilyn and old classic movies and while she does love the tiny waist corset top kind of dresses she loved to show off leg and wear tighter dresses. That's what she's known for. That's why I think this dress is more princess vibes. I'm thinking Cinderella or Belle. But a lot of people do think she looks like Marilyn so the styling all together was effective,4년 전,0,
@rileybushey8951, @emilytanner9741  well yeah I think it still would since the top of the dress is still almost identical to a Marilyn dress worn before but from what I’ve read the other influences aren’t princesses but rather holiday Barbie dresses so of course it’s not going to be just a tight dress bc there’s multiple influences. And yeah if you took away a couple of the things that are inspired by one of the influences that would take away a lot of that impact but that’s how anything with multiple influences would respond to that. It’s silly to say oh take away this and this when that was probably something done on purpose to give that influence as an excuse to say it doesn’t fit.,4년 전,0,

He could have went with a red lip and a simple eyeliner if he was going for a Marilyn Monroe kind of look which is what he said he was doing or an old-time Glam. Otherwise he could have done a simple smokey eye in the crease, with a Rosie lip. Or even a darker wine lip with light eye.  As for the hair -it looked unfinished. like they didn't really do anything at all. I saw all the rollers in her hair and I thought they were going to maybe do a finger curl or do apart and comb out to the side with softer curls. Over all of course she is beautiful and her gown was beautiful and that's an understatement. I just think that they did a major disservice in neglecting her hair and makeup. Otherwise it would have been polished AF. But past is the past. I just had to get that out lol it drove me nuts!  Billie is beautiful",4년 전(수정됨),0,

For men and women. Clothes that show the body or even leaving pieces of an outfit out to show areas we wouldn't normally is such a fun trend to me - I love a good blazer over exposed skin on any gender. Or even using the body as a kind of accessory or piece of the look. Fashion doesn't have to be a conservative medium, and its about time we desexualize and destigmatize both male and female bodies a bit.

First Liberace, then C-3PO in Montero kinda, then a bodycon Elvis Presley reference (notice the patterns of the beading). All three of those characters are notably coded as queer/gay (note I said “characters” and “coded”, I don’t care to speculate on real people’s private identities, nor is it relevant – also C-3PO is a bucket) and the conversation of gaudy extravagance = perversion or deviancy by way of sexuality, and how harmful that stereotype is to the gay community, is one that has come up in queer- and gender studies for decades. The pieces are all golden and embellished and, with the exception of Liberace, almost needlessly sexualized – just like how the US is often seen from our perspectives as outsiders. I get it’s not American fashion- or history references, but Lil Nas X and Versace spoke pretty loudly on American popular culture to me. Am I reaching here??

It's nothing to do with her ""confidence of not wearing baggy clothes coming out"" and also, every single piece of Jewelry she wore was made in 1900's and most of it was worn by Marilyn herself. Marilyn plays a huge part in American Independence. She's a literal icon. Please educate yourself, just because you're gay and wearing fancy clothes doesn't mean you know everything and I especially know you don't even know what you're talking about because if you did, a lot of your opinions on a lot people's looks would change because Billie wasn't the only one who based their whole look off of pure American Independence.

Barbie was as well, and Billie (who I also don’t care much about) was a major statement purely bc of what she has worn in the past, she chose the perfect moment to break this look out.

So now she shows up to a gala where people are expecting her to pull out the works and show off her body and everything as usual, and instead she does this. It feels like a fuck you to everyone, like she’s done getting glammed up and being an object for Hollywood. So she covers herself head to toe in black garments.

@Jelloitsme,"I think the theme was too…vague? Idk how to explain it but I have seen a couple of these met gala 2021 analysis videos and everyone has described the theme in very different ways without a lot of overlap. So, I’m just imagining everyone there who had to dress according to that theme and possibly being just as confused as I am about what the theme meant could be playing a part in why every outfit was so lack luster. The theme was just too “blegh” to come up with a great look that also lined up with said theme so they most likely just chose to go with one goal and kept it moving. If they chose to go with the option to go in a great look (which…debatable for some), they also figured out how it can be “on theme” on the fly because some of the ties to the theme just seemed like they were pulled out of the cracks of their…backs.

The red ribbon belt moment tied to her culture and heritage in a look linked it somewhat to the theme. I know she likes to be alot and I love that for her, I hate when people looks are plain looking it's the met gala do MORE and she did more. The only thing I didn't get was the hair, the braids were stunning but the flappy bits on the side idk about lol. They're most likely a reference to a culture I know very little about and probably have significance but they just arnt doing it for me.

You are aware Mexicans, black people and other minorities have our on cultural references, art and influences in America right?

@LowSlungBadBitch,"Not happy abt tiktokers attending, but Addison actually looked really good in the dress. The puckering lost a little of the MET gala effect when you mention it. but she looked good (not taking the theme into account, because solid red is so boring). AOC Loved it. On brand. On theme. I loved Gorman's makeup, and the color went with her skin, I loved the stars. Her head shot was stunning. Barbie looked like a gorgeous statue and a painting, really reminds me of The Birth of Venus though. I didn't like Billie's at all. Ik it was Marilyn-esque. But she looked like a blob of peach Cara Delevigne looked amazing, I loved it.  Chance looked good, pants, and shoes were boring. Chloe and Halle, I agree. No cohesion.  Ciara looked amazing. Very on point. The ode to her hubby is so cute. Dan Levi I loved it. He looked badass. Debbie Harry I didn't like it but I'm not surprised, someone was going to do it. I like the cage. I love the denim for what it represents. Dixie the gloves and the neckline i liked. Nothing else Emily she looked like she's going to a wedding, I know that's Vera Wangs thing, but it was boring. Emma was so art deco, but I also got some 60s makeup and earrings a little harley quinn moment!! I loved it. She looked like a computer chip. Gabrielle Union I dunno. White doesn't equal American, it's as basic as red. Gigi's hair and makeup looks amazing. She looks like Jessica Rabbit, based off of Veronica Lake. Grimes ?? Hailey boring, not MET she's wear that on date night Justin omfg This is definitely Zoot Suit Riot related. He's white but eh.  Hunter Apple?? I dunno, she did look amazing but like you said not on theme Iman I love the halo, she looks like a showgirl a bit. Jennifer Lopez Nothing new. She looks like a cowboy, a native American, and Clyde of bonnie and clyde. It's a cute mess. Kaia Gerber Gigi said she went simple, but this is simple. And it's beautiful. I think for MET she should have gone all out, with a bigger statement but I guess younger models don't like that. Karlie Kloss her smile is beautiful!! If you're going to wear a red dress to MET, this should be it. Kate Hudson I love the color and textures and jewelry so much but pink isn't American and neither is the set Kehlani She looks like a race car driver, specifically Dylan from the Charlie's Angels movie when she had to distract that guy. Kendall Jenner Why Audrey when Marilyn had the same dress??? Adding stars doesn't make it American in this case Kim K no. I hate it lol Kim Petras (It took me a double name to realize this is alphabetical order) Horses and roses... Idk Lil Nas X King George. Knight. Freddie Mercury. All British. Lili looked so sweet! it's definitely her personality. I think If it were the same color green as Lady Liberty, it would've killed it Lili Rose Depp It reminds me of the 50s  Lupita Nyong'o the shoulders up looked amazing, Like you said I think full on denim would have been nice but with a real strong silhouette of some kind Maluma I love it he took it and ran!! Megan Thee Stallion Marilyn never wore her hair like that, and Marilyn's dress was literally see-through and Megan usually loves showing skin, so like you said I'm really disappointed. Girl this was your moment.  Lil Uzi Vert I like it it reminds me of the 1840s in California.  Naomi Osaka I didn't like it  Normani the color was so random, bc it's already ugly and then they put it on a BIG HUGE dress with nothing on it. Olivia Rodrigo I don't like it :( Pharell & Helen real cute you said everything we were thinking.  Regina King I didn't like it in general but I see what she did American Independence Rihanna no, she had a chance and showed up to the party doing her own thing  Serena Williams All I see is lesbian flag  Timothee I love the Chuck Taylors He looks like my favorite pair of Converse the Lugged white high top  Disappointed with this.",4년 전,0,

My take is that is referencing minimal art (wich is essencially american), especialy sculpture. Read people with other ideas and i think thats the fun for us poor people.",4년 전,0,
@Emnms68,"Here are some possible references to America that I noticed and Luke may have missed: Billie Eilish: she looks very old Hollywood, and apparently the dress was inspired by those worn by the Barbie dolls she had growing up. And Barbie is a very American creation. Cara Delevigne: the bib-vest thing resembles a few things to me, including the padding worn by a baseball catcher, and the plastic riot shields carried by police officers. Chloe Bailey: her dress gives a Statue of Liberty vibe, especially with her hair styled the way it is almost forming a crown. Debbie Harry: the silhouette of the skirt reminds me of those in Gone With the Wind, and is very much so iconic of the wealthy plantation ladies of the South during the Civil War. The fact that the flag is torn and tattered seems to me to be a reflection of the state of the country during that time,(very torn, get it?) and at the same time a bit of a commentary on the (usually) Southerners who put the American flag on anything and everything, but (sometimes, not always) degrade the fundamental American ideas of freedom and equality just as the south did and fought to continue doing during the civil war. Dixie D’Amelio: the little black dress with long white sleeves and big black hat definitely evoke old Hollywood legend Audrey Hepburn to me. Gabrielle Union: the fact that it’s made of ocean plastic immediately brings to mind the fact that the US is the second largest plastic consumer in the world. Gigi Hadid: she seems to possibly be referencing Jessica Rabbit, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit is an American Film. (I know it’s a bit weak, but I didn’t say they were all super great references) Grimes: again, American Consumerism; this time with a nod to Silicon Valley. Also, the pen is mightier than the sword, maybe? Idk bout that one. Hunter Schafer: likely another reference to Silicon Valley. Lil’ Nas X: That first look feels like he’s representing the King of England in the American Revolution.",4년 전,0,

@shiftingmercury6085,Thanks Luke for your always honest and entertaining take on the failure of celebrities to follow a theme. Lol. I kind’ve felt like Grimes and Lil Nas we’re going for an American superhero type look but maybe not as they are also looks that are very closely related to their image and brands. I loved their looks though. Particularly the metallic look. I feel like the first Lil Nas look would have fit into the Catholic Imagination theme years back. He’s also been very critical of the Catholic church lately and their attitude towards gays with his new single and video of him going to hell and grinding on the devil. So maybe there is a connection there also. God only knows. Or does he? Maybe even he’s baffled by the Met Gala outfit choices too!,4년 전,0,

The larger chested women in the met gala never get a chance to experiment with looks and so it's often that you'll see them wearing a ""classic"" style dress with not a lot of variety. I mean, it's really prevalent with street style and trends. It's been a trend for models and smaller chested women to go braless and sheer tops have been popular. In the model/ fashion world, smaller chests are the popular thing. For women with larger chests, that's literally not an option because doing that can lead to back pain, discomfort, etc. It's really sad because I feel like so many of the met gala looks could have been elevated :( the theme was sooooooo vague and there was a lot of room for interpretation",4년 전,6,

@allymichael337,"Hey hey. Just a lowly PhD in American studies and I think some of the looks are deeply referencing American myths and symbols. To me Iman is channeling the Goddess Colombia which is imagery that has been utilized as the personification of “America”, dating back to 18th c.   I think you were also correct with Hunter cuz of the technology vibe and the concept of “innovation” has always been a part of the American myth. We are the “New World” which created a narrative that allowed us to justify slavery and genocide in the name of “innovation” of the land. So the fact we are still obsessed with tech and “innovation” as part of our narrative allows us to justify letting Silicon Valley run rampant. I don’t think she was offering a critique of this American innovation unfortunately, just referencing it.   Lil Nas, cuz I will not hear a word against him. Haha. Jk. But I think him focusing on his personal journey, appears to me, as becoming more independent as he peals back the layers I think is referential to America because the Black journey IS the American story. By focusing on his own self as the catalyst to explore American independence I think it’s referential to American individualism. The story of America can be traced on the Black body so a study of the self is an exploration of America.   Just some thoughts. Love this channel.",4년 전,1,

@x.Aura.x,"I'm so ready for NikkiTutorials in part 2!!! I was so moved!!! And the fact that she laid flowers for Marsha at the sight where they found her the morning of the gala before she had to go and get ready was so beyond. Like it felt like she did that for the queer community and the allies within it on a global scale. She did that for all of us. Especially those who would go to New York in a heartbeat to pay their respects but just don't have the resources to make it happen. Like I could sob all over again. The fact that she flew here from the other side of the world and made this pilgrimage to honor the life of such an important American icon. The global impact of Stonewall. It was all so moving. I'm so proud of her. I love her so much. She's like the Princess Diana of the YouTube beauty community in my eyes. And she's so much more than just an ""influencer"" and ""beauty guru"". I cannot even explain how those things just BARELY scratch the surface of the iceberg of descriptors one could use to reference Nikki and her life/career. The wisdom she carries for someone so young. The humility and ability to embrace what being human means her. The way she's moved through the good and the bad. The role model this new generation should be referencing. We stan. SHE DID. WHAT NEEDED. TO BE DONE.    (side note: the irony is not lost on me that out of the handful of people who DID understand the assignment...the majority of that handful were not even American ✌😂💓 and if that's not American in itself I don't know what is)  (side side note: Please include Sasha Velour in Part 2 as well who did not attend the Met Gala to my knowledge but instead made a short film that displayed her interpretation of the theme which I won't spoil because it's just that phenomenal and that much more impactful if you don't know any prior context. The only one to shine light on not just American fashion and influence throughout history but America's fashion labor industry and production aspect of how clothes are made. For something so short, it made a huge impact on me. I'm not sure you'll see my comment as there's so many here already, but if you don't see this before you make a part 2, I would love a part 3 for the simple fact of including Met Gala attendees who didn't go physically in person but still presented their creations digitally)  (side side side note: Willam just did a purse collection tour that you absolutely must react to. Like drag queen Willam. Please I need this. LOL)  k sorry for this massive comment I just have a lot of feelings okayyyyyy like this theme could've been so inspirational and humbling and really make Americans feel connected to each other in a time that so desperately needs connection again.....but instead we got the clearance rack at Deb........which is obviously a joke so don't come for me like I know it was hard to even create fashion pieces this year because of the pandy so I'm just happy we got SOMETHING but overall it just felt very....what we had lying around the atelier and if the samples didn't fit right welp figure it out hun we don't have time for a fitting let's just sprinkle some distraction accessories on you and hope no one notices ✌😂💓)",4년 전,1,

She was making a statement of America’s culture diversity and it not just being a white patriotic country like everyone thinks it is…. it’s actually built on everybody else’s culture.

@myyymom234," @thistagworked  I don't know which ""60's"" you're referencing, but America sure wasn't a ""European melting pot"" up until the 60's. I can agree that America has forced many cultures into assimilating into the WASP lifestyle. However, Indigenous people were here way before the Europeans ever crossed the Atlantic. Not to mention that black people were brought over during the slave trade in the 1600's and the Chinese were immigrating to the West Coast in the 1800's for the Gold Rush. Your reference of the 1960's may be referring to the Civil Rights Movement, but nonwhite cultures have always been in America and have shaped our country to be what it is today. Osaka’s look represents her culture, telling the narrative of all POC in America. You further prove her point by trying to white wash her culture and force her to assimilate to a more Eurocentric norm. If anything our American culture is one of diversity and we should let people embrace their individual cultures because we are a nation of immigrants at heart.",4년 전,17,
@highlyopinionated,I wouldn't describe America as a melting pot of cultures at all...,4년 전,1,
@myyymom234," @thistagworked  The Google definition of ethnicity is ""the fact or state of belonging to a social group that has a common national or cultural tradition"". You claim that diversity of ethnicities is fine, ""but a nation can not stand without a common culture"". So, how do you propose we reach a common culture when your idea of an American culture is limited to a ""traditional Judeo-Christian centered nation"". Given you think the diversity of ethnicities is fine, then why limit American culture to only select religions. Religion is a key element of ethnicity and the different ethnic cultures. I believe it is groups that follow a more ""traditional Judeo-Christian"" lifestyle, that are separating the nation (though I still believe in their right to practice said religion). I agree that politically we are divided beyond repair. To me, we should aim towards a diverse American culture. Together we can be united by the identity of being American, but still have pride in our individual ethnicities and heritage. Ultimately, you are only spreading hate by vilifying other religions and believing that different ethnicities can only live in harmony when they all assimilate to one blanket culture. America is a ""salad bowl"", not a melting pot. We should be able to distinguish between the different cultures and recognize everyone's unique experiences while still working in tandem with one another. You claimed that all white Americans are viewed the same because they had no problem assimilating to American culture. This is false. For example, Irish families sought refuge in America after the Potato Famine that I am sure you are aware of. Now, the Irish didn't simply assimilate to the Protestant American culture that was already established. Instead, they faced discrimination for having Catholic beliefs and were forced to find refuge in other places of America, trying to escape the negative responses from Protestants. Stores had signs stating ""No Irish Need Apply""  making it hard for them to find work, often resorting to the lowest paying and most dangerous jobs available. As a result of these tensions, a Jesuit priest named John Bapst was tar and feathered by an anti-Catholic mob in the 1850's. I don't want to have to give you a whole history lesson but European immigrants received their own level of cultural discrimination and were FORCED to assimilate due to violence and intimidation. Your rhetoric makes it seem as though whites are more well mannered and just simply submitted for the sake of the country. Not to mention that black Americans today can barely track their history beyond great grand parents due to the slave trade. They were physically taken from their native land and the Colonial forces did not keep proper records for them to track their ancestry. Additionally, the genocide of Indigenous people quite literally wiped out their ancestors which is why they are so passionate about holding onto their culture in fear of it fading. So, in a way, I agree that it is a problem how most people are so unfamiliar with their ancestry and heritage. However, this is a result of the same ideology that you are pushing. To force people to assimilate is to wipe them of their history and push them into a belief or political system that they don't view as having a ""solid moral standard"", to use your own terminology. The ""dreaded generic white American"" that you reference is a result of hateful ideologies, not the supposed assimilated white culture. The idea of being ""white Americans [that] despise themselves for being only an American"" is ironic given white Americans currently hold the majority of societal power in America and tend to be the ones oppressing the other races. It more so seems that white people seek out their ancestry in hopes for that ""1% African"" statistic that can then justify their racist ideology. I feel as though you have some of the right ideas but are completely erasing the experiences of BIPOC individuals in this country who have had to overcome insane amounts of adversity but are still expected to change to make radical conservatives feel more comfortable.",4년 전,7,
@myyymom234," @highlyopinionated  I completely agree. Another term I was taught was a ""salad bowl"". It is a more accurate analogy given we are all united, but you can still see the different shapes and colors of the salad so nobody's culture is diminished.",4년 전,1,

You took your time to almost dig for others inspo  and relation to the theme and not for others that I easily found in their Vogue interviews. Now I’m not saying it translates, but it’s fit your narrative that at least Gigi could verbally connect her look to the theme although it doesn’t visually. For example, Halle is paying homage to Tina Turner just like other girls did Marilyn, and Gabrielle Union’s basically optical illusion dress…she said its forever changing with every turn..which is very America….(and you actually like that look, so I’d figured you’d listen to her inspiration behind it, and maybe you missed it…but that’s kind of what you do) I expect more from you , hopefully for part 2 the inspiration aspect is more well researched and well rounded when it comes to all ppl you review. Vogue has a post literally just for that specific question for a reason, what inspired your look, and majority of the ppl that didn’t have visually American inspired looks in the video had a answer. Hopefully you watched Emma Chamberlain and Keke Palmer’s Vogue interviews, some celebrities got asked different questions from both Vogue interviews.

@bobcatred," @ijustexistbro  I mean… Marilyn Monroe was known for two things: bottle blonde hair and very tight, slinky dresses. She didn’t do ball gowns. Seriously, the loosest thing she’s iconically known for wearing was the white dress that she strategically wore while stepping on a vent so it’d blow upwards. Most of her red carpet looks were super tight with plunging necklines, maybe a mermaid silhouette. If she wanted to channel Marilyn in some way other than having short blonde hair, she easily could have had a dress that called back to say the gold dress or the pink dress she wore in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Both are iconic and could easily have been spun into a modern take while still saying Marilyn Monroe.",4년 전,19,

@TheWarriorpony,"The gold armour look also looks heavily inspired by art deko. Sort of like the golden figures of nick gaetano's work (the artist behind the illustrations for a lot of Ayn Rand) And whether we want it or not. The extremely individualistic ideals of Ayn Rands work are extremely American. Whether it was on purpose or not I think it's an excellent reference. The gigantic cape as well has a very religious aesthetic, which could be a commentary of the overwhelming presence of religion in the US. Meanwhile the bodysuit brings iconic black artists and gnc legends like Prince to mind. I think there's a lot of referwnce there, but if it was on purpose is a different question.   For me he was very on theme, representing 3 wildly different aspects of American culture (religious dominance, representations of idealized masculinity using the very american aesthetic of nick gaetano's work and the cultural relevance of the works that made him famous (through Ayn Rand's books) and the legacy of Iconic gender non conforming black american artists in whose footsteps he's stepping.

@friv_0881,"Glad to see that there are other people who see Grimes's hypocrisy  and how fake and flipfloppish she has been when it comes to her Highly fabricated backstory (much like Elon's) and her stance on issues and beliefs.   She has gotten much more popular and mainstream thanks to her relationship with Elon  ( and the benefit  of his money and access to celebrity and business circles)   Grimes used to be more original and credible  earlier in her career ( though,  even that seemed to be a pick me version of a ""cool alternative girl""persona to a degree as well) but the sad fact is, Grimes grew up privileged in a rich family, dropped out of a university that her parents paid for, then tried to convince  the public that a few years of voluntarily  ""slumming it "" for her art somehow makes her authentic and relatable to the lower class.  She took one elective biology course on how the human ear hears while studying  Russian literature, but was never majoring in neuroscience . Her fans  believe that she is a supergenious and So unique but even her esthetic can be traced back to the many typical girls posting online.  Her other  claim is that she produces all of her own music, but her last album had a fair amount of outside professional producers on it to help her.  There is also a reason that Grimes has gotten in so many battles with her many previous labels and has to keep signing to new ones. Her recent signing to a big mainstream label ( all while getting Canadian tax credits and music grants when she doesn't  even live in Canada and is a millionaire in her own right- very suspect and manipulative)  When she has the money and means to be Independent  or start her own label, just shows how fame and power hungry she has become( when she used to say that she didn't  care and was purely in it for the ""art"") Grimes has stated so many times that she is more comfortable doing everything herself and that labels just interfere, so to sign to a major label when she has the means and ability to do it herself seems to speak to greed ) It's  sad because she does have talent but she is so problematic as a person, esp. When it comes to what she says. - also her recent selling of NFT's  is purely a greedy capitalist move  that seems very predatory of her fans- she has no qualms bleeding them of their hard earned money for basically nothing. Grimes is all about making money now over  the quality of her art.",4년 전,2,

@fys192,"26:28 I beg to differ on Gabrielle Union's dress. At first glance, it may not look like it has anything to do with America but when you think about it, the dress is produced from ocean plastic, right? The USA has some of the biggest fast fashion brands e.g. Gap, L Brands, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, American Eagle Outfitters and Abercrombie&Fitch. The fast fashion industry is one of the biggest contributors of ocean plastic pollution. A dress (fashion) made of plastic represents an issue that is faced in modern USA. Sustainability is definitely ingrained in America's fashion lexicon 💁",4년 전(수정됨),1,

@cheyannekillin9266,"RE: Lil Nas X  I fully disagree that he didn't follow the theme, and here's why.   Lil Nas X's journey through the music industry is also heavily intertwined with the relationship between Black men, conservative America, gayness, and Christianity (specifically, evangelical Christianity). By starting from a Pope-adjacent cloak that conceals 99% of himself, he is showing how American culture, which is heavily dictated by the Christian religion, forced him to conceal. Then, after being attacked, he had to protect himself from that cultural drag (the suit of armor), and his final bodysuit look showcases his own American independence... not only as a musical creator who can now release his artistry without death threats and damnation but also existing openly as a proud Black gay man.   His looks represent the new era of American independence: not from Britain, but from each other and from the grasp of cultural and religious figures that condemn anyone who doesn't agree with them or follow their doctrine. Queer liberation is absolutely 100% on-theme, and Lil Nas X did it PERFECTLY.",4년 전,7,

@sarahlelys9268,"Okay, this is just a stupid idea coming from a girl who knows nothing about fashion, but the concept of Lil Nas X's three-part fashion event could actually have been pretty good and could have been right on theme. His three-part costume could have represented the story of America. The first part -- the imposing dress -- is actually perfect: it is the exact image of a monarch's dress, and it is golden and heavily embroidered, just like a crazy king with too much money and a big ego and no care at all for his subjects could have worn. Then Lil Nas X drops it, symbolically stripping America from its kingly clothes and stripping the king from his American colonies (hello hello, American Independence theme!) and then beneath it you can find clothes that embody a certain idea of America -- wealthy, heroic, proud America. The superhero type of look could have worked well, if it had had some heavy American symbolism, like colours or something. Then finally Lil Nas X drops that American look too, to reveal a third and final look -- one that could illustrate his beef with America and things that are wrong with America. Clothes in tatters for example to illustrate systemic poverty, signs of violence to show what the MAGA ideal is doing to gay people and black people -- I don't know, as I said I know nothing about fashion, but I think there was a way to showcase this sort of idea. Let's just say that initially when I saw the heavy golden robes I really thought Lil Nas X had gone with something like that -- apparently celebrating America and its independence only to show what its outdated and cruel ideals have done to this country.",4년 전,0,

Lil Nas X might have been trying to say that he found his independence in America by shedding the various costumes assigned to him by our culture until he got down to the one that was appropriate to who he really is. Maybe I'm reading too much into these, but some of the outfits seemed to play on the absence of independence or freedom in modern day America.

According to Kendall and Matthew Williams from the bts from vogue, they mentioned that Audrey Hepburn was always in Givenchy in her movies and she was friend with Givenchy just like Kendall being friend with Matthew Williams. Her look is definitely my favourite, the rhinestones beaded on her dress are falling beautifully on the carpet. It took two thousand and five hundred hours to turn this dress into life. And I’m really loving it. It’s such a piece of fine craftsmanship. I couldn’t imagine anyone other than the only Kendall Jenner in this dress.

@Toyon95,"""Art"" is referencing and talking about different subjects all the time, so I don't understand why the lack of inspiration at an event like this? Maybe some of these designers would be helped by using the perspectives of artists of other mediums. Here is how I would do the assignment: ""Independence"" makes me think about the different groups in America and their strife for independence and freedom throughout history. I think politics, freedom of speech, voting etc... As a woman I would reference the feminist and suffragette movement which is a big part of my life, but I would do it by highlighting how not all women were included historically. So I would go to a designer (or group) of some of these excluded minorities to work with when creating the garment. I have no ideas as to what it would look like. Purple and green are my favorite colors, but maybe that would be to on the nose- but seeing some of the creations at the Met maybe it would be ok lol.",4년 전,60,

I think Yara Shahidi did this amazingly this year as on the surface level it fits the theme as it's a beautiful, clearly 1920s inspired dress, and then you find out it is inspired by Josephine Baker, a famous black American icon, and it adds a new layer of appreciation.

@octo448,"I feel your 'acceptable' interpretations of the theme aren't being nearly flexible enough. People thought more outside the box and cleverly about their looks this year, and I think that's appropriate considering what happened in 2020 and is still very much happening. America is something to be critiqued, and I think a lot of the gowns did that in subtle, cheeky ways. Interpreting it just as ""must be referencing an American designer or including a flag"" is so limiting and not really the intention, at least not as I perceived it.   Take the look at 23:50. That is obviously another reference to Audrey Hepburn. I think it's actually super clever for a European designer to reference a European who made her fame in Hollywood, practically defined everything that came after, and eventually became an American fashion icon all without ever actually being American. Same goes for the one you named as being a ref to her at 39:14.   The ""Peg the Patriarchy"" look is TOTALLY on theme. Patriarchy is steeped into the very bones of the United States, and the top looks like a bulletproof vest or some kind of military gear. Having that statement on that piece and then having the tailored white pant just makes me think of going to war with the patriarchy and not caring who you have to F*ck to do it. that's a statement on America if I've ever heard one.   Grimes' sword was forged from a melted down gun and she looks like she's dressed for war- referencing the American inner conflict over the 2nd amendment. It's no coincidence her other hand is holding a book- the most vocal opponents of firearms are people who are highly educated and those who work in schools.   Lil Nas X went with looking at American excess- gold on gold on gold, lavish, taking something and making it so over-the-top that it's unbelievable. The final look was a very rock 'n roll style to me, just updated to be more sexy and less campy. I was a little shocked you called it out while literally having it facing, because it SCREAMS rock'n'roll to me. Elvis would have totally worn that... well, when he was more trim, anyway.   Olivia's look said Madonna meets punk rock to me, which suits both her musical trajectory and inspiration and fits the theme.   Some of the ones you praise highly were just so on-the-nose. Like, I feel like any third grader would come up with making a ballgown like the stripes on the flag. Having them be unwound and unfinished was a neat idea, but the overall concept was so boring. Anything that just said ""Hey how can we use stars and stripes to make it American-y"" missed an opportunity to do literally anything more interesting.",4년 전,140,

She mentioned how it was important to her to have the words of The New Colossus, the poem at the base of the Statue of Liberty,  incorporated to her look, and that is why she is wearing that purse.

@narsis273,"You know, people can have their different interpretations on anything even if the stylist really didn't think of what you got from some of the looks and it's normal so I agree on the American independence part that they could have a point, but on the american fashion I don't agree with your first claim at all. Referencing to audrey Hepburn is the most basic choice a person makes while referencing to Hollywood and wearing a black dress with white gloves is also the most basic look inspired by her we have seen it already gazillion times. There is nothing clever in doing so. And it's not about how a white european could go to Hollywood and make a name for herself or referencing a dior dress which is a very french thing! it's about american fashion and independence.",4년 전,14,

Anyway, I WAS going to say that this reminds me of a class project in school where my classmates and I chose either an emotion or a specific word and dress up in our vision based on the emotions or specific word. Like the first guy that went up to say his poem is about love and he was the word love and dressed in the color red. Or like me for example: my word was hope which really meant a lot to me at the time (2017) and I did my research and the color green represents that color and I read my poem and I got excellent results but main thing is everyone else wore black???

Two completely different ideas. And American fashion is not one thing or one specific look. It’s hard to pin down. Thats why the exhibit is called a Lexicon of American fashion. It’s trying to show a lexicon (complete set) of American fashion but misses out on a lot and implies a more sophisticated and elegant approach American fashion.   Denim, patchwork, quilting, spandex, indigenous costume, cotton jersey these are the looks I expected to see.   Kim Kardasian wearing  jersey cloth costume fit the theme perfectly, as well as A$AP rocky wearing the quilted blanket look.

@LadyNarcissa," @poppyisyourmommy6956  you see it depends. I speak from Japanese studies experience, so it'll be different for other ethnicities. However, each time we held any event at which the students and some uni stuff would be dressed in kimono the Japanese people we encountered were over the moon to see us Europeans dressed in their traditional clothing. One thing was we knew how to do it, so it wasn't a bathing robe, some curtain around the waist and call it a day. They saw we cared, took the effort and appreciated part of their culture, that has been in decay for years now. Japanese people my age would know how to put on a yukata (summer cotton kimono, very casual) but with formal ones not at all. One girl from exchange was super impressed that I distinguished furisode (long sleeve maiden kimono) and knew the name, because even her classmates at home didn't know it.  So if you get dressed appropriately to show the respect to the culture, to educate those around you it's appreciation and would be welcomed. If you pretend you do and just do whatever for clout that's when it gets problematic and should be called out. What comes to my mind is many singers doing a ""summer song MV"" with a America's indigenous people's headdress, even though they've asked for years now to not do it. But no, it's cool, looking fancy shmancy, there's no summer without feathers on your head, so they go for it. Pure ignorance and arrogance, but try calling them out...",4년 전,0,

@Emilia-rx5or,"I see some people saying that this theme was a lot easier than past met gala themes. I have to disagree. The fact that it is seemingly „simple“, basic and not too crazy is the hard thing. It‘s actually a lot easier to just go all out for abstract themes, like camp, or pack on a lot of metallics for „manus x macchina“ or create something new and eccentric for „heavenly bodies“. For all these themes most hit the mark by going over the top, utilising colour, sparkle etc. American fashion - it’s a great theme, so many possibilities and they could have done so much better, don’t get me wrong! But you have to go wayyy more in depth, you have to research more, reference cultural moments, reference cultural groups, reference past celebs, and can work less from your abstract imagination like in other themes. Would this still have been possible? Absolutely. They would have had to invest more time in it!!",4년 전,254,

It starts off with what looks like a quintessentially English cape that someone like King George III would've worn at the time of the American Revolution, and it ends in a very modern American male silhouette.

@emilyb3875, @resstie  Her hair and makeup are Diana that’s what ruins it for me (no hate to Princess Di but she’s British) marilyn’s clean makeup and soft curls were just as iconic as her clothes but Billie’s hair and makeup team failed her,4년 전,14,

@magicscoolbus3834,"Mmm to me she looked more like a 50's urban american wife, let me tell you why the shiffon wrapped around her shoulders is more conservative wife than miss Monroe cuz she wasn't shy about her girls😂 and also the flaring of the dress if you imagine shortening the length to maybe her knees: 50's wife. Monroe liked most things very fitted, now Billie's make up n hair; that IS Marilyn Monroe!🙌 and that color👏",4년 전,3,
@earthcitty," @magicscoolbus3834  I actually totally agree with this assessment.  The length of the dress particularly, they should have done an asymmetrical that started at the 1950's iconic length that Marilyn was seen in so often, then let it soft flow to the ground.  The look was...almost more Jayne Mansfield imitating Marilyn (which is still American, just not what they were going for.)

@Totorh03,"Ehhhh I have a problem with the way the saying “Peg The Patriarchy” was used by Cara Delevigne because it lacks the needed context.  I go on for a while so don’t bother reading unless you are interested.  Here it’s reinforcing a negative assumption that being fucked (especially anally) is degrading and that the person being fucked is being dominated. That it’s about power. Which it isn’t about. We have been saying and explaining that it isn’t about that in the hopes that gay men would stop being belittled for what they may or may not enjoy doing. We have started as a society to say “hey, what you like sexually doesn’t necessarily dictate who you like it with aka your orientation or identity because sex is about pleasure so get it however you like it”.  Because I am shit with my words I will also share what others have said that I agree with to help develop what I am trying to say.  My friend said: “The phrase ‘Peg The Patriarchy’ was coined by a sex and pleasure educator which could be kind of dope in the sense that pegging is about “subverting power” during sex. But penetration (even the subversive kind, ie. pegging) should not equal power and by suggesting that an alternative form of penetration with a phallic object such as pegging is about reclaiming power is to equate power with penetration which to me sounds patriarchal”.  And I think they are pretty fucking spot on. Or should I say, it hits the prostate.  They added: “Why is pegging used in a threatening way? Because it’s seen as demasculinizing which is just homophobic. It’s also just a rape joke, gross.”   cough Pulp Fiction you really gone and fucked up. The most disgusting and unfunny part of Tarantino’s entire career. It was unnecessary and created even more terrible rape jokes along the same lines. cough  Someone else also said: “Promoting the idea a man taking a woman’s dick in his ass necessarily involves being overthrown, overpowered, annihilated, destroyed, abolished, embarrassed, humiliated, discomfited, or otherwise shamed as men traditionally shamed women is actually exactly the work of the patriarchy”.  One last quote: “Penetrating someone doesn’t make you dominant. It doesn’t make you a badass. Being penetrated doesn’t mean you’re being dominated or belittled. Yes. Even if you are a man. You can engulf that dick like the bad botch you are or service fuck someone with a total focus on their pleasure. These are all options”.  Thank you for coming to my TED Talk",4년 전,17,

Ciara is doing the Seahawks color rush uniform which is a bright, highlighter green from head to toe and is universally panned by football fans.

It just doesn't make sense to wear urban attire to a regal elite fashion event. You're supposed to dress the occasion.  Theres just certain things you don't wear to certain events. That's like going to a funeral wearing a short bright minidress and flashy eye makeup. It doesn't fit the theme it doesn't fit the dress code.

@MultiEquations,"My interpretation of her dress was to make people think, as fashion should.   On the front, it looks like a nice simple, off-the-shoulder tuxedo-inspired dress, a throwback to the white suit she wore when she was sworn in as a congresswoman. However, even the color white has a complicated history in the US. Commonly associated with the US women's suffragette movement of the 19th and 20th centuries, it was meant to symbolize purity, a term with a very complicated history in the US. One of the ways the US suffrage movement was successful was by playing into the stereotype that by them getting the ability to vote, they weren't challenging the status quo of men (especially white men) and the mainstream suffragette movement had several major figures who played up this dynamic and were racist and excluded BIPOC activists. Native Americans weren't granted full citizenship until 1924 with the Snyder Act and the 19th amendment was passed in 1920, meaning that any Native American couldn't technically vote until 1924 and they left enforcement up to states. As a result, some states either didn't care to extend voting resources to these communities or deliberately did so.   Fashion has always been political and anyone who says otherwise is naive. American politics has rapidly become polarized over years, and the American government's design benefits those who are partisan. Unlike many countries globally, the US doesn't have a parliamentary system in which minority governments can be formed. AOC has always stood firm in her beliefs, so I disagree with those criticizing her for not ""reading the room."" Now, I'll reveal my bias because I really like what she stands for as a politician. She had always made political choices regarding fashion; it's just another medium for her to express her beliefs. For instance, she wore red lipstick to her swearing-in because a consultant for Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor once told the future justice to wear nude nail polish to avoid any additional scrutiny. You cannot miss the racial, gender, ethnic connotations of that suggestion. Another instance could be found when she wore a red blazer to her speech condemning Rep. Yoho for calling her a ""bitch"". Society puts women or femme-presenting people down for enjoying stereotypical ""girly things"" and trying to be serious all the time. It's literally the plot of the iconic 2004 film ""Legally Blonde"" and they still do. God forbid, if a politician wants to partake in one of fashion's most important nights.   As for the message in the back, it's widely known that AOC heavily believes in increasing the taxes on the uber-wealthy. Fashion can be frivolous but at the end of the day, making clothes is a job and a multi-million dollar industry in the US that heavily depends on the exploitation of severely underpaid women both domestically and abroad. Fashion/clothes is also an art, so her showing up with a massive ""Tax the Rich"" message on the back to a fashion event where the biggest donors are often individuals who try to cheat the US tax system isn't a slap to any artisan or designer's face but a reminder that the fashion and art worlds have to innovate and move forward. You can have nice clothes and be environmentally friendly, the person making your clothes should have access to affordable/universal healthcare, artisans should be paid a living wage and the people who consume fashion and art should all pay into a more equitable tax system.   2020 was the first year in which Amazon paid a significant amount of taxes this year and in 2018, they paid no federal income tax and one doesn't have to be an accountant to tell you that Amazon did make any money that year, especially when we look at how much Jeff Bezos' wealth grew those two years. They got away with it because they knew how to game the US tax system. One of the ways that wealthy Americans get out of paying their tax bills is through philanthropy. I'm not saying all philanthropy is bad but people do definitely take advantage of it. Billionaires such as Michael Dell have said that he is more comfortable giving money to charity than giving it to the government, aka taxes. Yes, the government could better spend money in certain areas but there's something absurd about a nation who spends trillions of dollars on defense and wars every year but still can't scrape up enough money to purchase up-to-date textbooks for certain schools. While some wealthy individuals have generously spent their money on important causes such as public health or higher education, it is ridiculous for communities to depend on the generosity of rich people to fund public services especially in the US, an insanely wealthy country. Charity is nice but isn't and shouldn't be the government. Also, allowing the uber-wealthy to shirk out of paying their fair share only creates a more unequal country which isn't one that is very pleasant to live in. For example, it is important that everyone receives a nice, well-rounded K-12 education and not just those who happen to live in a district with a wealthy family who can fund an aviation-focused charter school (a real thing).   Long story short, AOC did ""read the room"" or wasn't being tacky. She has always made her fashion choices political and the Met Gala was going to be no exception. Fashion has always been political and it's important that the uber-wealthy pay more in taxes so we have a more equitable society (both her and my opinion). If anything, I wish the words on the back of her dress were embroidered instead of screen-printed and the dress was better fitted in the back.  *Edited for grammar",4년 전(수정됨),0,

Based on your genetics from how your family’s lives were it can be extremely hard to gain or lose weight. Like how Samoans have naturally wider builds or other ethnic groups.

@emmad4308," @chanelghostin6060  some people have medical issues which means it's not so simple as just going to the gym. For example, my mother has a thyroid issue (an autoimmune disease) which means her metabolism is EXTREMELY slow. Add in the fact it's much harder for women to lose weight, and it's super difficult for her. But she eats reasonably healthy, and goes for runs and paddle boards.   Weight management also depends on genetics, diet, and other factors such as how you have been raised, mental health, availability of healthy food, if it's financially viable etc. also if you're a uterus owner, can depend if your pre or post menopause.   It's a more complex issue than you would expect, so don't just dismiss it as ""just going to the gym"".   Everyone should be allowed to enjoy nice clothes; clothes you feel good in do wonders for your mental state. Idk why are you so against people enjoying things???

The fact that people KNEW that was Kim Kardashian (aside from questioning what the hell was going on)  says a lot about american culture and the impact or influence of this figures  (famous people) have in the country. On a side note it could also be referrencing the nowadays  occidental toxic standarts for beauty, that again have a lot to do with this A-list celebrities which somehow are connected with America since it's a country where a lot of them work, live, etc?.  To some people this may sound a bit arrogant from her part that Kim is basically  saying ""hey, i am the moment and huge psrt of american culture"" but there's a hint of truth at how much this people matters to america (talking of it as a nation) , how often they are idolized and put in a pedestal, and how somehow the high-class, holywood, elite celebrities had become a symbol, representation of  part of the United estates identity especial highlight since the patriotism of a country derives from national symbols, which is fundamental in any country. In relation with the last part, whether it's good or bad it's up to each person since we can't really discuss history or any social context/ocurrence from moralism. Finally I want to say that this is just my interpretation about the meaning behind the look, I don't claim to be any fashion critique or frar from it I am just giving my analysis about the costume and the relation with America.

I didn't say anything about Marsha's gender, just that I thought they started the riots, given I'd see at least 2 documentaries saying that. I always welcome learning though, and if I'm incorrect based on what I've been taught i'm thankful to be corrected as I said in my previous comment. There's no need for the snark though, I didn't argue it. I'm thankful to learn if I'm incorrect or ignorant to something, nobody is born knowing everything, especially in regards to something that is literally word of mouth in a country across the ocean",4년 전(수정됨),5,

@user-KK812,Omg hey Elizabeth !! I love your videos !,4년 전,0,
@rat1906, @evangeline77x  But it sounds like that’s all you heard. You misunderstood the original comment immensely. The point was that the word trans was not such a big thing and that identity did not exist in the way it does now. Just like many things the words we used to describe things now did not always exist before or did not always be used in the same way.,4년 전,0,
@evangeline77x," @rat1906  Oof, my guy 🙄  The reason I only addressed that point (good job sussing that out btw!) was because it was literally the sole basis of their argument for why Marsha's preferred pronouns should not be respected. My point stands; Mainstream society/layman's understanding of trans identities in the 70s would have zero bearing on the matter, especially when people were actively transitioning and medical transition was already a long standing practice of the era. Therefore citing that ""trans identity didn't exist in the 70s"" (even just in the context of mainstream society's understanding of trans identities) is still not a valid argument for misgendering Marsha. At the time in question Marsha's gender identity was female, she presented female and while she may have been fluid at other times in her life, her preferred pronouns were always female. Marsha was a part of a greater community of queer and trans women (for example Jayne County, who was also at the stonewall riots, who famously transitioned in the 70s, earlier than that there were minor NY celebrities like Candy Darling and Holly Woodlawn who both transitioned in the early 1960s), so even in that era Marsha would have been fully aware of what being trans meant and was more than capable to advocate for her own preferred gender identity. So there is literally no reason to argue for misgendering her, and citing the era as an excuse to do so is both presumptuous and ignorant.",4년 전,0,

Any actual ""American"" fashion pieces would be indigenous. But the theme just ended up being old Hollywood references, with no consideration of our country's true origins.",4년 전(수정됨),8,
@claranguyen2738,Isn't the theme American and America is a diverse multicultural country now. Anything should be accepted.,4년 전(수정됨),1,
@claranguyen2738,"Rethink what is America, it is made up of different cultures. It is still part of history whether it originated in America or not, it became American. Like the Black Panther speech. We are of one world and all cultures have contributed into what is America today.",4년 전,1,
@kakussubrado8966," @alwayschasingrabbits  oh! Is that so? I have to admit, i have little to none prior knowledge of what the exhibit really was for! But thank you for enlightening me on that one!   I guess I saw the theme as an opportunity to interpret the country's aspects in a more holistic manner like its culture, norms, history, music, customs etc etc. Again, thanks for this 💜",4년 전,0,
@kakussubrado8966," @greyguu8262  this! This was my issue! Thank you for translating it in a much brief and concise way! I had a hard time pointing out where the problem is, but this comment helped me a lot!   And yeah, sadly, America is indeed a melting pot of various culture now which is what makes it more beautiful as a nation — even though it still has its own share of shortcomings!   Although it would've been cool if the Indigenous culture or even the metro-urban styles were given the same amount of highlight like the reimagined Hollywood Glam! It could've add more flair and personality to the gala.   But that's just me though 😅",4년 전,1,

@shushuwu," @claranguyen2738  Oh my goodness another snowflake living in dreamland!  Why don’t you check into American immigration policies .  But this is about a party, and you were doing backbends to avoid following a simple yet clear and concise theme because you can’t be bothered!🤦🏽‍♀️",4년 전,0,
@shushuwu, @koostattoos-8859  yes you can blame the attendees you work with your designers to create the lock these B’s couldn’t be bothered because they have no creativity.,4년 전,1,
@koostattoos-8859," @shushuwu  you missed my point dude. i'm referring to what designers they go with, not to what they wear (and some don't even have a say in what they wear, depending on their celeb status).",4년 전,0,
@shushuwu," @koostattoos-8859  Actually, no!  The celeb works with the designer to put together a look, go through the archives or design the look.  Followed by fittings till final look is achieved.  So if somebody shows up looking like a whore ready for Halloween,  that is the look they were going for.  If they show up in the theme ready for the party that is the look they were going for.  You can’t think for one second that Rihanna couldn’t have tore the house down yet again?  That any fashion house would have killed to dress her?  Yet she picked a gorgeous coat that had NOTHING to do with the theme.  Yeah you’re thinking holds not one drop of water!",4년 전(수정됨),0,
