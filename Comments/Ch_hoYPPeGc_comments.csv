Everyone knew what Epstein was about, and no one spoke out and some enjoyed Epsteins evil. Really cant stand these creeps who sell their soul for fame. Yes they are talented and artistic. But most have been currupted by a sexually deviant, evil, hypocritical industry. They Never spoke out about Harvey Weinstein and everyone knew the truth long before it came out. Directors couch didnt come from nothing. They all knew the evil crap in their industry and they either stayed silent or participated actively, and then want to preach to other people how to live our lives.  Think about the climate they all preach.  Meanwhile their footprints are 1000k times bigger than most of the worlds population with private jets, 20 cars, multiple mansions, yacts.

We always had alot of peanut butter and usually honey and cheese and bananas so you get the picture. Nothing like a honey peanut butter grilled cheese and a glass of milk to tame the munchie monster.

The collective 'we' all lose when a particularly well-loved personality dies.  I'll pick a very well known well-loved person: Princess Diana.  Arguably the most well-known woman of her time. At her untimely death millions mourned and felt a personal loss because of her ability to connect with many an  everyday citizen from literally anywhere.      The sorrow pain and shock felt by all those 'unknowns'  is not the same as her family and loved ones of course. But the emotions  are still valid and real.,3년 전,9,

@RasMajnouni,"Age 17 moved in on my own apartment.TV? Since 1970 have not seen a show. Yet, I admit, when much later first seeing YouTube I had a 3 minute peekaboo of   S N L  & closed it. ""Oh how the Mighty have fallen"" (USA) Being cynical was the NEW Hip and when all the Americans can be Hip, what IS hip? The same assholes you have seen on S N L from 1975 until last night. Most of the world looks at MERCA and we  sadly shake our heads in sadness.  S N L : ""WAYNE""  played the most cynical slob. It wasn't Mike Myers per se ,he acted the role of the most cynical low-life in the film. Wayne is the opposite of Garth. No human is at fault for a bit less intelligence. Its who and what that human was given : an under-average human intelligence or an over-average human intelligence. The human brain is simply a cold slab of meat!  An IQ of 84 or an IQ of 104, same flesh. But a brain which acknowledges the HOT beating heart as well as the soul can recieve life from it's own human heart and Godly soul  ,rule the heart by fanning his own heart flame to a simple human life that respects all others. WAYNE had no respect for Garth,no respect for all the people in the film and NO respect for:""Wayne!!! The Wayne's of the WORLD I ever came across my so far 69 years were side-stepped by myself as if they were a small piece of dog shit. If they sensed why and approached me, they left within 19 seconds of hearing the truth about what they already knew about their inner selves. LUCKLY most of you and I met them from age 11-17.

Actually that might not be accurate because I tried watching even after 2001-2002, when it wasn't funny just to give it the benefit of the doubt hoping it would be funny again some day soon but it never happened. Long story short this episode came out in 2009 and isn't funny and aged like potato salad left in the car for a few hours on a sunny 100F day. This shitshow died in the early 2000s and it's on life support...let's hope the WuFlu  finishes it off! Also Tommy running off to Greece in a hurry after it came out that we use to love taking the Lolita Express a LOT. Again SNL sucks, so does NBC, and you wouldn't know what is funny unless someone dumped gas on you and threw a book of matches at your feet. Now that...THAT would be funny!

@joweemac," @wildmercuryfilms   So lets say all that is true, the thing that is scary and has the political to hurt us all is the way Trump divides us all trying to put one citizen against another. He should coincide and fight that argument differently. His behavior is sketchy in so many ways.... like the way he turns on his friends if they don’t agree with him.....such behavior from a dude from such a high office is scary...... I really think he puts himself first and you and I second by far.....It all goes too character, he’s just not a guy i would trust.... he really thinks he is better than every President in history .....",4년 전,0,

Kam was (sadly) a bit financially strapped and needed the money.  Ofc, he didn't bother to remind the producer, director, and writers that the Chin character had been killed off in the original series. 🤔😆",4년 전,1,

@crazychristopher1989," @billybones1694   Here's the thing. To actually outlive someone, you have to at least reach the age of someone who died before you and it's usually that of someone who is older than you are. Let's say for example you pass on unexpectedly at the age of 35. I'm only three years younger and I'm still alive. So if I were to live to 35 but die within a few months shy of being 36, then I can say that I outlived you because you were older and you died first. Outliving someone doesn't work when you're younger than someone who passed on no matter the longevity.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

You can however say you outlived someone else provided that person would be younger than you were at the time of death before you end up dying yourself.

Besides a few funny skits, like Belushi as the samurai, the Coneheads or the Lupners, I'm mystified that anyone could compare.  Every show has a stinker, but the production is amazing and the cast is so talented. Let go of the past.  The cast always changes and that's the best part of SNL.

There is NO REASON WHY we should pay attention to their political or personal opinions because those opinions DO NOT MATTER more than the opinions of anyone else you meet on the street, your friends, your family, or yourself!  3. THE LIBERAL MEDIA'S USE OF CELEBRITIES, SINGERS, SPORTS FIGURES, ACTORS AND AUTHORS TO PROMOTE BIASED POLITICAL PROPAGANDA AND SOW DIVISIVENESS IN OUR COUNTRY CLEARLY SHOWS THAT THE LIBERAL MEDIA IS TRYING TO UNDULY INFLUENCE OUR MINDS AND THE MINDS OF OUR YOUTH TO HELP DEMOCRATS ACHIEVE THEIR AGENDA AND CONTROL AMERICAN POLITICS!

Its my speculation that comedy has suffered due to the political influence that delegates of state power put upon them but inviting them to parties, vacations, gifts ect ect.

I don't know which episode I like most, but my favorites are this one, the one where he misreads ""Japan-U.S. Relations into ""Jap Anus Relations"" and turns his first grade math problem of 0+0-0=0 into the word ""poop,"" and the one where he misreads ""An Album Cover"" as ""Anal Bum Cover"" and draws a picture of a horse having sex with Trebek in response to ""Make Up a Question of Your Own."" Anyway these are my top 3. And here he certainly is artistic. He can turn his created, yet nonsensical word, IOISSSB into a picture of himself shitting on Alex Trebek's grave. Does he think Alex Trebek will die before him? And he's vulgar too, in that he thinks Trebek's mustache is there to ""Catch the Semen"" (Ewww!) when he means to choose ""Catch These Men.""

@raymondhill7837,">I said this drivel is communist - and also - that its not comedy  Not according to anyone but snowflakes like you. And you claimed ""dumbing down society"" is communism, which again, has no meaning.  I swear this ""anything that I don't like is communism"" trend that the nu-snowflakes adopted has diluted the meaning of communism to the point that it has no real meaning.  > And of course you march around with your fellow brain dead millennials - you need to get out of your moms basement every now and again dont you?

@uptonroboticsptyltd3665,There was a real jeopardy show that was totally hilarious with the real Sean Connery. The rumour is that Sean did not approve of the show and has tried to have it deleted from history. It is actually the funniest thing I have ever seen on Earth. I think the issue was that Mr Connery considered himself too good an actor to appear on Jeopardy and so decided to protest by giving everyone a very hard time. Rumour was they tried to replace Sean mid episode with Burt Reynolds who mysteriously appears then disappears. I still laugh to this day.... The SNL  sketch only manages to capture 5% of the hilarity of the original episode.,8년 전,92,

@uptonroboticsptyltd3665,"Bob Thenob It is my understanding that Sean Connery dislikes the original and  tries to delete all copies. I guess that  Sean thinks the original shows him in a bad light. However, I feel  it doesn't. It is incredibly funny. Like easily the funniest thing I have ever seen. It is my understanding the SNL sketches were an attempt to recreate some of the humour because the originals have been lost.

@madvicar," @dirtyharry0191  Are you referring to the great Hankov Tomsk? I saw him when I was in the Balsdip Region of Krakhozia, and although I was busy doing something else at the time, his impersonations were impressive. I also saw him on the strange 58-line State-owned TV channel (Krakhozias Arss) programme ""Esstidis"" where Hankov although 85 years old, looked the very image of the star of the American comedy film ""Bachelor Party"". Can't remember his name though. My mind is clouded by the torture meted out to me for forgetting to throw a dog over my right shoulder on the first day of the Krakhozian national holiday ""Crabbs"", where I was locked in a room and forced to listen to a one-legged deaf mute in another room tell a fifteen hour anecdote about about a chicken, a tree, and a small patch of mud repeatedly whilst glistening mutated sea creatures (how they get there is a mystery since the country is landlocked and mostly desert) beat me about the face and neck with rolled up weaponised copies of the sheet music to Take Me Out To The Ball Game. Still, the price of the holiday was quite reasonable for the late 70s in the middle of the oil crisis, and I'd go again, but the whole country mysteriously disappeared about ten years ago, around the time Earth gained its second moon. Did we meet there?",7년 전,4,

On the tv show My Name Is Earl they had some episodes with Burt Reynolds, then Burt's character died in the series and his son took over. His son was little chubby played by Norm being the character just like Burt Reynolds as he does on SNL. Catalina was a maid then later a stripper on My Name Is Earl.

@ryan7864,aweisti True. Seinfeld was not broad from the American perspective or even mainstream.  It's humor was like nothing we'd ever seen before. Larry David is unique and many Americans saw it as strange at first then it slowly gained an understanding.    Woody Allen is another who's humor is uniquely American but not widely appreciated. ,11년 전,1,

This is from someone who is not an American who has been a great fan of Seinfeld, Ray Ramano, Will smith, Kirsten Wiig and Jim in Living color etc. Forgot to mention the writers of Friends - wonderful.

People have earbuds in, are inhabiting a public space, and yet are oblivious to the living, breathing world around them. They behave as if they were in their bathroom.
