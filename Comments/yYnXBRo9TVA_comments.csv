@lucaklp,"I mean its not that crazy. People have been saying this for years, dating all the way back to the initial start of Nord Stream 2 (which was 2011 so in Obama's time) and even before that. Its obvious the US critizises it as its an oil and gas exporting nation itself, obviously you dont like the competition getting a direct link to export through.   I guess the biggest thing to consider is that Russian gas has been the cheapest (if thats of political nature or pure economics is a debate for another day) so increasing the capacities there made the most sense. Germany does realize tho that with an autocratic leader like Putin this can be weaponized. The important part of that is that the result is more expensive gas, not a total lack of gas. A lot of nations export oil and gas, they just dont go overboard to keep the prices higher. So if it were to be weaponized by Russia gas and oil would be more expensive for some time but not forever and Russia would be giving up its leverage for good as it would prove an unrealiable economic partner.   There's a lot more to it than just the superficial facts. If we use this same logic the entire world is dependent on China for aluminum. They produce like more than 90% of the worldwide supply. Now would it be a hassle and connected to costs if China were to cut aluminum exports? Yes. Would we collapse from it? No. Its always a financial and temporary thing, while being true to some degree..",3년 전,0,

@stephenvanbuskirk9681,One problem that is related to Trump's raking the forest is that since we've been stopping forest fires completely. Before we stopped all fires occasional forest fires cleared out the underbrush without getting  into the mature trees. Some cones won't drop their seed until a forest fire has cleared out the underbrush. Keeping the underbrush down  keeps fires from getting big enough to get up into the tops of large firs and redwoods. Now that we've been stopping all forest fires the thicker underbrush causes serious hotter fires that reach the tops of the trees.,4년 전,0,

One of the largest and most destructive forest fires to burned  near Glacier National Park in the early 1900's..it took 50 years for the forest on that area to regrow and become forest again...and different areas of the world have different conditions conducive to fighting fires..,4년 전(수정됨),0,

If we have the personell on scene, they will often maintain, or create a fire line by raking the floor of the wooded area, or sometime farmers clearing dead brush to avoid fire will call it raking.

There are many much more effective ways to deal with cartels than a wall which symbolises hatred towards the mexican population and would destroy many lives if trump would’ve managed to build it properly like he promised to his braindead fans.

@SipLeila," @boofman5370    Yes, they are connected and know about what they are doing because I have known them.  And in blue states the police are now so corrupt or ordered by Democrat leaders to do nothing about open drug sales on the streets.   So, you're lying or naive.  Conversations about people trying to turn in the drug dealers openly dealing has been on open forums.   And another thing - they send their money back to their real ""homes"" so they are draining the US of money.  They also get benefits while here such as food stamps for their children born here or Medicaid.  Those children should not have been born here and California voted in the 90's against any welfare for illegals.  So, the vast majority of Californians didn't like it. So, drug smuggling isn't the only problem.   And they bring lice to school which has even been in the newspapers is blue states. And now, harder drugs are commonly found among teens, like heroin.

@thetooginator153,"Trump’s remarks about forest management have some truth to them, but he is SO bad at articulating things, it sounds ridiculous.  The ground in California forests is flammable (even the dirt!) because organic matter has accumulated there for at least a hundred years.  Before modern fire suppression, there were SMALL forest fires every year in California, which burned the fuel on the ground.  However, global warming is also making summers longer and hotter, which makes fire suppression almost impossible.  If we want to avoid these massive fires in California, we need to stop global warming by using non-fossil based energy sources AND taking the first foot of topsoil (and dead trees and brush) from as much of California’s forests as possible.  These are MASSIVE and expensive undertakings, so, they probably won’t happen - especially when the president doesn’t even admit that global warming exists.  Trump doesn’t have the BASIC leadership skills required to get his base to adopt SIMPLE mitigation tools to reduce the spread of a lethal virus, he CERTAINLY doesn’t have the leadership skills to combat global warming.",5년 전,0,

@paulblake8664," @tptvox  Because all you do is accept what the joke media and medical people tell you, like a little sheep, so I become your reluctant teacher?   ...  1. The State is responsible for buying those ""Raking Blades"" that attach to tractors, ""Hello Duh! And they also receive Federal Aid, So DUH again! And he was talking to experts in the field who know exactly what he means! And the media fools probably knew what the President said, ""but hey, they see you as that dope that they manipulate!"" 2. COVID-19 preys on the very old and weak, the Obese, and those people being treated for existing disease(s).  3. So the vast majority of those 200,000 dead were very old and very sick people. And in the USA, 70% plus of our population is being treated for at least one incurable disease!  4. And the lockdown didn't help those old people at all... A fact that any MD with half a brain knew!!!...  5. But somehow that above fact escaped ""Fauci the expert Quack?"" And so the large numbers of COVID-19 infections and deaths came out of rest homes and their own homes (see ref below)? Why, because those most vulnerable to infectious diseases, were not protected, by Quack Fauci! 6. Note: Ms. Jackson, the question should be; why would President Trump not cut health care dollars when they are doing such a poor and deadly job? The 3rd worst disease in our healthcare system, is our health care system. Pushing its expense dramatically.. The death rate from medical mistakes is 1000 people daily, placing it; just below the deaths from Cancer and Heart disease (see ref)! ...

If u want to fight terrorism, as i agree with but, u can be smarter and use a more efective and faster way to get rid of the assholes that sneeks up and attacks us, War is like chess, and if u want to hit ur main target, do it from the inside. I know its hard to get infiltraitors , but its not impssible , when u destroy a wbole country and force people to flee their country, its never the US that has to deal with that, to clean up the caose they makes over and over again, specially aftef 9/11, it is we in europe that has to deal with the after math, some countries refuse to let refugeee come to them, we did not. We let so many victims of the war WE never even was a part of,  And after some time it was clear that we let to many refugees come to us, so no one could have a decent life, not the war victims/refugees, nor us , it went fast from easy to get an appartment even in small shitty towns  theres so few appartments so now u re just glad that u have a home, but to find a new place to live, u can forget that, in stockholm its been hard t get a place if u dont have a lot of cash , but in small towns, its never been an issue , before the USA let us in eu, clean up the mess, they are responsible for, amd the sadest part isnt that its hard to get a place to live, -the sadest parr is that, our goverment didnt seem to understand that, its not fair to the refugees or us, natives, to take on to many  rfugees cus the result is we havent the capacaty to offer so many people a good life here. Its not fair to them, who often ends up livin on the streets,  In my world thafs not ok. Best way is to let the right amount of people to come to us, so they can have a devent life here,  Rather then take on to many, sp  our economy canr cover, to let them have a decent life, and it as i mentioned, and its even hard for us natives to survive with lower income,  (im tired 😴and 🤒 so i dunno if anyone can understand what ive wrote, with the worst spelling ever, but with high fever and middle of the nite 😴 i tend to spell  so bad) cant keep my 👀 open, so its time for  me to fall asleep, But in 5 words i can say what i wish for and that is : US - ""stop with ur pax americana""",5년 전(수정됨),1,

@lucaklp,"People have been saying this for years, dating all the way back to the initial start of Nord Stream 2 (which was 2011 so in Obama's time) and even before that. Its obvious the US critizises it as its an oil and gas exporting nation itself, obviously you dont like the competition getting a direct link to export through.   I guess the biggest thing to consider is that Russian gas has been the cheapest (if thats of political nature or pure economics is a debate for another day) so increasing the capacities there made the most sense. Germany does realize tho that with an autocratic leader like Putin this can be weaponized. The important part of that is that the result is more expensive gas, not a total lack of gas. A lot of nations export oil and gas, they just dont go overboard to keep the prices higher. So if it were to be weaponized by Russia gas and oil would be more expensive for some time but not forever and Russia would be giving up its leverage for good as it would prove an unrealiable economic partner.   There's a lot more to it than just the superficial facts. If we use this same logic the entire world is dependent on China for aluminum. They produce like more than 90% of the worldwide supply. Now would it be a hassle and connected to costs if China were to cut aluminum exports? Yes. Would we collapse from it? No. Its always a financial and temporary thing, while being true to some degree..",3년 전,0,

@MarkESBuckmaster,"Clearly Trump is not an eloquent speaker and thus leaves himself wide open to ridicule. He doesn't have the ability to filter what he is thinking before it comes out of his mouth.  He's not a good politician because he can't control his mouth. He's a businessman, but unfortunately he's not a very good businessman either.  But this comedian is not that clever either. He ridicules Trump for calling the ground in the forest a floor. But that is the correct word, it is the forest floor. Perhaps the Finnish president didn't use the word rake but he probably was referring to keeping the forest floor clear of dry debris, to help prevent the outbreak of fires and certainly the use of rakes would be involved.  But just stop and think, you do at least have the freedom to mock and laugh at your President on TV. You just try that in Russia, China or North Korea and see what the consequences are and later this year you will have the opportunity to remove Trump from office.  Watching this video, all I see is a mediocre comedian getting laughs from his ability to mimic Donald Trump, something that hundreds of comedians around the can do, because it's so easy.",5년 전,0,

Please, do not judge all Americans by this president. For most of us we feel like we are going through a coup. This president was elected by corrupt means. We are doing everything we can to get him out in November. We have lost almost 200,000 people due to his negligence toward the coronavirus. Please don’t paint all of us with such a huge brush and generalize us all as one monster. Our leaders have betrayed us and are trying to squeeze as much as they can out of us. They do not follow our Constitution, they are blinded by their hubris and greed. And if you think you are suffering, it’s much worse being an American. Poor people have no work because of the pandemic so they can’t pay their rent and they are getting evicted and thrown in the street by the thousands. Never in our lives have we seen such cruelty, insanity and outright racism. We peacefully protest all over the country and right wing vigilantes come in from out of state and try to start violence and riots. Black people are in danger of losing their lives because of systemic racism in some of our police. The free press is being treated like criminals.

@tptvox,"Joy Ann El-Khouri Don’t believe a word that comes out of Trump’s mouth. I say this as an American. He is a narcissist, sociopathic, compulsive liar. He does not represent American citizens like myself and my husband, our family and friends. He does not follow our rule of law or our Constitution. He is probably the worst president elected...and we have had some doozies. But we have had good ones too. I worked on both of Obama’s campaigns. He was a real American President. This guy really is a criminal con man who panders to the Uber rich and other dictators. The people that follow him are either extremely wealthy and he gives them and their corporations big tax cuts so they vote for him. There are foreign countries that stand to gain more if trump is president so they hack our social networks and internet connections and put immense amounts of Trump’s lies and propaganda out there and people that don’t check if it’s the truth blindly follow it. And then we have the white supremacists and the conspiracy theorists with more lies like QAnon and Alex Jones. Then we have these televangelists that have turned Christianity on its head and preach that all liberals and Democrats are demons from Satan and must be destroyed. IT’S INSANE. Total Jim Jones Cult behavior. They don’t wear masks, they don’t social distance, they say the Pandemic is a hoax....it really is mind blowing.  But I say this with great certainty, much more Americans are NOT like this.  We LOVE Canada and Canadians. What is not to love. Since I was a kid , my folks had a house in Pender Harbour, BC, every summer and we loved it. We made so many friends there and had such great times. I was born in Seattle in the 1950s and we would go up to Vancouver to see Canadian parades and watch hockey and go fishing. You have a gorgeous country and the people are splendid and generous and kind. Please DO NOT take anything from this horrible man’s mouth as the way most Americans feel. Please.  I swear it feels like our country has been hijacked and part of it lives in a terrible alternate reality. I don’t know how he gets these people to be such cult followers. It’s like they are on drugs or have been brainwashed.  I apologize for any hateful thing that he has said about any Canadians. He is sick in the head.

And people have been saying this for years, dating all the way back to the initial start of Nord Stream 2 (which was 2011 so in Obama's time) and even before that. Its obvious the US critizises it as its an oil and gas exporting nation itself, obviously you dont like the competition getting a direct link to export through.   I guess the biggest thing to consider is that Russian gas has been the cheapest (if thats of political nature or pure economics is a debate for another day) so increasing the capacities there made the most sense. Germany does realize tho that with an autocratic leader like Putin this can be weaponized. The important part of that is that the result is more expensive gas, not a total lack of gas. A lot of nations export oil and gas, they just dont go overboard to keep the prices higher. So if it were to be weaponized by Russia gas and oil would be more expensive for some time but not forever and Russia would be giving up its leverage for good as it would prove an unrealiable economic partner.   There's a lot more to it than just the superficial facts. If we use this same logic the entire world is dependent on China for aluminum. They produce like more than 90% of the worldwide supply. Now would it be a hassle and connected to costs if China were to cut aluminum exports? Yes. Would we collapse from it? No. Its always a financial and temporary thing, while being true to some degree..",3년 전,0,

And knew better than biased journalists:  “In Finland, after clear-cutting a forest area, crews use heavy machinery (similar to what is used in this video) to “rake” or gather tree harvesting residues, tree roots and other material into huge piles. The biomass is then chipped onsite after it has dried up sufficiently, and chips are hauled to local heat-producing plants to generate warmth for local residents. ...   Finland manages theses forests for timber, wildlife, controlled fires – and protection of nearby homes and people. Its lessons can and should be applied elsewhere. President Trump understands that. His incomplete grasp of Finnish “raking” and other practices led to confusion and ridicule, but should not result in these principles and practices being rejected out of hand.”  https://wattsupwiththat.com/2018/12/12/trump-was-right-about-raking-finnish-forests/",5년 전,0,

@lucaklp,"Not really, its been talked about since like all the way back to the initial start of Nord Stream 2 (which was 2011 so in Obama's time) and even before that. Its obvious the US critizises it as its an oil and gas exporting nation itself, obviously you dont like the competition getting a direct link to export through.   I guess the biggest thing to consider is that Russian gas has been the cheapest (if thats of political nature or pure economics is a debate for another day) so increasing the capacities there made the most sense. Germany does realize tho that with an autocratic leader like Putin this can be weaponized. The important part of that is that the result is more expensive gas, not a total lack of gas. A lot of nations export oil and gas, they just dont go overboard to keep the prices higher. So if it were to be weaponized by Russia gas and oil would be more expensive for some time but not forever and Russia would be giving up its leverage for good as it would prove an unrealiable economic partner.   There's a lot more to it than just the superficial facts. If we use this same logic the entire world is dependent on China for aluminum. They produce like more than 90% of the worldwide supply. Now would it be a hassle and connected to costs if China were to cut aluminum exports? Yes. Would we collapse from it? No. Its always a financial and temporary thing, while being true to some degree..",3년 전,0,

For example I don't know if you've heard but Finland is the only country to ever pay their war reparations from WW2, that alone meant that most of the goods Finns produced went straight to the Soviets.   We also acted as a great buffer and a country to hold meetings in on truly neutral ground. We also were a great trade partner for the USSR.

Germany also would have gotten Kaliningrad ""Königsberg"" if it weren't for the US.

Hardly any Swedish university is ranked as world leading. Rather, the list of top global universities is dominated by American Universities. Go figure.

North Korea does not want war. They want survival, which they use threat of war to achieve. The US is currently isolationist and is avoiding aggression. Russia is currently in a cold war with the west, in which most would consider Russia the aggressor and in an open proxy war with Ukraine. Russia is constantly creating instability in wester countries, including false information campaigns, bribing politicians in Italy or manipulating elections in the US. It's goal is apparently to destabilise and paralyse the west, by exploiting the openness of western society, in order to gain the upper hand. The obvious reason is that Russia cannot confront the west directly militarily since it is inferior militarily. The idea that US is dependent on its allies is ridiculous. It's almost entirely the other way around.

First i came here being kind of neutral with Sweden and America but when i read all of these i went 100% to swedish side. You seem to have too much free time, you really should go get some fun hobby so you could do that instead of arguing in youtube. And little things like three point seatbelts makes a big difference. Three point seat belt is much safer and without three point seatbelts there would probably be no 4 nor 5 point seatbelts. It would mean that airplanes would be lot more limited. Stuff like aircraft carriers for jets couldn't basiallicly exist. And if you know aircraft carriers are maybe the most powerful military weapons that US has and it gives lot more power for US navy.

Didn't the US government deny the very existence of the virus? Significance is subjective and is only used for propaganda. Everlasting world peace is highly unlikely, still it is something every country should try to accomplish or the next WW is just around the corner. I understand geopolitics, thank you. But unlike you, I see the different sides of the story because I read German, British, American and even French news. So your accusations are baseless and hilarious. The US is avoiding aggression? That makes me laugh. So starting trade wars with China and the EU, extending the war in Afghanistan and threaten multiple countries is not considered aggression anymore? I know Russia is far from perfect but the US is supposed to be better? The US always tried to remove governments that didn't like them, whether through war or assassination etc. The truth is, Russia is in a cold war with the US, since the relations between the EU and Russia have improved, allthough the Crimea annexation is still not acceptable. And Russia had help from the inside in the last election, a lot of Trumps campaigning buddies were quite friendly to Russia. Without this cooperation the Russians would have been barely brave enough to meddle. So instead of just accusing Italy of Corruption, you can point the finger back to the US. No alliance has lasted forever, maybe Nato won't last that much longer either. And if you ask me, the military spending of Nato is already to high, considering that Nato almost spends the same on its military as the rest of the entire world combined. If that's not provoking, I don't know what is. Europe is focusing mainly on its economy and maybe a little bit of defense and I think it's enough for now. An example would be Germany that is actually not supposed to have a big military after WW2 but still is being pressured from the US in spending more on its military and actually use it, allthough it's only supposed to be used for defense. And maybe part of the reason Europe isn't spending the promised amount of money is because it wasn't so much a suggestion as a demand and as I've mentioned before, the EU is not a vassal to the US. I actually know about the problem with China and their neighbors in the East Asia sea. But considering that the US doesn't respect Canada for their claims about the water around their own islands and just sees it as ""international trade route"" or something like that, how is that better?

Trade wars are not considered aggression, just because they have the word ""war"" in them. Duh. The US is withdrawing from Afghanistan and mostly everywhere. Not sure who you mean threatened; though any significant power must assert itself. If you don't see why the US is different from Russia then you have a tremendous amount to learn. Both Russia and the US removed non-friendly governments in order to further their own interests. It's politics, which I thought you understood. You actually believe Russia has good relations with Europe? Jesus. How badly informed are you? Russia is in a cold war with Europe. How do you know how ""brave"" the Russians would have been? And how is that relevant? Its bs. I should point the finger at the US instead of blaming Italy for corruption? Makes no sense. The Russians paid bribes to the Italian government. Thats a fact. Read the news. Nice to hear that you think Europe's defense spending is ""enough for now"", but it's an arbitrary statement. Most NATO countries spend very little as a % of GDP, which is how defense costs are compared. Not in absolutes. Duh. Yes, Germany is pressured by the US to keep its promises. How strange. Europe is not a vasall? uhmmmm...you are supposed to keep promises and honor agreements, aren't you? Right? Keeping promises does not make you a ""vasall"" (seriously?) but a reliable partner. Not keeping promises makes you unreliable. Duh. You don't even need to read the news to know that. Not even in five different languages.

@blueangel4ever370," @hefnasty99  First things first. Your arrogance is only suggesting that you are not willing to see different opinions. I never imagined to have to defend the fact that I have an opinion, and seriously ""Good"" and ""bad"" opinions? You say I'm uniformed, I could say you are a victim of propaganda, that doesn't help the discussion. You want to talk about kindergarten? You lash out at anyone who doesn't agree with you, just like the US. You only represent one side of a story and still act as you know everything. I consider a trade war an aggression, not just because of the word ""war"". It damages relationships and therefore I see it as an aggression. If the US doesn't see that, they will regret experimenting with the relations of their allies. The threats of the US mostly include sanctions and they kind of get old, especially considering that China and the EU can do exactly the same. Prohibiting Europeans from the US was and is ridiculous, considering that they are now the leader in terms of Corona infected. And that's their own fault, Donald Trump didn't prepare and was in denial, now the US deals with the consequences. I see Russia and the US as threats because one of these two countries will probably start WW3. And yes, Germany is finishing the Russian gas pipeline, as you said, the Italians are improving relations with them, the Russians helped Boris Johnson rise to power and the French have already questioned Nato and wanted to improve relations, too. Are that enough examples? The US election system is old and has barely been improved, now some states (swing states) are more important than others, so much for equality. You want to talk about reliable? Try to find out more about the history of the US, the best example to start with could be Mount Rushmore. And if Germany pays more for its military, France and the UK will become suspicious, so sorry if the relationship with our neighbors is more important than to the US. And you don't seem to know how countries see the US. The US loves to push and pressure countries into submission, that is not how you treat allies, sorry. And you want to talk about more examples? How about the most recent news? The US is stealing respirators from Canada, France and Germany. How ""reliable"" is that? You should face the fact that the international community doesn't trust your government, it is one of the least stable and reliable governments that has ever existed. I know that you want me to be quiet, so the old and ""wise"" generation can solve problems like the environmental crisis but since this is also my future, I won't. I demand the most basic thing, respect for my opinion and respect for other countries. There is a difference between being proud of your country or thinking that it is superior to others. The US is showing signs of autocracy, such as glorifying its history, attacking the opposition (in and outside of the ruling party) and isolation (allthough that can have more than one reason). Last but not least you should watch your tone as I still see many good things about the US, I have many relatives there and I believe the US and its allies can have a bright and successful future.

Trump runs the US like a family business, his relatives and friends are in high positions, he's ignoring the senat as much as possible. There are speculations that one of his children will run for president in 2024, not to mention the ones that he sexually assaulted women or that Russia helped him.

Sadam successfully prevented Islamic fundamentalism to thrive in his country. America's treatment of Islamic people resulted in angry, resentful young people who were easily radicalised. Bush was warned that stigmatising Muslims would also result in the radicalisation of young people living in the west. The outcome of the war on terror was the radicalisation of many more people. Many European countries have better standards of living than America. I don't know how you judge significance but I would prefer high quality education and health care for all, than a large army.

Trump is destroying the tenants of democracy in America. It is deeply sad to watch. Hopefully he will get voted out.  As to history America refused to back the British government against the Nazi.

If that is true, it must then also have been impossible for them to support Finland during WW2.  If you understood geopolitics you would realise that relations with the Soviets, whom the west was allied with against the Germans, were much more important than Finland. So of course they could not sabotage Soviet interests by supporting Finland. That is just the reality of being a small country: you are often unimportant and ignored.

@John-V9," @hefnasty99  Greetings from Greece, we are expecting all the ""thanks"" you 'll receive for the democracy that you claim the U.S. preserved in Europe as without the ancient Greeks you would be living in feudalism (according to your logic), although in modern days, you actually do and don't even know or care about it. Also, we are expecting your ""thanks"" about almost everything that has to do with science, education, medicine, art, politics, philosophy, athletics etc. You know, all those things that were conceived thousands of years ago and you are using them without even showing your gratitude. Now I know, we are a small country (the size of Sweden approximately) but we have a lot to show. SIZE matters only to those that have NOTHING else to show.   Military prowess is not a factor on country significance, an entirely stupid concept as every little corner of the world has its significance. Army size matters only to the unwilling to die for what they stand for. When people are fighting for their home (something that the U.S. soldiers never had to do) they tend to sacrifice everything, like in Vietnam, where peasants took up arms to protect their homes and families from the invading force. That's what the U.S. has always been, an invader. To the eyes of the world, the U.S. is the ""bad guy"" yet your indoctrination is so extreme that you and your fellow citizens actually think that you are liberating countries.  Especially about the WW2 debate, I would urge you to look up the ""Battle of Crete"" to see how one battle, as insignificant as you might think, turned the entire war, forcing the outcome. Now, I don't claim that Greece ""won"" WW2 (we actually lost it as we suffered the most casualties without any reparations up to this day) but we played a much bigger part than the U.S. with its enormous army that waited until Pearl Harbor was bombed to join in. To be honest, it was to be expected as we had to fight for our homes/families etc. (and we are used to it as Persians/Romans/Ottomans/Italians/Germans and many more fully know) while the U.S. soldiers acted as mercenaries so far away from home. They wouldn't die in vain. We had to. We wanted to. You see, here in Greece, we don't thank anyone for their service in the army. We all serve for a period of time. Our army is not optional or mercenary. When we had to wage war, even though those under the age of 45 were the first to be called upon, the guideline has always been ""anyone, capable of handling a firearm, fights"".  Lastly, about the laughing stock of the world... The U.S. are now number one, as Trump made you number one in no time and keeps you there every time he opens his mouth, followed closely only by North Korea. None compare to you two.  P.S. Judging by some of your comments (the unfounded and delusional ones), I hope that you are a misinformed proud American and not an orange turd fanatic.

@soundhill1,"""forest floor"" is a recognised term. You are trying to create a perception by the aspersion of leaf raking. Trump did not mention leaves. Very large agricultural rakes exist and even bigger ones can be developed. Australian Aborigines protect forests by burning forest floor material early in times when the fires  will not singe the tree canopies. Except European settlers in the 1800s got rid of many of them  and stopped others  doing it. Also they burned the gardens the Aborigines were protecting from fire. Now follow the Australian news to see what is happening there.",5년 전,1,

@davidmccallum8172," Vicki McCune  Trump, is the door stop, against those that serve pure evil. A delay, in the timeline  of destruction that by now, would otherwise have brought yet another massive war, sponsored by  the globalists SAD or Special Activities Division of the CIA and the most evil woman on earth.  Hitlery Rotten Jezebel Clinton and Bill, whose body count is extreme, and foundation are equally  extremely corrupt.  Here is an example of her evil;  https://youtu.be/Nz-3cqCzBQw  &  https://youtu.be/8xvvpn76AHg Since Susan has informed Trump of the 21 Trillion, he intends to make use of it, along with oil income,  to return SEVEN fold to all that has been stolen by the deep state.  The thefts have taken place over 37 years under the last five US presidents. There are already over 37,000 arrested pedogate types, headed for military style tribunal, a format  used after WWII against the Nazi's. Trump, is surrounded by them, and is missing in things like the dangers of FIVE -G, the toilet to tap water recycling systems, and the dangers of intermediate Russian made ICBM nukes  that fly at 7,000  MPH, and are danger close as to the launch points already prepared, to be flown in when wanted.   The USA has level 10 Tesla weapons, but Trump doesn't know it, as these have no congressional  oversight,and are in black projects, like a lot of the underground facilities. You are going to see both  Hitlery and that Obomination, end up in prison for Treason, and ...both Bush 41 who created OMEGA,  the globalist structure to control all intel, and John McCain, were executed for treason. This is not  known by the public.  The DEMS are painted into a corner. No harm will come to Trump, and he will win by a landslide in 2020.  He will also end up replacing five corrupted US supreme court justices, and at the federal level, the  ROE VS WADE decision will be overturned, reverting to states decision on abortion. That... steals power from these evil globalists that have been against him from the start.   They also need billions to maintain their secret programs, and that money is drying up. No more use of  the Petro Dollar, of which is 30% of the US economy, that will be used to support the military industrial  complex,and companies like Lockheed Martin, that washes money for her.  It was Ben Rich at his retirement party from his CEO job at Lockheed, that unzipped his pants, telling  people things like, we have the technologies to return ET home.  In case you don't know, that means Siris B in Orions belt. That's where the demonic aliens in the flesh  are from, and have been beneath the earth for more years than you can imagine.",5년 전,0,

Castro takes over in Cuba and 10's of thousands of Cubans immigrate to the USA. They are distributed across the nation so they will not be a negative impact to South Florida. Then the Cubans see Miami as their mecca and in mass relocate to Miami. As a fire fighter I was denied 2 promotions to Captain even though I am a Vietnam era veteran and cannot be promoted because of federal consent decrees. Haitian and Latins were given preferential treatment in promotions. After the second time being denied promotions I changed from being a Democrat to being a Republican because the Democratic party could care less about white Caucasian males. Miami-Dade County is now 70% Latin. Good luck finding a job there if you are a white Causation male even if you can speak Spanish or Creole.

@IanWhiddett," @girliejax  I agree. Bush Sr. and F.L. Barbara Bush were a conservative breed that we don't see often anymore. They had friends across both party lines, were diplomatic and could compromise. I've changed my mind about Bush W. in the past few years. The loss of American lives for oil profit unfortunately can't be undone but in reality he was the puppet of Carl Rove and Dick Cheney but he did at least consult the heads of all the departments in his cabinet and didn't compromise the integrity of our national security by undermining our intelligence agencies on television (yikes) or on Twitter (double yikes). It's been interesting to see the relationship amongst the former presidents - Carter, Bush Sr. (before passing), Clinton, Bush W. and Obama when they gather on a regular basis. Politics aside, they obviously all get along very well and respect one another. Quite entertaining when they've been at the White House and various events with Trump present... They clearly do not accept him, and can't help but smirk and laugh at him - and who could blame them? I agree anybody but Trump will do.

I still don’t know how after he caused 35.000’s more deaths than necessary (currently 40.000 which could’ve been 5.000) he is still the president. The only country who has almost 1 million patients, even China where the virus started has around 80.000. While Trump was busy laughing at Europe and laughing at China, the corona spread. He even called it “the hoax of the democrats”. Everyone in the crowd cheered for him... but look at him now, look at the USA now. Now more broken than ever lol. Health care exposed, worst president exposed (if that wasn’t obvious already) and racism in USA also exposed.   A lot people say USA is accepting, but never in my life have I seen more racism in the USA than anywhere else. They keep hating Mexicans illegals and all sorts of refugees. Black people suffer the most, a lot more from corona as well because racism is active in education and work. Black people (most ‘m) are being ‘kept’ poor because of the system and racism. Most of the people don’t have enough money to go to a decent school and don’t have the same job and educational opportunities as a white person (especially male). Most public jobs are occupied by black people, more black people get corona virus. They can’t pay health insurance or any hospital treatment and die from it. If they do go to the hospital, their economic problems will get worse and worse since their health care sucks, so they’ll have to pay thousands of dollars. Racism obviously still active in the USA, so don’t ever tell me you’re te most open country because you are not.   Cuomo or Obama FOR PRESIDENT!",5년 전,6,

In fact, ""coal digging"" in Australia is so perfect and  clean that their ""diggers"" don't get ""that disease that some American coal diggers"" get.  Trump rambled on and on about how great and how healthy the ""digging"" business is in Australia, saying it's not like that here, then repeatedly emphasized how some of our ""diggers"" would get sick from ""that disease.""  He would not shut up.  He went on and on for 15-20 minutes repeating the same words over and over.  REALLY??  He couldn't take 5 minutes away from hate tweeting to learn the correct and very simple terminology on common words used in the industry.  So what was the point?  He didn't set up a committee or group to visit Australia to study its mining techniques or learn how to clean up our own coal industry and put safety practices into place.

One example -  Fracking with lethal chemicals - is ignored on a humanly-irresponsible scale in the U.S. today. Why?

@dr.redpill353,"@Astra's bontastic wakfu shenanigans  So if somebody lends Greece a whole bunch of money does that make them free or? Or they now slaves to the debt is well? As far as your criticisms of American capitalism now being more corporatism I actually agree with you. The biggest problem is country ever had was the influx of the ""Democratic Party"" and of course pay for play capitalism through the Republican party. You're right it is a corporate- tocracy and as such it is less than ideal capitalism.  However right now globally  given any alternatives The United States is definitely the best place to live. This year alone we had literally tens of thousands of small business start UPS and in the last 3 years we've had something along the lines of I 65% success rate of new business start ups.  Europe by comparison well… doesn't compare. Nor does any heavily socialized state.  I don't know if you see it on the news in the country that you live we don't see it on the news generally speaking in the United States but globally right now there are about 50 countries that were all formally identified as socialist States that are now in complete collapse where their citizenry are in open revolt against their government. It's not just in Hong-Kong it's not just in France it's all over the world period from Argentina to Uruguay too many other countries all around the world that used to be considered socialist or socialist dictatorships or Communist countries all of them are in total collapse.  Obviously if you have a societee socialism is the base structure of all societee. But to make it a form of government is stupid because human nature cannot be governed that way. And I will only use every single example of socialist government as the examples that I'll call upon to make that point.  In the United States we have all forms of social programs all of them every last one of them is supported by in paid for by a capitalist  democracy.  The more socialist you make your state i.e. The more control the government has over daily life the less functional the economy becomes as evidenced by Canada's 70% tax rate.  If it weren't for the United States artificially propping up the Canadian economy by buying its goods in allowing our goods to be built there Canada would have collapsed 15 years ago.  The USMC a agreement to be signed I think to day or this week is evidence of everything I just said if it weren't for the United States using its capitalist might not only would the nazis have conquered all of Europe and kept it and World War II but Mexico in Canada would now be giant parking lots filled with empty buildings and starving people. So you can make all the jest in jokes about the United States that you want but if you live in Europe you live under an iron umbrella created by an provided by the United States of America which created and kept European sovereignty despite the fact that other people want it take it. And they called themselves socialists or nationalist socialists and now as a thank you Europe is slowly dying the death of socialist bureaucracy.

Therefore, the United States began to use barbaric power to attack other countries, such as launching a siege of Iran with US military and financial hegemony, and launching a siege of China with the high-tech of the United States, if Iran is not afraid of US military and financial threats, the United States  It will surely go bankrupt to Yiwei.

In USA violence or the threat of violence needs to be involved with penetration while in Denmark rape is defined by how the victim feels. It is much more easier to punish and incarcerate people of rape that is not even close to penetration.,5년 전,1,

@Joe-sm7lm," @zCREz  If there has been a rise in all the crimes that you mention and if this can be attributed to the immigrants, then surely the question to ask is:  ""Why are the immigrants committing these crimes?"".  If you do, you will find that there are real socio-economic reasons.   Firstly, these people have been violently displaced in their home countries by conflict (which they, rightly, blame on the west);  they are scorned in the countries to which they have fled;    not only have they lost everything but they have little chance of re-building their lives.  From your privileged position, you might not understand this but if you were suffering like these people, you might also turn to violence to vent your frustrations.   Put yourself in their shoes....if you can.",6년 전,0,
@zCREz,"​ @Joe-sm7lm  I haven't said anyhting that would be close to such a claim that all muslims are extremists, not even the majority of muslims. An alarming number of refugees (not all) migrating to europe however, are in fact extremists and/or terrorists. Many (again, not all) muslims aren't even dissociating themselves from beliefs that would be considered extremist in western society (we even have sharia laws in sweden now, thanks to politicians literally cooperating with islamist organizations). Do keep in mind that less than 10% of germans were nazis, and we all know what they accomplished.   Oh i'm pretty sure Isis wouldn't agree that ""other muslims"" are real muslims (not all muslims. just to make it clear, so that you can't put more words in my mouth).

Good thing you mentioned it or i'd keep ranting about how terrorists are flowing through EU borders while people like you are blaming white people for the existence of terrorism while keep believing islam is the religion of peace (for the record, i loathe all religions). You're literally telling muslims that their beliefs are wrong, that's racist.",6년 전,0,
@Joe-sm7lm," @zCREz  You just don't get it!!   I could mention ANY religion to make the point that religious fanatics can use their ""holy"" book to justify their actions.  The Crusaders did that in medieval times.  ISIS is doing that today.   That raises doubt, in my mind, whether they are true followers of their religion.  For that reason, I believe ISIS is not the true followers of Islam.   If that is being ""racist"", then I think you need to brush up your English!   Secondly, you still seem to equate those people ""flowing through EU borders"" as being terrorists.   Don't let your reasoning be dictated by your fear.     Thirdly, the question you must ask yourself is:-    Why are these people flocking to western countries in the first place.   It is largely because of the domestic conflict that is being fuelled b y the west.  The latest example is Venezeula where America and her stooges like Britain have openly opposed the sitting  president in favour of the opposition.    The net result:-  Millions of Venezeulans have fled (and are fleeing) the country.   Then, Trump wants to build a wall to keep them out of America!!

@samintra.b,"What I have read do far in this comment section is just .... Well: I can understand people pointing out the fact that there are in fact a lot of problems in Sweden and Paris that Trump could have been referencing. But I think that for a predident, using this vague method of pointing out problems does nothing than create confusion on the matter. If he wants to point out or reference real problems then he should explicitly state them. The way he is doing it now could be applied to any kind of situation. It's like saying ""And Britain did you hear about that? "" while thinking about the latest football game and letting others interpret it as a terror attack or me talking about Brexit. ""Paris is no longer Paris"" could mean anything. That the hostel his friend stayed in, has closed ect.  Similary when using (maybe) technical terms such as raking the forest floor, just have the mind to use them correctly or paraphrase them for others. If he truly meant looking for forest fires ect. he should not have used misleading vocabulary. That is the least someone should be able to expect of a politician, no matter what his/her/their views are. And lastly: All this does not excuse his blatant stating that Germany will be/is dependent on Russia if they do not change their program. Germany has just achived an extremely high percentage of green energy supply without ever losing any kind of foothold economically or energy wise. I really have no idea what he is talking about.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

Then making it to bottom and every 2 sec hearing loud thuds you still haven't forgotten from bodies hitting the ground in front of you, or how about getting out and looking and not seeing the building that stood there as long as you can remember then looking down and having to walk over a woman that just hit the ground that was almost 8 mo pregnant that when she hit her baby and body exploded like a watermelon hitting the ground.

He's trying to fix things and I have to say, I'm pleasantly surprised that he's able to get anything done with the sore losing left, blocking him at every turn, regardless of the issue. Years ago, Obama said we needed a border wall, nobody objected. Now, everybody's got a problem with this wall, all the same people that are ON TAPE saying we need border protection, are all opposed to it now. Why? Cuz Trump wants it. It's childish games. Everybody that voted for him, even reluctantly, are pleased with his performance. Sure, Obama was a smooth talking, charismatic, more presentable type, but he did nothing but hurt us.  Hillary, under Obama's administration, with his approval, sold 20% of our uranium to Russia. ? Ok? Then Putin and Trump meet and they looked like they had a mutual respect for one another AND THE LEFT GOES CRAZY, they want Trump to start a war with Russia. But if Russia was still the enemy since the Cold War, why sell them uranium just the year before? So much hypocrisy. Trump enforces the law at the border, law that was enacted during and BY OBAMA, unfortunately, if you go rob a bank with a little kid, guess what, they have to take the kid away from you. They don't allow you to go to jail with your children. PERIOD. Crossing the border, ilegally, will cause family separation. CNN showed kids in cages, everybody wanted to kill Trump.

I was disappointed in Germany after they closed down many Nuclear self sufficient self sustaining power plants in favour of fossil fuel powered ones all because of Fukushima. The odds on a 7.2 in the middle of Europe is so remote it's laughable. However in the ""west"" as he refers to it, they are NOT becoming more independent on their own energy supplies, fracking merely knackers up their environment and only delays the effects of Hubbert's Peak rather than being isolated from it.

I don't know, in all likelihood I'm giving him way too much credit.  On a somewhat related note, during the past summer here in Sweden the airforce tested out attempting to put out a controlled forest fire by bombing it. Kind of worked from what I heard. I guess either the shockwave did it, or they used a fuel air bomb to deprive it of oxygen. No idea if this is a new thing or just something they heard about and tried out, but still.

You are mystified because you are a millenial snowflake who only listens to CNN, lives in a coastal major metropolitan, and everyone you know is a liberal Democrat. In your bubble, Trump's world view doesn't make sense. Like when he goes to meet Kim Jong Un, who is shooting missiles over Japan. Yeah, Kim Jong is a nutjob and a murderer, but Trump knew to calm him down by making him feel he's a big man, and recognized on the world stage as a player. Trump arranged for him to get his own McDonald's, that made Kim happy. He stopped with the missiles. Dennis Rodman was pissed Obama never paid attention to Kim Jong, and was glad Trump finally made him feel heard. Trump's street smarts won in diplomacy, where Obama never could. The media just ripped Trump for buddying up to a mass murderer. Might have murdered a lot more if he'd shot a loaded missile at Japan, or us. The liberal mindset refuses to understand common sense like that.",6년 전,0,

@jay-fr4ds,"matt lehnardt The main problem that millennials, and my parents, have with Trump is not the things he is doing, but what he is saying. Trump has proven himself to be an embarrassment to the United States through his crude statements and inability to discuss anything with an audience without sounding like he has no clue what he is talking about. Yes, it’s great that he met with Kim Jong-un, and I actually applaud him for that, but it doesn’t change the fact that I feel embarrassed to have a president who presents himself in such a disgusting way. If he behaves like a respectable human being and been able to explain himself more, he might have actually had a lot more support. However, that is not the case and until he changes as a person, people will always hate him. This does not mention my annoyance with his blatant disregard for the environment and the dumb idea to “build a wall” to separate the US from Mexico, which I still think is the most basic, doomed-to-fail attempt to keep illegal immigrants out. He avoids logic like the plague, so of course no one would understand what the hell he is thinking.",6년 전,1,
@jay-fr4ds,"matt lehnardt First of all, I never once mentioned in that comment ANYTHING about Obama, so I’m not entirely sure why you pulled that entire rant about him out of your ass. Second, I never said anything hinting that I believe illegal immigrants should just be allowed to stroll into the U.S. openly. I stated that the simple idea of just a wall is doomed-to-fail, which when it comes to an entire southern border being protected by one, really does seem like a flop. I think if people actually sat down to talk like adults about logical ways to keep illegal immigrants out of the United States, a wall would be the last thing on the list. Also, using a small sample to give proof of success for such a large country is simply not enough. It’s like saying that because pimple cream works on people in Nebraska, it will work on everyone in the United States. I understand your grievances with other cultures that happen to have had some bad examples, and yeah this world isn’t all sunshine and rainbows, but that is no excuse to run towards only one of the many solutions that could be made. Not only that, but it takes time and patience to find the right formula for every country, and I don’t think anyone has gotten it down perfectly, but I just don’t believe that Trump is going about it in a smart way and in the process is ruining the reputation of the United States. I plan to travel a lot and I would like people to be excited about an American visiting rather than receive a look of sympathy or disdain. Lastly, I respect that you have your opinion, but I kindly advise that you actually listen to other points of view because someone might have the right answer someday and we might be too deaf to hear it. :)",6년 전,1,
@mattlehnardt8035,"walls are doomed to fail? says you? Yuma Arizona built 65 miles of wall between Mexico, and their crime problem dropped 95%. Did your media report on that? mine did. I mention Obama because if you are going to rant on Trump, you might want to know Obama did the same things, the only thing that saved him was scripting and teleprompters. If a wall is so crazy, why did Bill Clinton already built 670 miles of it in the 1990s? Did you know that? Its the big metal thing Jim Acosta is standing next to, saying how peaceful everything is down by the border. Duh. Also, I didn't use any profanity at you. I see your standards are lower.

@jay-fr4ds,"matt lehnardt This will be my last response because it’s clear you only like to read about half of something before responding to it. Also, I love your assumption that I am dedicated to the democratic party even though I’m not. Not sure about your point on curse words considering “ass” is used to describe none other than your ass (in case you don’t understand what that means, it is the same thing as your “butt” or “buttocks,” which is located just below the lower back). Also, I am well aware that Obama was not the best president to exist, which is why I didn’t say anything about him. If I had said something to indicate that, your rant would have made sense, but it still does not. You already brought up Yuma Arizona and I definitely addressed that point, but thank you for mentioning it again for absolutely no reason. I also never mentioned taking anything from media because whether it’s your media or mine, they both pull biased evidence to support their own side. For how much you seem to hate false reporting, it’s surprising to see how much you believe in media at all. As for Bill Clinton, no one ever said whether that was a good decision or not either, so your point is again, invalid. I tried very hard in my last comment to end on a kind note and be respectful of your opinion, so I don’t appreciate you throwing more anger in my face again. The least I can say is that people like you are the reason people can’t get along in this world.

@Sykoorus,trump is correct you need forest management.,6년 전,0,
@Joe-yr1em,"There are many reasons for the fires. One being, we need to let our forest fires burn. When we don't allow forest fires to happen, organic material builds up on the forest and when it eventually does burn, it burns so hotly that it ends up destroying the topsoil and the trees. These trees in California have evolved to withstand certain temperatures of forest fires but these current fires are burning much hotter than ever and this destroys trees that have historically withstood the heat. Also in California, the winds are very powerful and allow the fires plenty of fuel to spread very rapidly. Finally, climate change has also played a part in increasing the severity of the fires. The heat has created more dry material that acts as kindling for the flames.  If we want to stop the fires: 1) Let more forest fires burn 2) clear excessive dry brush 3) reduce our carbon footprint.",6년 전,0,

@frank124c, Frank August  Building a wall makes no sense. Look at the Great Wall of China. It was supposed to keep the Mongols out. It didn't work!

The Maginot Line didn't work  nor did the Berlin wall.  The figures you cite may well be lying since all those jobs are at MacDonald's and similar places even though the people holding those jobs are in many instances college graduates. Try holding a minimum wage job  and paying off your college tuition loans at the same time.

However, after Obama, either of the Bush presidents, most of us Americans love our President, our First Lady & the rest of the Trump family. Maybe President Trump isn't perfect but he's way better than Merkel, Trudeau, Macron or any other leader I know of around the World. If you can show me a better Leader, by all means please speak up. Anyone who believes we'd have been better off with Killary, needs to have their head examined. One only needs to look at the ""Yellow Vest Riots"" & foreigners shouting, ""We want Trump"" to realize he's the only leader that cares about his country and it's people. So, anyone that doesn't like it here, I'd like to know where in this World there is a better Leader. Every other country has sold their Citizen's down the river, or to the NWO Agenda. Traitors to their own people. We'd be just like Europe, Canada & every third world country, or definitely well on our way, had Hillary gotten the Presidency. She was selling our Country out as Secretary of State & too many of our citizens we're to uninformed or ignorant to see it. Anyone who seriously believes we'd have been better with Hillary or Bernie Sanders has their head in the sand. This time in history is a ""Yuge"" (pun intended) turning point  for humanity. We are right on the brink of the Satanic One World Order. I don't know if the ""people"" can change this, at this point in time. I think there is no turning back now. Every free country in history that has been infiltrated by the Islamic religion has become a third world country, losing their freedoms, including freedom of religion. I pray European countries, Canada & the U.S.  rise up against the United Nations and treasonous Leaders and defend their God given freedoms and take back their countries. So, maybe our President doesn't understand the maintenance of thining forests, clean up, but he doesn't have to know everything. Name One person that does. He's doing a damn Great job for the Citizens of America, & most of us love him, are very glad we voted for him & we'll vote for him again. So, go ahead & poke fun, we know he's a Great man & We, the people love him & we're Proud to call him Our President.  He's the best President we've had since John F Kennedy.

@lp3860," @johnnyhorowitz6669  Well, seeing I'm from Finland and have lived in both Germany and Sweden as well, I can take this one. First, stop watching Fox News. It's true that the influx of new immigrants will always lead to some issues, especially when these are people coming from wartorn countries. First thing that would help on that would be if the World Police would stop invading counries with no reason and not killing six figures worth of civilians while doing so. I know it's the War on terror, but I didn't know it was supposed to increase terrorism. So good job by you. Maybe EU should bomb the crap out of Latin America and see how well you deal with the issue.  But if you look at the total deaths by terrorism in Europe, it's lower now than in the 80's. In fact, there are less than 200 terrorism related deaths per year in the whole of Europe. How is America doing with that gun control thing of yours? Numbers and facts are annoying for people who are talking out of their ass.  Furthermore, not once in my 40+ years have I had a single issue with immigrants. Now local drunks and drug addicts who hang around in the city centre is a much bigger problem. Also European countries would be smart to not put these immigrants to the worst neighbourhoods, where people don't work and abuse the welfare system every change they get. That is a much bigger problem in Finland.  And trying to spin that Trump knew about forest management and he accidentally said the wrong thing is giving too much credit to a total idiot.

@Torsteen-p3d," @TuomasRoin  Suurin osa suomen metsistä on käytännössä koskematonta, metsänhoitoa harjoitetaan ainoastaan paikoissa joissa on metsätaloutta, ja metsät raivataan ja risusavottaa harjoitetaan siksi, että tulee parempaa puutavaraa ja kyseenomainen puutavara on myös helpompi saada pois metsästä. Olen kuitenkin kasvanut perheessä, joka harjoittaa metsätaloutta. Koko elämäni aikana, satojen raivausten yms. yhteydessä en koskaan ole kenenkään kuullut sanovan että sillä on yhtään mitään tekemistä metsäpalojen torjumisen kanssa, koska sillä ei ole. Ei ole väliä onko metsä luonnollinen vai hyvin hoidettu talousmetsä, metsäpalo leviää tuulesta riippuen silti puusta toiseen periaatteessa samaa tahtia. Mutta, kuten sanoin, Suomessa metsäpalojen torjunta on suunniteltu ja toteutetaan paljon paremmin kuin Ruotsissa, koska metsäteollisuus ei ole siellä läheskään yhtä suuressa merkityksessä eikä sitä siis turvata samalla tavalla.   Asia, joka Suomessa eniten hidastaa metsäpalojen leviämistä ovat metsätiet, joita on joka paikassa. (Maastopalo ei pääse hiekkateiden yli ilman epätävallisen kovaa tuulta) sekä metsäteollisuuden jättämä hakkuuaukiot, joista puut ja risut on kaadettu kokonaan pois. Tämän lisäksi suomen luonto on myös erilainen kuin esim. Ruotsissa, sillä täällä on paljon enemmän järviä, jokia ja suomaata jotka luonnollisesti pilkkovat metsää pienempiin osiin valtavien hiekkatieverkostojen ohella,  Enkä ole tässä mistään ""ottanut nokkiini"", satun vain tietämään että jätkällä on faktat ihan väärin päin.",6년 전,2,

The last IPCC fiasco where they had to fudge the data to make it seem as if higher temps were recorded can't be referenced. Where is the data on Earth's average temp?  Not hotter, not drier, and idiots like Meyers don't even study data on the earth's temps, do they?  The North Polar ice cap is shrinking!  Uh, yes, but the South Polar ice shield is a record levels.  Hmmm...  Even NASA's latest report says the earth is just slightly cooler than it was about 500 years ago.  Another FACT, while I'm rambling on here, is that CO2 is NOT a ""greenhouse gas"".   Not at all. Never was, never could be. It is completely transparent to IR radiation. The only prevalent ""greenhouse gas"" is water vapor. Ever notice how when it's overcast the radiational cooling is almost nonexistent?    Let's not repeat lies about how ""man-made climate change"" nee ""global warming"" is causing the California ""wildfires"" that are not burning any trees.  The real raping of the earth is caused by Big Oil and all the horrible, toxic spinoffs of its refinements.  Toxic pesticides, Big Pharma drugs, plastics that don't biodegrade are killing this planet. It all could be reversed in a few decades if hemp were used. Endlessly renewable, resistant to insects and biodegradable, it could be used for paper, food, building materials, and fuel. Hemp would add oxygen to the air, and need not be rotated with other crops. Medicine as well could be made from this miracle plant.  I want to add one thing: Conspiracies are what move the world.

It mainly consists of shed vegetative parts, such as leaves, branches, bark, and stems, existing in various stages of decomposition above the soil surface. Although principally composed of non-living organic material, the forest floor also teems with a wide variety of fauna and flora. It is one of the richest components of the ecosystem from the standpoint of biodiversity because of the large number of decomposers[1] and predators present, mostly belonging to invertebrates, fungi, algae, bacteria, and archaea.

@proudcanadian4020,"Most people know that comedians (Seth Meyers in particular) use satire to ridicule people's stupidity and/or vices (making Trump such an easy target) and that politicians and other public figures are most often the focus of said ridicule. And most people also know the difference between a late night talk show versus a legitimate news program. I am still unclear as to whether or not you are 'most people', seeing as you reacted so critically towards this segment. Regardless, if you feel a need to speak out against 'fake news' then good for you; you have that right, so go ahead. But you really should aim your vitriolic comments at legitimate reporters and/or news agencies. Attacking Seth for failing to do any research before 'making' news suggests that you lack not only a sense of humour, but also the capacity to understand that his show is, in fact, a satirical program and not the actual news. I would think seeing Trump pictured with a long beard, a squirrel on his shoulder, holding a walking stick and covered in leaves, would be a clear indication to anyone watching that this isn't a legitimate news report , so I am not sure what your concern over the spread of fake news stems from....You don't find Seth funny? Fine. But, why watch his show then? And you calling him out on the forest 'floor' thing? Also fine. Trump specifically mentioned the 'floors', but nevertheless, you are  justified in pointing out that forest 'floor' is the correct term.

This hate that keeps going back and forth its causes us to lose focus on what's really going on. Idk what the plan is here it could be so many different things but if we keep fighting amongst ourselves it will eventually lead to our demise. That's real talk. Wake up you stupid ppl. Do your own research and ask real questions. Follow your common sense if that's even a thing anymore. Some food for thought when Trump and Clinton were running for president did anyone stop and think why are these the two ppl that it came down to. Both are shady, manipulative, corrupt, and all the above. And as the ppl instead of fighting the whole system and asking wtf. We instead picked a side and now we are fighting each other. Wake up what's going on around us is very bad and only if we come together as ""humans"" not just ppl, not just races, humans, and we all get on the same page and decide that this government these organizations aren't helping us but in reality killing us, making us slaves to money.

Its a rip on Clinton, the SEALS or their commander is mentioned NOT AT ALL, but Trump knows his history, and you don't.

@mattlehnardt8035," @sudont  If Trump said that, I'd be pissed, being a supporter of our troops and their sacrifice, not their fault they work for the military industrial complex and don't know it. So I looked it up. See below.",6년 전,1,
@sudont,"A few things,  @mattlehnardt8035 . First, this is the full quote, which I heard on the radio long ago:   “Well it was an amazing phone call I made,” he said. “40 Wall Street actually was the second tallest building in downtown Manhattan and actually, before the World Trade Center, was the tallest and then when they built the World Trade Center, became known as the second tallest and now it’s the tallest and I just spoke to my people and they said it’s the most unbelievable sight. It’s probably seven or eight blocks away from the World Trade Center and yet Wall Street is littered with two feet of stone and brick and mortar and steel.”  In other words, the first thing he thinks of when the building is mentioned by the interviewer is, he now has the tallest building again. Who else would even think of such a thing on the day of the attack, let alone say it out loud? It has nothing to do with the context of the interview, other than they’re talking about the destruction of buildings which just occurred. No one prompted him to say it. For Trump, everything is thought of in relation to himself - “how does this affect me”. If you read the last paragraph of the article you link to, it makes it clear that the Examiner is wrong.  I don’t know what the second quote has to do with what we’re talking about, but one thing for certain is that Trump knows less than nothing about history. The 9/11 Commission Report, released in the aftermath of the attacks, documented the proposed December 1998 strike on Kandahar, (to kill Bin Laden), noting that the Joint Chiefs of Staff advised Clinton against launching cruise missiles at bin Laden and his associates. Officials were concerned about residual damage, including the roughly 200 to 300 civilians who could have been killed by such a strike. Is that what you mean by “wussing out”?  As for your comments about “fake news”...sigh...I don’t know what other conspiracy theories you believe in, but one thing to consider is how many people have to be in on it to make it work. In this case, it’s pretty much the whole world, excepting the Right-wing bubble of Fox, Breitbart, Russia Today, Rush Limbaugh, Alex Jones, and a few other clowns with web sites. What are the odds that every news service in the World except those is the fake liberal media, spewing concerted lies, and only the least educated 35% of Americans are smart enough to figure out who has the Truth? Something to think about.  Also, btw, the Sears Tower has been called the Willis Tower since 2009. It still stands - in Chicago.",6년 전,1,
@mattlehnardt8035," @sudont  Your response was topical and you didn't read or understand what I said. I can obviously see you want to split hairs on moot points. I toured the ""Sears Towers"" back in the 80s, when they were the Sears Towers. Splitting hairs. second, your quote that you amazingly remember word for word still doesn't prove Trumps statement meant he's boasting about his tower being taller. It was, up until they built SEARS towers in the 70's. Trump didn't build it, he bought it. If he was the pompous dick you say he is, why didn't he hurry and build a taller one years ago with his first billion?  Third, did you not read the Washington Examiner article from April 2018, pretty recent. Hint: the interviewer points out to Trump since SEARS towers are now gone, his building is the next tallest, and by default, the next obvious target for making a statement. I remember the news back in 1998 when Clinton 'wussed out' from bagging Bin Ladin when they didn't send a missile strike but had troops on the ground with Bin Ladin in their gunsights waiting for the order to pull the trigger, and Clinton let it slide, after sending them clear over there in harms way to do just that. Know anyone in the military who could school you on this bit of history? As far as me believing in conspiracy theories, heres one: Trump colluded with Russia to change votes and steal the election. WHAHAAAAAHAA HAA HA. You think the minute they had any ACTUAL evidence they'd have nailed Trump to the wall with it? Instead they've only spread rumors, myths, and allegations they'd LIKE to be true, but without any actual factual evidence. Now they've just let it go, cause after two years and 14 attorneys and millions spent, Mueller still has not produced any tangible evidence. But here's one: Obama ACTUALLY leaned over to Medvedev, Putins right hand man, and said, ""This is my last election, after this election I can be more flexible"". to do what? Umm, am i stupid, or does this sound like some sort of collusion? But the liberal media being Obama's bum kissing lapdogs never asked him about it. Hillary smashing devices and paying BleachBit to 'wipe' her servers, the very ones the FBI was demanding in a subpoena? Yeah, i believe in conspiracies, but the media would have me believing ones that don't actually exist while covering up the ones right in front of our faces.

We've settled for a Fahrenheit 451 future where the powerful just burn the books, or delete websites they don't agree with. Putin does the same thing erasing reporters who expose him.

Insurance companies also adjust sometimes according to the amount of raking that has been doine.

@Treebrother,"Forest floor or not. Why now is it so dangerous? Because it is incredibly dry and flammable. Why is it so incredibly dry and flammable? Lack of precipitation..Yes those firefighters that were raking were creating a fire break (A firebreak is a gap in vegetation or other combustible material that acts as a barrier to slow or stop the progress of a bushfire or wildfire. A firebreak may occur naturally where there is a lack of vegetation or ""fuel"", such as a river, lake or canyon)... We would do the same here in New England when fighting brush fires..We haven't had many of those lately. Because we have had an above average amount of precipitation. Whether the dry conditions in California are man made or not there is going to be a higher risk of fire. Thinking that anyone is going to completely clear millions of acres of forest of anything flammable is idiotic..Best case is to be mindful of open fires. Fires from lighting are a natural occurrence and it's own natural forest management. There will always be house on beachfront that get wiped out in hurricanes, House on hills that comedown in mudslides, and burnt in forest fires. These are the risks when building in such places. It's natural..Many become distraught over the loss of the unnatural man made concept of money and material property.  Yes the loss of life is tragic and I honestly am saddened for those affected.

@veeelle2275," Kenith Bolston   Trump got my vote, kind of, by default. Initially, anyway. At the time, I felt there wasn't much of an option. It was between a woman who'd say one thing to one group and something entirely different to another, depending on who her target audience was, at that moment. And her opponent, some pompous jerk, whose show I'd never watched, and who would just say exactly whatever he was thinking, no filter, no couth. Just whatever came to mind, spoken the way only filthy rich folk could get away with speaking. (Well, I've come to, rather, like that about him.) See, with Clinton, I'd never REALLY know how she felt about anything. I'd have to spend all my time dissecting her statements, as they aligned with her actions, in order to figure out what part of what she said, was honest or somewhat truthful, or just a plain ol' bold-face con job. Being a career politician, she has lying, down to an art. (I did some research on her and, boy !...) From her very first gig, her conduct was soooo unethical, and what's so damn surprising is that, she'd done illegal maneuvers, within the confines of a working case, and lied, hid evidentiary files, that were exculpatory, in nature, (beneficial to the other side. And she hid them, that's a no-no). It was discovered, she was kicked off the team and it's well- documented, BUT, amazingly, she wasn't immediately disbarred, as one would've, undoubtedly assumed. In fact, apart from some finger wagging and harshly worded admonishment from the presiding judge, nothing else came of it and she was allowed to continue in her career, mastering in all methods of deceit and cover-up, anything to win, growing into the Untouchable Hillary, of today. It's actually, very interesting, you should check her out, a real piece of work. Anyway, I decided that, had it been a personality contest, I would've had to forfeit. Thankfully, it wasn't and apprehensively, Trump got my vote cuz I figured, I didn't have to want to HANG OUT with the person who took office, as much as, believe he could organize the right people to do the required duties that would benefit our country, and its citizens. And, because he's got an ego, he'd wanna do things that would get him props, worldwide. (Well, he may need a little more time with this, he's not quite done pissing everybody off, yet. Give him time..) I never have to wonder for long, how President Trump feels about any one subject, if you give him a sec, he'll tell ya EXACTLY what he thinks. Beats trying to guess. I don't always agree with or like his views, but he loves America, I know that. I think it must be hard for him to get things done with so much opposition at every juncture. But he's still gettin' things done. Regardless of what one may think of him, he IS the president, I WANT him to be successful in making America great. I wish people would go back to a time when we were more respectful of our elders, of our officials, of each other ...regardless of our personal and political views.

I mean, I'm no saint.) I, very much think that, Trump becoming president, has changed his focus from himself, to the country. As a business owner, your alliance is to making your company survive and thrive, etc... You claim those credits your tax lawyer tells you about to keep from paying out more than need be, even if they're not exactly on the up and up, meh.  But, when you're overseeing an entire COUNTRY, you do what's best for the people. Is he still a businessman? You betcha, and that comes in handy, in his negotiations with other world leaders. But, as president, his focus has shifted from himself, to the survival of America.  His run at office, he says was conceived out of concern for our nation, and, what he saw as a lack of competency in those, at the helm. I had no idea how right he was. (Hillary, with/under Obama's administration sold Russia 20% of our uranium. ?? And, then they act like Russia's still an enemy of America? Wt... It's weird, my entire way of thinking has been changed, with this guy's  presidency. I thought I knew things pertaining our government, it's only been through Trump, that I've recently realized the deception, the lies, everything, as being completely backwards. I always identified as a Democrat, I thought they stood for the same things I embraced. They don't. They lie. I'm not a Conservative, by no means, so now that I've been left with no rightful party, I've decided I'm not going by party lines but, by individual candidacy  policies.

Well, I like black people too but there's a point where you can go overboard and that was one of those cases with Obama.You still think of Trump as the guy running the TV show Apprentice. And we could all tell that everyone on SNL got miffed with Trump when he came on and I'm sure it's because he tried to take over the show. One of his bad traits. He does get pushy I'm sure. But forgive and forget for crying out loud. He's accomplished quite a bit more than that before the show came out. I thought apprentice was kind of dumb but it turned out to be another one of Donald's success stories. You say he failed in Atlantic city, well, so did a lot of those other Hotel owners who had to shut down. And as far as being president, don't you think he should get credit for beating out all those other stiffs on both sides? As far as I'm concerned...a accomplished outstanding businessman is a way better pick as a president than some dumb attorney that most of the time is in it only for the money. Why do you think we have so much corruption in the government? Lawyers are known to be greedy and they never have to produce anything in their line of work. Just TALK! Like you do. So back off, grow up and show some respect for the head of our country. I'm sure you didn't vote for him, but we had to put up with Obama for 8 years. Try giving Trump a chance.

@HiReeZin,"Finland should be flattered that we are used as the best example of good forest management. And a compliment it was. Not sure the machinery used in Finland classifies precisely as ""raking machines"" according to use of the word in English, but that's  irrelevant. Not much fire prone dry shrublands here either, and no forest fire here could proceed as rapidly as to create California-like catastrophes. Out of the two good reasons to take care of California forests we have only one: economic gains in forestry.  All in all the left is full of idiots. They don't know how to use dictionary, don't understand anything about forestry, don't understand the fires can be slowed down by pre-emptive measures, and are willing sacrifice tens of lives, tens of thousands of homes and billions of dollars for their twisted ideology. They call themselves greens but never even visit the forest themselves. And worst of all, when someone tries to speak for those life saving measures (Trump was only one of the many to bring the issue up - I think it has been argued for years in USA) , they laugh and make it a show.  I'm really angry to these people!   If Germany leaves coal and nuclear and replaces it with another 55 billion cubic meters of Russian gas (Nord Stream 2), it will represent up to 20% of Germany's primary energy. Dependency on Russian energy and potential negative sides of that is a common talking subject in European politics, but I guess CNN doesn't like political topics  Probably other Trump statements are to the point as well.

I'm a Centre-left leaning moderate from Australia and watching your Veep speak recently at the APEC summit in Papua New Guinea was a like a breath of fresh air. I haven't followed him enough to have formed a definite opinion as yet but I imagine I would strongly oppose pretty much all of Vice President Pence's political and social policies; however, at least he can string a sentence together. Red state voters may have their reasons for disliking the coastal elites and those who represent them such as Obama or Hillary, but Trump is not your guy. He's a figurehead and not even very good at being that! America, the rest of the world understands the importance of patriotism in your country (we've seen all the movies), but the rest of the world matters too, and the rest of the world is laughing at you with this dickhead in the Oval Office. As an Aussie, I probably shouldn't talk considering our equally laughable merry-go-round of Prime Ministers we've had over the last 10 years, but again, at least all of them had some intelligence and humility. I'm just waiting for Trump to say ""America has the best Chinese food, better than Chyyyna! I ordered some last night from Ober... after we visited Pleasant"".",6년 전,6,

Every year during the dry season, especially here in the ""cerrado"" (midwest Brazil) they use to clean a lane on the ground in certain strategic areas, removing the vegetation, which is useful for isolating the green forest from the dry vegetation, in case a fire occurs in the forest. And they even do that along a track of about 2 or 3 meters away from the roadsides, so if there's a burning going on the drivers won't be affected.

@TheLizardskin," @edgarvalderrama1143  at first, thanks for your comment. You're right, Brazil also needs to do its homework. I'm not proud of this situation happening here in my backyard, not only in Amazonia, but also in the Cerrado, including all  devastation already done in the Pampas Gaúchos (Brazil has a lot more biodiversity than the rain forest). Unfortunately, most of our governments (included the dictatorial and ""democratic"" period) haven't given proper attention to issues like that. The only thing I can do here is vote for candidates and parties which at least try to demonstrate some concern about enviromental issues. I can't do anything when my brazilian countrymen decided to elect and ultra right-wing politician who doesn't seem to give a damn about these questions. But I'm not blind. I know that we have a lot of homework to do. But at least Brazil is (still) signing in the Paris Agreement, and enviromental issues has been put in debate, and defended by some parties and politicians. My question to you is: why shouldn't I comment about Donald Trump? is this prohibited?",6년 전,2,

The so-called ""Federal Republic"" of Germany is a pseudo state and illegal. The ""Federal Republic"" (so-called ""Bundesrepublik"") has nothing in the slightest in commen with the genuine Germany. The ""Federal Republic"" is an imposter ""state"", simply a fake ""superviser"" remotely controlling the genuine German people. I'm now ashamed that, following the close of WWII, we allies set up this fake and illegal ""state"" ""Federal Republic"" of Germany and coercively clamped it upon the genuine, highly cultured and friendly GERMAN population. This was illegal then and - in view of the domestic political development here in the intervening decades - this act has taken on a criminal character. I hope this message penetrates sufficiently to cause many Non-Germans residing outside the ""Bundesrepublik"" to undertake their own personal research into the real phenomenon ""Bundesrepublik"".

When he said last night he meant it as recently(You don't have to take everything so literally!).   In Germany they are using very unconventional methods of creating electricity. Such as the burning of trash including plastic and they are in fact running out of trash to burn and have already started running out of trash and have resorted to importing fuel for their electrical plants.  France just like Sweden is in the middle of an immigrant crisis. places such as Paris (mainly in fact) have seen drastic rises in criminality as well as gang activity. this likely to the extreme rise of immigration into Paris. There are many reports of the french natives moving away from the city due to all the crime and immigrants at the same time as many new immigrants are flowing in. this has deeply impacted Paris as a tourist destination due to many no longer wanting to go there since they no longer have that distinctive culture nor the city having that cinematic feel(I believe this is what he is referring to his friend talking about).   And lastly, The Finland thing  Is very true I am half Finnish my self and have seen and experienced these things first hand. The Finnish are known for being a forest nation. in fact the wood industry is their biggest industry. this has caused them to have a lot of respect for their forests and take very good care of them. They clean them and maintain them and if the summers are really dry they water them it is this active caring and watching of their forests which Mr Donald J. Trump is referring to.

Which scientist does not know how long it takes to brake down? I learned about this in high school and in more depth my first year of college. Who believes trees grow faster than we cut them down, do you? Which scintist does not know there are approximately 1.3 -1.5 billion cows in the world flatulating everyday. Core samples is just one piece of evidence to understand Earths history. There were no ice caps when the dinosaurs dominated the Earth and it was only a few degrees of average temperature higher than now. You have to understand what average temperature means. Trump says really stupid things like ""I had to put a jacket on so global warming is a hoax."" This demonstrates that he does not understand what average temperature means.   There is also global cooling.  The great lakes were formed by melted ice. There are scratch marks through all the granite rocks where the glaciers used to be surrounding the great lakes.  There are jellyfish fossils from water that has long since vanished, dried up, as the Earth is still in its warming cycle now.

If you're not aware of the changes in those cities, you're really not paying attention. The Germans are probably laughing out of guilty embarrassment over what they've allowed to happen to their country with the migrant issue.   Merkel HAS been dealing with Russia regarding oil, by the way.  How do you not know that? It's pretty ballsy when we've been paying into NATO primarily to PROTECT them from Russia. Duplicitous.   Also, forest management really is a thing, if you weren't aware. I don't know about Finland, but the Germans, to their credit, have been effectively managing their forests for many years. I doubt they would ever allow the build-up of dead trees and brush that we do. California's chaparral is naturally supposed to burn periodically, but we ""protect"" it until it builds up into a virtual tinderbox.

But I will gladly give back the small amount (compared to the rich that Trump truly protects and rewards) of $$ I got back for lowered taxes in order to protect the environment and help those less fortunate. Do you deny the lies he has stated about other countries? He lies constantly and he has pulled us from important peace embracing treaties. He hasn't created a better relationship with China or Russia --- and North Korea is doing what they want behind closed doors - they laugh at Trump as do all countries - because he's clueless and he doesn't even try to educate himself about foreign affairs. Look at the battle he has brewing with his own first choice for Sec of State - Tillerson! Do you deny or doubt Tillerson? He's a proud republican and he knows how stupid and dangerous Trump is...he said so! Trump is ignoring Saudi Arabia and their hand in torturing and killing a journalist...Why? Because they bailed out his business and he has personal conflicts of interest! How is that in the best interest of America or any civil country or person? You've hit the nail on the head --- all you Trump supporters care about is lining your pockets --- you don't care at what expense. Our future generations will see the downfall of America with the election of Trump...and those of you who elected him are complicit. I just hope his damage can be reversed. Trump's economic uplift is temporary --- GM has already had to shut down plants due to the tariffs - the gov't had to bail out farmers due to the tariffs --- you haven't seen the negative side of his economic decisions --- but they are coming. His attacks on the military and his own staff - his attacks on Americans from his interviews and his tweets are the most un-presidential behavior demonstrated by a sitting president. He is an arrogant, misogynist, narcissistic, psychopath - I just don't know how so many can support him. My only guess is you're like paid off flunkies that care more about the extra $100-200 a month you get in your check than you care about your soul, other people, or the environment.

But if his phone is password protected and you cannot access it you have to hire a hacker because that is what I did and I got  everything diverted from his cellphone directly to mine without touching it.I noticed how much secrecy he maintained with his  phone so I decided that the photo gallery and emails and virtually everything needed to be checked.But in my opinion it is better to hire a hacker who has successfully done this for someone before so I will  recommend the person that helped me during my time..

@diomepa2100," @firepuppies4086  The Finnish president pretty much said in Finnish news he has not discussed raking and he was thinking really hard where Trump got that idea.  Also not sure if Trump said that our president has told him we raked. He told him we are forest nation - which he did.  Then Trump goes with his 3-yeard-old-worthy explanation about what we are doing.   However I have no freaking clue how CNN went from raking to raking leaves. So no we don't rake leaves or needles in the forest, but that's not what Trump said.   But yes, we (Finland) very much ""rake"" the deadwood off especially in risky areas. We very much clean snags (as in dead standing trees) . We remove 10-15 million cubic meters of ""natural loss"" a year. Let that number sink in. And this is after that was dialed down to protect biodiversity. Bugs and birds you know.  We have less fires than 100 years ago. It's absolutely insulting to claim it's the weather, it has not gotten colder in here.  So laugh at Trump how much you want, but he has point that we are ""doing stuff"" and we have less fire problems than our neighbors. And California forest fires for us are are like wars in middle east - always was always will be, and it's always someone else's fault.",6년 전(수정됨),0,
@firepuppies4086," @diomepa2100  while I see what you mean, the ""doing stuff"" comment is extremely general. The thing is Trump denies it's based on climate change when the affected area has been having drought issues.

@diomepa2100," @firepuppies4086  the drought has the effect of millions of trees dying, and drought stressed trees being really susceptible to bark beetles - which also kill them. Trump admitting climate change will not resurrect those trees, they must be removed. He might not understand how it's done but he gets that something can be done, and should be done. It's pretty ironic that people crying ""climate change"" have trouble accepting you need to adapt to it and do damage control. Let the forest burn then, that would surely help climate change.  We (Finland) are planting (well the locals do the labor) and managing forests in Tanzania, Kenya, Angola, Colombia, Brazil - and what does California do? Teaching the world about importance of forests while their own is dying. I mean sure, we appreciate the celebrity power in persuading them, but time to look in the own backyard for a moment. In some cases quite literally.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@docholliday9058,"Haven't you ever heard about the great raking of Vammalla 1967? Well, allow me to teach you a valuable lesson in history:  The year prior Finland had come up a bit short on the war reparations paid at the time for the Soviet Union, so in the early spring Chairman Malenkov had made a ruthless demand for the Finns to supply them with massive amounts of gardening tools to make up for the difference. The demand was under a great threat of economic sanctions, which would have halted the vodka importation for an unknown period of time, which was obviously unacceptable for the Finns. Hesitantly the whole nation complied, still recovering from the war at the time, unable to afford any shortage of the precious liquor favored by so many. After all, this was two years before the legislation regarding the sale of standard beer in grocery stores (462/1968) had passed, and proper drinks for Saturday sauna were not as easy to come by as they are today. However, come autumn, come the leaves, and the forests would be filled with the decaying fire hazards the great nation of Finland had tended and cleared out so carefully throughout the centuries with the ancient art of forest raking. The situation was looking very dire, and as the summer was closing to the end, the leaders of the country were desperately searching for a viable solution. But behold, for the great innovation of the nation strikes again. Unknown to the government at the time, the engineers of Fiskars corporation had also foreseen the upcoming travesty and worked hard throughout the summer and had finally come up with a plan just in time to save the nation from nature's garbage. The corporation had started mass-production of scissors almost as soon as the Soviet demand had been fulfilled. It took way less time and resources to produce these scissors than new rakes would have cost, and it was possible to spread them across the country way more conveniently in smaller packages, and to top it all, technically they needed not be categorized as gardening tools, preventing Soviet claim over them. The young nation had been blessed with new hope for a salvation indeed. The scissors were also equipped with orange handles in order to make them easier to locate if lost in the forest, and it was this design that remains iconic to this very day! That is indeed what Fiskars is still the best known for; The orange-handled scissors of 1967! When the autumn closed in and the leaves started to turn the reddish and orange hue, the nation got to work. For the following weeks the Finns cut the leaves down using the scissors and collected them into garbage bags before they could fall down and pollute to great forest floors. And this is how the nation was saved once again!  To this very day the Finns rake the floors of the forests in order to keep their nation safe and sound from the great threats of the nature. The end.",6년 전,0,

@patricialafountain1432,".THIS IS A VERY LONG READ ABOUT MUELLER AND WHAT HE HAS DONE SO FAR, if your up to it.  .WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge ordered former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to report to prison as scheduled, rejecting his last-minute bid to delay his two-week sentence. Papadopoulos is to begin serving his sentence Monday.  He was sentenced in September for lying to the FBI in the Russia investigation. He had sought a postponement of his prison term until an appeals court had ruled in a separate case challenging the constitutionality of special counsel Robert Mueller's appointment.  The special counsel’s investigation has, so far, produced nearly 200 criminal charges against 32 people and three businesses.  Five people have pleaded guilty to crimes; including three former Trump associates (former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, former national security advisor Michael Flynn, and former campaign adviser Rick Gates).  On August 21, 2018, a jury in Alexandria, Virginia found a fourth former Trump associate, former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, guilty.  And 25 Russian citizens and three Russian businesses face charges for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Mueller’s probe started in May 2017 and soon expanded to look into whether Trump obstructed justice.  He filed charges of financial crimes on October 30, 2017 against Manafort and Gates – who ran the Trump campaign for five months in 2016.  That same day, Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials.  And on December 1, 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI about his conversation with Russia’s U.S. ambassador.  He’s been cooperating with the special counsel since. The New Year brought with it a new list of developments.  On February 16, 2018, 13 Russians and three Russian companies were charged with meddling in the 2016 U.S. election through social media.  That same day, a California man, Richard Pinedo, pleaded guilty to identity fraud for selling false bank accounts, including to some Russians.  Just days later, on February 20, 2018, Dutch lawyer Alex van der Zwaan, who has ties to Russia, pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about his work and his communications with Gates.  On February 22, 2018, Mueller added 32 new charges against Manafort and Gates. But then Gates flipped on the next day, pleading guilty to lying to investigators and conspiracy.  Less than two months later, on April 3, 2018, van der Zwaan was sentenced to 30 days in prison and received a fine of $20,000. He becomes the first person to be sentenced in the Mueller probe.  Then on June 8, 2018, Mueller hit Manafort again with charges of witness tampering. That led a judge to revoke Manafort’s bail, end his house arrest, and send him to jail to wait for his August trial to start.  The special counsel also charged one of Manafort’s former aides, Konstantin Kilimnik. He worked for Manafort in Ukraine and potentially has ties to Russian intelligence.  One month later, on July 13, 2018, Mueller charged 12 more Russians with hacking the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election. Things intensify  As a Virginia jury deliberated Manafort’s fate in August, The New York Times reported White House lawyer Don McGahn has been cooperating extensively with Mueller.  On August 21, 2018, the 12-person jury found Manafort guilty of eight of the 18 financial crimes he was charged with. Gates was the government’s star witness.  Manafort faces another trial in Washington, D.C. in mid-September.  That same day, Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to eight counts of his own financial crimes. He also implicated Trump in his courtroom statement.  Mueller had previously handed over the investigation into Cohen to prosecutors in New York.  A lawyer for Cohen has said his client has information that will be ‘of interest’ to the special counsel. Like Comment Share Comments Patricia LaFountain Write a comment...",6년 전,0,

When talking about forest care, raking refers to removing the chopping waste and other flammable materials from the ground in general, not raking your leaves and whatnot, and yes, we do do that in Finland. Practically none of the big media houses (which incidently have been against Trump ever since he announced he would run for presidency) cared about the actual expert comments saying Trumps choice of words was correct, translations were not. Of course no-one cares about the actual truth in the matter, as long as we get the memes and laughs, no matter if they're in any way related to reality.",6년 전,22,
@louel53,"This is not a translation issue. No translation was necessary to understand his remarks in Canada.    Pres. Trump thinks raking is done with a garden rake, as he also refers to the firefighters who were using garden rakes. He has no idea about forest management, the forest industry, the differences between Finland and California forests and climate.     Pres. Trump thinks people have to show ID to buy groceries.   Do not assume other people don't understand what he is saying.  You don't have to be against Trump to laugh at him; you simply have to be sane and rational.",6년 전,9,

They had brought in the land sharks to maintain their forests and keep them neat and tidy, but there got to be too many of them, so St. Patrick got rid of all the sharks, such a great man, really...doesn't get enough credit. Since then the Finlands over the years have trained their trees to uproot themselves and run away from fires when they happen...we need to educate our trees to do the same thing.

Okay honey because you seem veeery off and very brain washed in many places!   So first of all.. a fact is Islam does not equal cancer period. You are the cancer! I'm a muslim okay.. we are not oppressed by our men! We are not violated! We are loved and cared about!  We pray to cleanse our souls from evil thoughts.. to remember that God is watching and he won't let us down. That any hard moment we live is going to end and after a year or two we wont even remember the details! I am proud to be muslim. Oh and don't come at me with the ""your prophet is a pedophile"" and all that bullshit cuz what happend 1400 years ago is already fabricated and even the news you read now are fake so now you want to tell me that a man that through islam gave women the right to inherit her parents and not be killed as a child just because she's a  woman is a pedophile ! Look at the societies today.. women harassed.. even the President i harassing! Look at yourself claiming to be the one right and not respecting my religion. The inequality and the disgusting truth about rape and bullying in schools. Is all this okay??? Is that what your parents told you to do? What you leaned in school or even church that teaches everything but the bible??

If there's a bully in class the people supporting the bully aren't bullying right? I have seen Europe before the refugee i dont need to see footage. It's different but not in a bad way. And you need to educate your self about people because not all arabs are muslims and not all muslims are uneducated. I can say that yes some countries like in parts of syria and lebanon there's lots if uneducation among people in villages and they are not muslim or the things they do dont gave anything to do with islam. Like marrying your cousin is really common.. no religion says you cant marry your cousin or culture or law in any country that I know of. But this is wrong when children in some cases dont choose the partner and end up marrying the person when they are 18. And other things like under age marrige yes you find this here but even in western countries but it's not shown in the media a lot of times and sometimes its not marrige cuz the western world isnt really religios anymore so its a girl having a relationship with a man. So thats a thing right there and I dont even need to mention what falls into this cuz unless you've been living under a rock you wouldn't know about all this. When you think about it it's the western world that us always having probldms with women and it's here where all of the rape happens. Lets not even talk about mass shootings. And I dont care if you that about Eu or US. All of you are racist and only some of you show it. It stings. In my home country a woman is appricuated and reaaaaallly loved. They dont even let women wait in ques your order is faster because they dont want you to feel weak or unprotected. It beautiful. How everyone knows their role in the relationship and what you need to do. I buy the things and you fix it. If you dont mind you can stay at home but hell yaas if you want to work.    Let me tell you something about the western wirld.. until about 1923 women weren't allowed to attend university in the US.

Not all problems are caused by immigrants and most unpopular problems arebecase of swedish people with european background to be correct. A country with no fear is actually nit healthy because it means there's no life, no crime, no job for the police.. even a doctor, me as a surgeon if my mortality rate is low doesn't mean I'm a good surgeon it only means that I dont have the experience. And today sweden has 10 million people.. in the ladt two or three years there was a groth of about 1/2 million people.. a bigger population only means more problems. Just in school a class with 10 students isn't like one with 70 or 80 students. It gers loud and hard to control. And this actually doesn't have anything with immigrants because if you look at the swedish police in most cities you'll find that the majority dont have swedish background which only indicates that immigrants are trying to work and pish their kids to work. I know people that are doctors but Arbetsförmedlingen wouldnt give them oppertunities to work as doctors. Look at the universities the majority of people are from other backgrounds. Okay now look at Umeå in the north.. a city almost only for students. The majority are from the middle east or even asia and africa just.. Sweden is beautiful and the only problwm right now is that people need to adjust their minds. As long as I now count as a citizent Im a part of this society and I want to build and develop it. Doesn't matter if I came from Iraq or Syria. This is now my homeland. I may be second or third generation but in about 20 years arab people will be offical as a minority group in sweden.

His use of the term ""raking"" was correct to describe a technique of clearing the ground cover in forests.  Most uneducated Americans and Finns think about a rake such as that used to clear leaves from your yard, but in forest management and logging, raking is a tool used with a bulldozer to clear debris from the floor into large piles to be removed later.

There are grapple rakes, brush rakes root rakes ratchet rakes and so on. You can see these working in Finland under power-lines pretty much every year, and pretty often in forest plantations. Though mostly these days we use mulchers.  California is so far beyond brush raking, they got 60+ millions of dead bug infested trees they haven't taken care of.  Those trees will be fire hazard unless removed.  So either you do that, or watch the forests burn and contribute to global warming.  How you do that? - you pay for it.

Not to mention the fact that scientists had begun predicting the current warming trend as a product of man made climate change a decade before that bullshit article on ""global cooling"" was even written.   Then there's your claim that the predictions haven't proven out.

Dude.  Politics are dividing lots of people and realistically, political correctness is silencing the majority.  The spark that lit the fire which is burning in France right now came from the massive taxation of fuel.  But it is dishonest to say ""the price of fuel.""  The price of the thing is not the same thing as an item after tax.  After all, in some cases, purchases are tax exempt.  Does tax exemption change the price or simply omits the added cost?  I'm sure you know basic math so I can conclude you are simply being dishonest.  And to say this hasn't also been about other issues including migration of people who are there to live off of the welfare of Europe is also dishonest.  The fact is, most people opposing much of the EU policies do not feel free to speak out against it.  And the reason they are using this opportunity is clear and obvious, the combined numbers are massive.  Trump may be considered by you to be an absolute clown, but he's one man who is dramatically and drastically changing the world for the better.  But to claim ""all of France thinks he's a clown"" is a ridiculous claim.  You don't speak for all of France any more than I speak for all of the USA.

@anjinmiura6708," @colinsowka1459  And now the yellow vests are protesting the EU.  Are you still going to claim this is merely about fuel taxes?  You might be able to make that claim but only if you admit that France, the former country, has given up its sovereignty to be a state owned and controlled by the EU and its unelected leadership.  The people of Europe who thought this was a great idea should now start to realize what a giant pile or trouble you're in.  No control over who comes into your country, (no-go zones where even police and emergency people are unwelcome and unwilling to enter?) and on and on?

For Europe, it has already gone too far.  You're about to be reminded about what the crusades were REALLY about -- Islam invading Europe and all of the things Islam instructs the faithful to do.

@kneelbefore6978,"All of Trump's claims are true!  I'm Swedish myself and can confirm that Sweden indeed has an immigrant problem which I believe is what trump was referring to. When he said last night he meant it as recently(You don't have to take everything so literally!).   In Germany they are using very unconventional methods of creating electricity. Such as the burning of trash including plastic and they are in fact running out of trash to burn and have already started running out of trash and have resorted to importing fuel for their electrical plants.  France just like Sweden is in the middle of an immigrant crisis. places such as Paris (mainly in fact) have seen drastic rises in criminality as well as gang activity. this likely to the extreme rise of immigration into Paris. There are many reports of the french natives moving away from the city due to all the crime and immigrants at the same time as many new immigrants are flowing in. this has deeply impacted Paris as a tourist destination due to many no longer wanting to go there since they no longer have that distinctive culture nor the city having that cinematic feel(I believe this is what he is referring to his friend talking about).   And lastly, The Finland thing  Is very true I am half Finnish my self and have seen and experienced these things first hand. The Finnish are known for being a forest nation. in fact the wood industry is their biggest industry. this has caused them to have a lot of respect for their forests and take very good care of them. They clean them and maintain them and if the summers are really dry they water them it is this active caring and watching of their forests which Mr Donald J. Trump is referring to.   If you don't believe me you can do your own research with a few google searches it's really not that hard. I'm writing all of this due to the  obviously very uninformed masses of people in the comments making all of these assumptions as well as slandering the President and his sayings. to all of you (you know who i'm talking about), I just really want to say what to me is so obvious.

@rafaelcaetano7650,"I laugh and agree with mostly everything on this video. However, Trump is right about Germany being dependent on Russia! More and more, Germany and the eastern europeans countries are increasing their dependency on Russian Gas, instead of finding strong energetic alternatives. And you know why? Because it is just cheaper to use the already existing gas pipelines that connect Germany to Russia through the eastern european coutries (Poland, Ukraine, etc).. Regarding fossil fuels, the other alternative that could stop Germany from suffering a long and cold winter would be importing LNG from far away countries (it can be 30 - 40% more expensive though)... Instead, Gerhard Schröder (previous German chancellor) is leading the deals with Gazprom and other russian companies to build a pipeline (NordStream 2) that connects Germany directly to Russia through the Baltic sea, bypassing all the other eastern countries, and thus, contribute to a greater dependency of Germany to Russian oil and gas. And why should germans and europeans should care about this? Because Putin can just close the pipelines or increase the prices a lot... this is not new... he has done it in 2009 with Ukraine, where millions of people had no gas whatsoever for days, including other countries like the Czech Republic and Poland that were very dependent on the oil that was coming from Ukraine (which came from Russia). Do not get me wrong. I deeply hate Trump and all of what he represents. However, those german politians are laughing about what? They are the fools here. (clean energy is another obvious alternative, but fossil fuels are still going to take the biggest slice of the energetic pie for the next few decades. Clean energy alone is still not enough, although a lot of investment has to be made here by Germany and the rest of Europe).",6년 전,0,

@sarab2493,"zCREz What argument are you trying to make with the flat earth thing? My “grip on reality” is formed by statistics and science, it’s not set in stone or driven by misguided fear. I did acknowledge that Sweden has a issue of corruption but inflating it like you do is akin to fear mongering.  Having a toxic debate climate is not the same as corruption. When you state a opinion/belief (I’ve read you bringing up voting for SD as an example) you are always in risk with losing family members or friends that does not share the same ideology etc. The law protects the workers right to adhere to opposition organisations and their right to privacy. I can’t comment on the suicide part more than that it’s tragic.  Mob mentality is never a good thing and it occurs on both side, on every issue and is certainly not a new phenomena or unique for Sweden. I think your confusing mob mentality with corruption. I do agree that the debate here in Sweden is often quick to label things as sexist, racist, homophobic, nazi etc. but what you’re doing with comparing and equaling North Korea to Sweden isn’t much better.  I think it was you who asked in the thread “why import more issues?”.

The report in NYT is false because it makes it seem like all swedes were confused about what Trump was trying to say when in fact it was quite clear to alot of people that he was talking about the general state of sweden and the immigration. The picture that the government and the media want to portray is simply not true anymore.  Take this article for instance: https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/smaland/efter-hot-och-vald-nu-tranar-skoterskorna-sjalvforsvar In the emergency ward in Kalmar the nurses have started taking self defence classes to be able to protect themselves from patients and the relatives of patients.

The left is just trying to use that to sweep the whole thing under the carpet.  Also to clarify I am not defending Trump per say, I don't particularly like Trump. He was a better choice than Hillary im my opinion but that is beside the point.  I'm just upset that people are saying nothing is wrong in Sweden when it clearly is.

@kneelbefore6978,"All of Trump's claims are true!  I'm Swedish myself and can confirm that Sweden indeed has an immigrant problem which I believe is what trump was referring to. When he said last night he meant it as recently(You don't have to take everything so literally!).   In Germany they are using very unconventional methods of creating electricity. Such as the burning of trash including plastic and they are in fact running out of trash to burn and have already started running out of trash and have resorted to importing fuel for their electrical plants.  France just like Sweden is in the middle of an immigrant crisis. places such as Paris (mainly in fact) have seen drastic rises in criminality as well as gang activity. this likely to the extreme rise of immigration into Paris. There are many reports of the french natives moving away from the city due to all the crime and immigrants at the same time as many new immigrants are flowing in. this has deeply impacted Paris as a tourist destination due to many no longer wanting to go there since they no longer have that distinctive culture nor the city having that cinematic feel(I believe this is what he is referring to his friend talking about).   And lastly, The Finland thing  Is very true I am half Finnish my self and have seen and experienced these things first hand. The Finnish are known for being a forest nation. in fact the wood industry is their biggest industry. this has caused them to have a lot of respect for their forests and take very good care of them. They clean them and maintain them and if the summers are really dry they water them it is this active caring and watching of their forests which Mr Donald J. Trump is referring to.   If you don't believe me you can do your own research with a few google searches it's really not that hard. I'm writing all of this due to the  obviously very uninformed masses of people in the comments making all of these assumptions as well as slandering the President and his sayings. to all of you (you know who i'm talking about), I just really want to say what to me is so obvious.

@BBrinckmann1992,"@Teemu I live in Norway and am involved in somewhat larger forestry in the Netherlands. Here in Norway, they do not rake the forest floor, rather they try and make people aware of forest fire danger every summer. It is very difficult getting into the forest with large machines, which is why certain clean up projects only can be combined with regular forestry. What is used for forestry nowadays are so called Harvesters, that both cut the trees, removes the branches, and puts the logs on a trailer. However you have to create pathways for these machines. Usually they do this by taking the branches from the trees and the forest floor and place them in front of the machine. In this manner there is less compression of the earth underneath. The weight of these machines would otherwise compress the earth so much that it greatly reduces fertility (which is why our industrial agriculture has caused such a dramatic drop in soil fertility). Also, you can treat the forest floor with a kind of plow afterwards, in order to create a better growing bed for seedlings. So, in conclusion, the removal of (dead) material from the forest floor (not the 'floor of the forest'), is usually combined with the logging prospects. Otherwise it's too difficult to get into the forest, and let's not mention what the costs would be for this kind of clean up. The forests around California probably have different management that does not always coincide with industrial forestry. Plus that the resources to remove dead material through manual labor simply aren't there. There is a way to effectively remove dead plant material from the forest floor, which is through burning the vegetation in same manner as the Aboriginals in Australia do in certain parts of the country. This does pose some benefits, but also contains many disadvantages. Which is the reason why it has been prohibited in so many countries in Europe, since we used to have similar practices.",6년 전(수정됨),2,
@Bnelen,He's talking about forestry and taking care of the forest growth cycles so the trees can grow in a desired manner of pattern and ratio.  This is done to achieve optimum amount of quality wood. After the process these areas are more resistant to forest fires. So... Trump is correct and you people laughing are clueless.   Also he is not a textbook example of the Dunning-Kruger effect. That's you. Boom.,6년 전,1,
@BBrinckmann1992," @Bnelen  I haven't heard him implying this at any state of his speech. He strongly implied that the best way of preventing forest fire is by manually removing all plant litter as to stop fire from spreading. He saw the fire fighters do this in front of the spreading which is a logical course of action. However this does not mean that the entirety of the woodlands should be treated like this. It is practically impossible, and it rapidly reduces soil fertility causing a whole range of different problems. Trump sees and hears a few things and instantly thinks he knows better. This makes him a perfect example of the dunning-kruger effect. No, when it comes to forest fires, the real issue is unpredictable, extreme weather due to too rapid increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. I honestly was surprised that Trump acknowledged climate change in this whole debacle, albeit barely.",6년 전,0,
@Bnelen, @BBrinckmann1992  Those conclusions of him are conjecture.  I don't like dishonesty.,6년 전,0,
@BBrinckmann1992," @Bnelen  First I want to say that I admire that you stand up for him in a space here on Youtube that is anti-Trump. I think that is very brave, and people should be applauded for that. The problem with the internet today is that we no longer have respect for the people on the other side of the argument. So I just want to highlight that my criticism against Trump is not meant as criticism against you. The thing is, I have seen Trump do the same thing so many times. A few times would be okay, but he keeps doing it which is the reason why I have to make that Dunning-Kruger conclusion about him. At this point it no longer is conjecture. Trump presents so many arguments and things as facts, which are blatantly wrong if you fact check him. This whole situation with the forest fire, it isn't the first time. The kind of obvious misinformation that he spreads is something he does on weekly basis. Of course many other politicians have done so before him, but not in such an obvious, and frankly unprofessional manner. This makes him quite an easy man to read and to make conclusions about. And if you think about all the conjectures he makes about other people, especially refugees. The things he says aren't facts based on observation or careful study. You can clearly see and deduce that he improvises the facts he states based on a few things he's seen or heard. In fact, the word conjecture fits his opinions perfectly. Which is the reason why I want to be vocally critical about him. We have to fight back against the leaders that we feel threatened by. He is, in my mind, a con man. And he has conned himself into presidency, the possibility of such being a side effect of the modern era of the internet. Those that have been conned by him, should not be the ones on the receiving end of the dissatisfaction of the ones that oppose him. The USA has become too divided and people should try and reach each other again. The world has far bigger problems coming than Donald Trump, and we should all work together in order to deal with those problems. Those terrible forest fires in California for example, eventually such events will effect me in Europe as well, and vice versa. So please, if you want to continue this discussion I would love to, because I think it is very beneficial when people of differing opinions converse with each other. In fact, if you want to discuss the matter via video I would gladly make time for this.",6년 전,0,

I have proved it by getting them both to agree that it is 'just oh so good' and then had them discuss it and then it got idiotic. By stating 'tired old socialism BS' means you have no idea what socialism is. That is why you claim it is BS which it isn't because well look at Venezuela I mean it is still going strong and failing today. To know what is going on in the world isn't being a stupid mother fucker. It is called intelligence and which my comment 'willfully ignorant' shows true. You should study and learn about what is going on in the world before you tell someone that they are a stupid mother fucker. They are very much the same which tells me you was an obama supporter and you still very much love what he did. He did as much as damage as trump is doing except obama concealed his intentions which trump doesn't and that's why obama supporters are ashamed of him. If trump concealed himself as well, obama supporters would love him.

@docholliday9058,"Didn't your grandfather ever tell you about the great raking of Vammalla 1967? Well, allow me to teach you a valuable lesson in history.  The year prior Finland had come up a bit short on the war reparations paid at the time for the Soviet Union, so in the early spring Chairman Malenkov had made a ruthless demand for the Finns to supply them with massive amounts of gardening tools to make up for the difference. The demand was under a great threat of economic sanctions, which would have halted the vodka importation for an unknown period of time, which was obviously unacceptable for the Finns. Hesitantly the whole nation complied, still recovering from the war at the time, unable to afford any shortage of the precious liquor favored by so many. After all, this was two years before the legislation regarding the sale of standard beer in grocery stores (462/1968) had passed, and proper drinks for Saturday sauna were not as easy to come by as they are today. However, come autumn, come the leaves, and the forests would be filled with the decaying fire hazards the great nation of Finland had tended and cleared out so carefully throughout the centuries with the ancient art of forest raking. The situation was looking very dire, and as the summer was closing to the end, the leaders of the country were desperately searching for a viable solution. But behold, for the great innovation of the nation strikes again. Unknown to the government at the time, the engineers of Fiskars corporation had also foreseen the upcoming travesty and worked hard throughout the summer and had finally come up with a plan just in time to save the nation from nature's garbage. The corporation had started mass-production of scissors almost as soon as the Soviet demand had been fulfilled. It took way less time and resources to produce these scissors than new rakes would have cost, and it was possible to spread them across the country way more conveniently in smaller packages, and to top it all, technically they needed not be categorized as gardening tools, preventing Soviet claim over them. The young nation had been blessed with new hope for a salvation indeed. The scissors were also equipped with orange handles in order to make them easier to locate if lost in the forest, and it was this design that remains iconic to this very day! That is indeed what Fiskars is still the best known for; The orange-handled scissors of 1967! When the autumn closed in and the leaves started to turn the reddish and orange hue, the nation got to work. For the following weeks the Finns cut the leaves down using the scissors and collected them into garbage bags before they could fall down and pollute to great forest floors. And this is how the nation was saved once again!  To this very day the Finns rake the floors of the forests in order to keep their nation safe and sound from the great threats of the nature. The end.",6년 전,2,

@kschantz," Master Exploder     Okay, You asked:   Economy and Employment: Nearly 3 million jobs have been created since President Trump took office. 304,000 manufacturing jobs have been created since President Trump took office, and manufacturing employment stands at its highest level since December 2008. 337,000 construction jobs have been created since President Trump took office, and construction employment stands at its highest level since June 2008. Under President Trump, the unemployment rate has dropped to 3.8, the lowest rate since April 2000, and job openings have reached 6.6 million, the highest level recorded. 67 percent of Americans believe now is a good time to find a quality job, according to Gallup. Only under President Trump have more than 50 percent of Americans believed it is a good time to find a quality job since Gallup began asking the question 17 years ago. President Trump prioritized job training and workforce development to empower workers to seize more opportunities, signing an Executive Order to expand apprenticeship opportunities. President Trump has restored confidence in the American economy, with confidence among both consumers and businesses reaching historic highs. Consumer confidence in current conditions has reached a 17-year high, according to the Conference Board. Optimism among manufacturers has hit record highs under President Trump, according to the National Association of Manufacturers. Small business optimism has sustained record-high levels under President Trump according to the National Federation of Independent Business. President Trump signed the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law, cutting taxes for American families and making American business more competitive. American families received $3.2 trillion in gross tax cuts and saw the child tax credit double. The top corporate tax rate was lowered from 35 percent to 21 percent so American businesses could be more competitive. President Trump has rolled back unnecessary job-killing regulations beyond expectations. In 2017, President Trump far exceeded his promise to eliminate regulations at a two-to-one ratio, issuing 22 deregulatory actions for every new regulatory action. The Administration rolled back rules and regulations harming farmers and energy producers, such as the Waters of the United States Rule and the Clean Power Plan. Regional and community banks and credit unions got relief after President Trump signed legislation reducing harmful requirements imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. Since taking office, President Trump has advanced free, fair, and reciprocal trade deals that protect American workers, ending decades of destructive trade policies. Days after taking office, the President withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations and agreement. President Trump’s Administration is working to defend American intellectual property from China’s unfair practices through a range of actions. The President improved the KORUS trade agreement with the Republic of Korea, which will allow more U.S. automobile exports to South Korea with lower tariffs and increase U.S. pharmaceutical access to South Korea. American agriculture has gained access to new markets under President Trump.   World Politics: President Trump followed through on his promise to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. President Trump ordered an end to United States participation in the horrible Iran deal and immediately began the process of re-imposing sanctions that had been lifted or waived. The President has taken action to confront aggression by Iran and its proxies. The Department of the Treasury has issued a range of sanctions targeting Iranian activities and entities, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force. Under President Trump, the United States has led an unprecedented global campaign to achieve the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. President Trump’s leadership has contributed to the return of 17 Americans held overseas. In May 2018 alone, Venezuela released one American and North Korea released three Americans who came home to the United States. The President has secured historic increases in defense funding in order to rebuild our Nation’s military with the resources they need, after years of harmful sequester. President Trump signed legislation to provide $700 billion in defense spending for fiscal year (FY) 2018 and $716 billion for FY 2019. The United States has worked with international allies to decimate ISIS. President Trump ordered strikes against Syria in response to the regime’s use of chemical weapons in April 2017 and April 2018. The Trump Administration has imposed a range of sanctions on the Maduro dictatorship in Venezuela, including sanctions targeting Maduro and other senior government officials.   Immigration, Borders, and Security: Despite limited resources and obstruction from Congress, President Trump has worked to take control of our border and enforce our immigration laws. President Trump has called on Congress to provide the resources needed to secure our borders and close loopholes that prevent immigration laws from being fully enforced. President Trump authorized the deployment of the National Guard to help secure our borders. President Trump’s Administration has carried out immigration enforcement efforts based on the rule of law. From the start of President Trump’s Administration to the end of FY 2017, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) made 110,568 arrests of illegal aliens. Arrests made in this timeframe represented a 42 percent increase from the same timeframe in FY 2016. Of the 110,568 arrests made, 92 percent had a criminal conviction, pending criminal charge, were an ICE fugitive, or had a reinstated final order of removal. President Trump has made clear that his Administration will continue to combat the threat of MS-13 in order to protect communities from the horrendous violence the gang has spread. In 2017, the Department of Justice worked with partners in Central America to file criminal charges against more than 4,000 members of MS-13. The Trump Administration has cracked down on the import and distribution of illegal drugs in order to stop them from reaching our communities and causing even more devastation. As of April 2018, U.S. Border Patrol has seized 284 pounds of fentanyl in FY 2018, already surpassing the total of 181 pounds seized in FY 2017. The President has launched a nationwide effort to fight the opioid crisis, which has devastated communities across America. The President’s Opioid Initiative seeks to reduce drug demand, cut off the flow of illicit drugs, and save lives by expanding treatment opportunities. President Trump signed an omnibus spending bill which provides nearly $4 billion to address the opioid epidemic. The bill included $1 billion for grants focused on the hardest hit States and Tribes and provided funding for a public-private research partnership on pain and addiction.   Government Accountability: President Trump has confirmed the most circuit court judges of any President in their first year, and secured Justice Neil Gorsuch’s confirmation to the United States Supreme Court. President Trump has signed legislation to bring more accountability to the Department of Veterans Affairs and provide our veterans with more choice in the care they receive. President Trump signed the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017, improving processes for addressing misconduct. President Trump signed the VA Choice and Quality Employment Act into law, authorizing $2.1 billion in additional funds for the Veterans Choice Program. President Trump successfully eliminated the penalty for Obamacare’s burdensome individual mandate. The President’s Administration is seeking to provide more affordable health coverage and broader access to affordable alternatives to Obamacare plans. President Trump has released a blueprint to lower drug prices for Americans. President Trump has ensured that the religious liberties and conscience of Americans are protected and respected by the Federal government. President Trump signed an Executive Order to protect the free speech and religious liberties of groups such as the Little Sisters of the Poor. The Department of Justice issued guidance to all executive agencies on protecting religious liberty in federal programs.",6년 전,0,

When he refers to Sweden (and, in other contexts, Germany or other European countries), he is referring to areas where there is high crime and violence by Arab immigrants.  This si widely reported in conservative media, but never in mainstream media, and has been denied by the Swedish government, although it has fueled conservative movements in European countries.

Get rid of the forest ground rubbish by chipping it all, favour the bigger trees to promote and form a canopy, water the forest with treated greywater systems, make swales to keep water in the landscape to make trees grow quickly and you'll reduce fire risk.

But for some reason, this self-styled 'educated man' takes issue with the term in order to make fun of Trump. And only ends up making himself a laughingstock instead.

People mistranslated the word ""rake"" to mean a regular Finnish ""harava"" without knowing that the English word is used for other things too. Someone tweeted this difference and the forest planning professor replied to that tweet to confirm it and give additional information about it. And later another professor retweeted that tweet. These are forest specialists we are talking about here. And I know Finnish language because I am Finnish. Also, we in Finland don't use a direct translation to ""forest floor"" which is a real English term also. A direct translation to ""forest floor"" would be ""metsän lattia.""

@naplesboy77," @JaimieJo  I now how the Electoral college works. I also know that that the body of the electoral college is a group of individuals who are elected officials of the people they represent appointed as representatives. This is an antiquated system which I feel needs to be revised because it involves a very small amount of people who could have very who may have special interests or gains to make in an election for the highest office. When I state you ""elected him"" it is for the fact that we as a people made it possible and don't seem to understand that who we elect someone to a  minor office it may have implications to play in bigger outcomes. Democracy is fragile and needs to be nurtured. So go out and vote even if it is a small political office because you do not know what may happen. We currently have almost a population of 328,000,000 in the United States yet we have 538 to represent us all in the Electoral College.",6년 전,0,

He did not claim climate change wouldn't be a problem. He said you need forest management. Forest management is what we do, we keep our forests clean (as in: not bushy and wildly overgrown everywhere), we cut our trees when it seems like the forest needs to be trimmed. We try to do this in a way that keeps the forest enjoyable for everyone, including the animals living within the forest. I do acknowledge there are problems with certain species with our forest management scheme, but that's why the state owns and controls pieces of land.  Oh, and just to clear this out, in Finland everyone is allowed to enjoy the clean and well-kept forest no matter where or who you are and who owns the forest. There are some exceptions to this, but the forests are open and free for everyone no matter who owns them.",6년 전,0,

What if that one source gets in the hands of some bad dude(s) and the bad dude(s) starts to manipulating the news you see. Since you only watch one source you would never find out. The bad guys could basically tell you anything. Aks yourself this? Do you EVER doubt anything your news source says? Or is everything they say by definition true to you? Can't you see how easily they could make you believe whatever they want?  I sure doubt the many I have. I watch many and draw my own conclusions.  2. Calling everything you don't like fake news... well, it's just stupid and you know it, you are not a toddler. 3. ""Nasty third world hypocrite"" Sigh. You could not be more wrong. I'm not nasty, I'm not from a third world country and I'm not a hypocrite. However me stating that without evidence doesn't make it true (it is, but I don't want to proof it to you). Your statement could be true, mine could, but without evidence it is just pointless shouting.   I'm perfectly comfortable where I live. We have free healthcare, free education, everyone can go to college if they want. I don't need to lock my doors, we never ever had a single school shooting in my country. We can't be laid off from work without serious misconduct (stealing, fighting or something else ridiculous), if we are laid off, we get compensated one month of salary for each year we worked + bonus. We don't have the huge drug and murder issues that US big cities have. It's save to walk outside in our big cities or anywhere else at night. I can hunt where I live. I'm free to smoke weed if I like (I don't like it), drink what I want (I'm not a drinker either), eat what I want.  We are also free to end our own lives if we are terminally ill. We are free to marry whatever sex we want. We are free to have any religion or no religion that we want. We don't have to pledge to some flag at our schools or sing the national anthem. We are also free to choose from more than two political parties (thank god).   I have travelled the world. I think the US is a beautiful country, I'm a big western horse rider myself and visited Texas many times.

It looks like this: https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MEDIA/stelprdb5177289.jpg  That said, the thing about Mr. Trump is that it is doubtful if he actually knows what this is.  He is a master at repeating words that he has heard without actually knowing what they mean.  The growth and dead matter that collects on the forest floor insulates the ground.  Removing it exposes the soil to the air and sun, causing it to dry out.  The trees die due to a lack of moisture, causing even larger stuff that will burn, dead trees.  Mr. Trump simply does not understand that everything has multiple consequences. Forest management isn't simply ""raking"" the forest.    Reservoirs have a maximum capacity before they become damaged.  The cannot simply collect all the water from the seasonal rains.  Once at max capacity, the excess water has to be released.  Health insurance companies cannot simply cover all pre-existing conditions at affordably priced premiums without industry wide risk management.  Mr. Trump said, 'Nobody knew health insurance could be so complicated?""    And there is the problem.  Most people knew, everybody in Congress knew, everybody in the health care industry knew, everyone in health insurance knew.    Mr. Trump doesn't know.  He doesn't know what he's talking about. He doesn't know what he's saying.  Day in and day out, we watch as Trump makes ridiculous statements about things he knows nothing about.  Day in and day out, the White House scrambles to ""explain"" what he meant.  So when someone says, ""This is what Trump is talking about"" or ""This is what Trump meant"", the simple fact is that no, it wasn't and no, he didn't.  Trump had no clue that there is such a thing.  He still doesn't know that there is such a thing.    As he has said so often,  ""Maybe did, maybe he didn't"", ""Maybe things will work out, maybe they won't"", ""Who knew it could be so complicated."",  ""Nobody knows""........

Over here the property owners get together before the fire season and discuss where we will cut breaks and then we share our labour and do the job.

It's like people have pointed out that raking is a legitimate part of forestry, but not Trump's understanding of it, where he clearly believes it's like using garden rakes to gather leaves. Trump is like Cliff from that old show ""Cheers,"" a blowhard who insists on expounding on areas where he has no expertise, and the limits of his knowledge become painfully, laughably obvious.",6년 전,4,
@AirCrash1," @pataplan  But Seth is ridiculing him for his choice of word which is in fact the correct word for describing the ground in a forest. We would cut our fire breaks a few months before the dry season then rake/clear them of flammable material by burning the breaks a month before dry season. The key was to burn the breaks after the material we cut down had time to dry but not when the woods were already too dry. Most fires you have to deal with are when people burning their breaks lose control of the fire but you never burn them when it's windy and the canopies of the surrounding trees are not dry enough to catch a light.  If you just rake/clear your breaks then you have to monitor the breaks because the fire can still cross the break albeit at a much slower rate. If you cut then burn the breaks then you can forget about them, no fire will not cross via the ground We would keep in touch in the dry season and if I fire was spotted we would work out the direction it would go and the wind conditions. If it was windy we would rush out with chainsaws and increase the size of the breaks in the direction the fire was heading and then spray water onto the canopy of the trees on the opposite side of the break from the fire. Only one rule in fighting and preventing wild fires, remove the flammable material. No heroics are required you cannot fight a wild fire, you cannot even get close enough to attack it with water hoses. You get ahead of it and cut breaks, it's not rocket science if the whole community gets involved you can stop any wild fire.

Just a sudden pick up in the wind can send a blast of heat so intense that it can fry you. The key is to burn fire breaks before the dry season and defend those fire breaks, we didn't even have access to water most of the time, so we would all carry fire beaters, which is a broom handle with a piece of car tyre attached at the end which you use to beat the fire out on the ground, we all stand in a line on the other side of the fire break, usually about 100 of us then we use the beaters to beat any fires out that start from embers blowing across the break.

Sweden -- would have to do with my dear friend Bill Zola, who moved there last year, to work against Donald's efforts to free me, thinking that Donald was not trying to help me; Finland, had to do with a rude three-month ex-boyfriend, Steve Conte, who's truly ""weird"" sexual recollection of me, and equally weird sexual demands of me, were damaging to me in ""this mess,"" for years and helped ruin my life.  Many people don't realize that Donald Trump has been battling organized crime, who are behind what happened to me and consequently the world.  The ""Admiral Navy Seal,"" whom Donald was referring to would be my college ex-boyfriend and the love of my life, Admiral Colin Kilrain, who was closely affiliated with Barack Obama.  Barack Obama was instrumental in working toward turning me transgendered.  The Pakistan reference was about my beau of three years, Sohail Saeed Shiek, whom, I believe, may have been implicated unfairly in 9/11.  The Democrats want to ruin Donald and put me underground again -- to use my energy -- and to, indeed, turn me transgendered, for labor-relation reasons, and to obtain a vast and growing population of votes, which, is also mob-driven.

@kellyowens1868,"+ Askal Tesfa +  Actually if you knew anything about world politics, you would know that our president was right that as it says in any dictionary, nationalism is a synonym for patriotism, not an antonym of patriotism, as Macron tried make his countrymen believe.   Macron did this because NATIONALIST parties, and governments are winning election, after election throughout Europe.  The popularity of nationalist parties, just caused Angela Merckel, to announce her retirement soon, from German politics.   Returning to Macron, it was a French  nationalist party that he barely beat in a run-off election, to become the French president, & if that same election were held today, he would lose in a landslide. Macron's popularity in his own country, is half, or less than 50%, of the popularity  President Trump in the US.  Obviously Macron's speech denegrating nationalism, was meant for his domestic political audience, especially to keep ""THAT WORD,"" from regaining it's original meaning.   His popularity shrunk to 20% in France, and that was before the massive riots around Paris, this weekend, protesting his policies, and newly instituted gas tax hikes.  I'd bet you any amount of money, that our President is more popular in France, than Macron is.   Trump's policy on immigration, is supported by the vast majority of French citizens, as is Trump's policy on international climate agreements, hence the huge riots this weekend. Ironic, considering the latest round of climate accords were signed in PARIS.   Then again that agreement has proven to be an international ""virtue signal"" about reducing carbon emmisions, that created nothing but world-wide hypocrisy.  None of the top 11 carbon emitting countries, met the targets of carbon reductions, they had promised to reach.   The US, who pulled out of the agreement, as Trump promised to do, during the 2016 presidential campaign, did reach the targets of carbon reduction, originally set for it, under those Paris accords.            In yet another example of the president actually being right on a subject,{If you ignore the non-funny comments of the former comedians, turned political pundits, on late night TV.}, the legislature, in my home state of calofornia, just passed 2 bills, to do exactly what President Trump recommended they do to reduce the severity, and number of wildfires that continue to ravage, the over grown, and fuel-heavy forest, and wildland areas, near populated areas.  As someone evacuated from their home for 10 days, only a couple of months ago, (because of the largest wildfire in california history), I can assure you that the restictions on clearing the forests of the fuel loads, especially the millions of dead trees due to a beetle infestation, by regulatory overload, or actions taken by myopic environmental groups, that have all but eliminated controlled burns, and dead timber removal efforts, have lead to the huge increase in the number of large wildfires, and their severity, in this state.  The fig-leaf, ""global warming's"" 1° temperature increase, over the past century, can't cover up for the incompetence, and deriliction of duty, by state forestry officials, and the ""environmentally-minded"" politicians, who have made the fire problem, what it is todaly in my fire ravaged state.  There are indeed natural factors that play a factor in these fires, but these are caused our natural 7 year drought-heavy percipitation cycle, know as El Nino, and El Nina.  They provide forestry officials with a predictable schedule, of when controlled-burns will accomplish the most benefit, in terms of fire prevention.  When you have ignorant politicians, in a one- party state, passing increasing numbers of regulation, resticting their use, and environmental zealots, blocking timber sales, which are one of the best fire prevention methods, that studies have shown, these fires are to be expected. One bill provided $ Billion Dollars, over five years to clear forests of the burnable undergrowth, that has been fueling many of these rapidly moving wildfires, and the other bill removes some of the restrictions on controlled burns, some of these same ""virtue signaling"" politicians passed, not that long ago.   You can see why they would blame a nebulous force like ""climate change"", than the very policies they have been forced to repeal, that have cost so many of my fellow fellow californian's their lives, and their homes.  I was nearly among their increasing number, as the latest fire, in my area, burned within 1/4 mile of my home.  Isn't odd that there was almost no coverage of these 2 bills, in the media.  I'm certain you hadn't heard of these concrete actions aimed at fire suppression,[Which are FAR TO LITTLE, far to late, and should have been ongoing all along, instead of increasingly proscribed, or resrcted.] until I mentioned them to you.   Do you think it's because they are exactly what the president brought up after our Lake county fire months ago, when he identified our crazy water regulations, that have added somewhat to the overall issue, and this time when he mentioned ""clearing the forest floor"" of the burnable fuels that are the problem.  This idiot joked about a NY City, real estate magnate, calling it a (forest) ""FLOOR"", but as a former boy scout, long-time back packer, and resident of cali, for more than 5 decades, it has always been called the ""FOREST FLOOR"", there is no other term for it, & that is a perfect example of why these former comedians, are no longer funny.  No one who knows much about forests,   or wild fires, would see any humor in stuff like that, that is wrong in the first place, politically motivated nonsense, and just UNFUNNY .......                                                 .

@crypticnomad,"There is very clear evidence that scientific journals and academic scientists are biased when it comes to social hot button issues(also known as ""Publication Bias""). Just two months ago a group of scientists were able to get numerious fake papers printed or past the peer review process simply by taking the side of the masses. They came up with conculsions that were on the side of the social hot button issues and then made up statistics to back their points up.    It is a fact that there is a 97% concesus among scientists that climate change is man made but the reality of the situation is that the majority of the evidence that they site doesn't actually support that hypothesis. For example, the chart I linked to in my first comment clearly shows a strong correlation between tempature and atmosperhic CO2 levels and also clearly shows that the current levels are not the highest that there has been since man has been on the planet. However, correlation doesn't mean causation. Roughly 125,000 years ago there was a spike in global tempature and CO2 levels that surpassed today's levels by a fairly large margin and there is absolutely no way that it was caused by man. This isn't the only data that shows this same point. In fact if you carefully read some of these papers they all but ignore historical tempatures/co2 levels and all but completely ignore the Milankovitch cycles. Basically global tempatures/co2 levels rise/fall based on how close the northern hemisphere is to the sun(also called axial precession). The vast majority of the papers supporting man made climate change simply look at the data starting from the industrial revolution which ignores the fact that the tempatures have steadily been rising for the past 15,000-20,000 years(roughly the time were we entered the current interglacial/interpluvial period) and ignores the fact that we're nearing the typical point where the tempatures/co2 levels take a drastic nose dive.  The Royal Society’s official motto is “Nullius in verba,” Latin for “Take nobody's word for it.” Ironically, the Society and the broader scientific community rarely practice this approach when it comes to climate change or other hot button issues. The reason that I said ""ignorant religious stance"" is that just like with the majority of religious people they take a position and stick to it regardless of the underlying facts otherwise known as ""Willful ignorance"".  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/interglacial https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Willful_ignorance",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@robin-hr9up,"President Trump’s critics are belittling him for not buying the lefty narrative that global warming is to blame for the California wildfires. Instead, Trump points to decades of mistakes by government agencies that caused the woodlands to become overly dense and blanketed with highly flammable dead wood and underbrush.  He’s exactly right.  Just ask California officials. Two months ago, the state legislature enacted a measure that would expedite the removal of dead trees and use “prescribed burns” to thin forests. In other words: the very same reforms that Trump is now being mocked for proposing. The September law followed a Gov. Jerry Brown executive order earlier this year that also called for “controlled fires” to improve forest health. This scientific approach isn’t easily conveyed in Trump’s preferred mode of communication, the 280-character tweet. But University of California forest expert Yana Valachovic conceded in a Washington Post interview that Trump’s “general sentiment is correct — that we need to manage fuels.” That is, to get rid of dangerous build-ups of dead and dying trees. For a century, forest mismanagement has resulted in huge blazes. And while global warming is the favourite culprit among the PC crowd, history shows that California suffered far bigger fires decades ago. The death toll from the current northern California fire, known as Camp Fire, set the gruesome all-time state record for a single blaze, killing at least 79 so far, with hundreds still missing. But that terrible death toll is mainly owing to the fact that population density on the forest’s edge has expanded rapidly in recent years. In 1936, fires state wide burned nearly 800,000 acres, five times the size of Camp Fire. Fires in 1934, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1950 and 1963 also vastly exceeded Camp Fire’s size. Yes, Trump’s Twitter bombast doesn’t capture every policy detail. But his basic point stands. Sadly, his liberal critics can’t see the forest for the trees.

It is also true that in FInland there is not so much these kind or problems and there is good reasons for that.  You cant maybe compare Finland and California, but same time Finland's neighbour countries Russian and Sweden have these kind of problems so what is difference in Finland? Authories have clear plans how to react and will react fast and very powerful when there is any single marks that somewhere is burning. Also citizens are much more careful. Authories try prevent these fires before something happen and when something happen so they react very fast. I think that even finnish forest companies are helping prevent that not any fires happen.

They may opt to abide by BOTH the law of the land and the dictates of their religion in these cases. But this occurs UNDER the umbrella of existing law. It cannot supersede the law of the land nor be used in place of it. ALSO, it is only for legal proceedings that have to do with relational matters such as divorce, property disputes, and the like.   Churches often offer such services, as do synagogues, temples and — YES, mosques.  When two Muslims decide to go to their Mosque to resolve a dispute, they will look at the dictates within Islam which is Sharia.

Between 30 and 5 feet, the goal is to landscape and design so the ground fire loses steam, by removing fuels like tall grasses and wood piles.

@alphanada,"Alexandra Mac, you are correct. One of the most important elements in Forestry Fire Fighting is creating fire breaks, like you described. This is done by hand, and with machinery. The objective is to separate leading ground to discourage or minimize the continuity of the fire/flames, as well as keeping access roads open, and for creating on-the-spot temporary shelters for the firefighters if the flames are catching up to them too fast. It is a constant process, extremely laborious and physically demanding. The methods of Forestry Firefighting are much different than for structural/city/town firefighting. The preventive ""raking"" of ""the floor"" that the President speaks of is a misinterpretation on his part. Removing flammable debris from the ground is not a year-round preventive clean up, like removing the grease from a kitchen hood or something like that. ""Raking"" (not usually done with a rake) is part of cutting off the path of the fires, once it is known where they are tending to go to, in an effort of staying ahead of them. Sometimes this works, sometimes the fire overcomes even the cross paths that were previously treated.",6년 전,1,

The people Trump would hire will, naturally, be the best people, so figure they can rake an acre of forest in 2 hours. They can rake all of California's forests in just 41,984,000 hours. At 40 hours per week with 2 weeks of vacation that will provide jobs for 20,992 people. And then you've got to haul away all the leaves and bushes (don't forget the bushes they rake in Finland). More jobs. Hauling jobs. Mulching jobs. Maybe road building jobs to get to all 20,992,000 acres of raked forest.  And then think of all the other places with forests. Most states aren't as big as California, but all told we can rake 10 times as much forest. That's 10 times as many jobs. Almost 210,000 jobs!

In Finland forests are kept under control by diving them in to smaller areas and surrounding them with effective road systems. I think the fact that Trump even discussed the issue with Finnish president Niinistö shows that he´s willing to learn & find effective solutions. Trump clearly pointed out that Finland had their own system for forest fires. He doesn´t have to know every single trivial detail.

Its actually also totally acceptable term and part of the actual cleaning up process as a Finnish forest expert later commented after he saw what the media was trying to do. (google; ""stump rake"")  The media in their Anti-Trump prejudice acts like nitpicking children instead of focusing on the main point, which is the Finnish forest fire prevention system and how it, or parts of it, could be used in the US. Finland has significantly less forest fires even when compared to other Nordic countries with similar terrain. At some areas in the North of Finland there is even dry soil (More similar to California) The Finnish and European media tries to use every opportunity to make Americans seem dumb. And when there is no reason for it, they try to spin things or they write some hacky hit piece. It doesn´t necessarily have to have anything to do with Trump, but Trump is the first US president to show the middle finger to the cocky eurocrats.",6년 전,5,

@RevieCliche,"Although what trump said was dump,  he's not entirely off the rails with his statement. There are fire smart programs that reduce the amount of ground litter (dry dead organic matter) in the urban forest interface and also include making sure there aren't trees with 10 metres of structures. Obviously these programs are meant to be for only near urban areas and not the entire forest, but by reducing the amount of fuel you create a fire break in these urban forest interface areas which can reduce the severity. So while raking the entire forest is a ridiculous statement, the concept isn't entirely wrong. I will also say there has been a mismanagement of forests. forestry and fire suppression has decreased the diversity of tree species and tree stand ages, creating massive monocultures of old/ dying/ dead trees. Along with the increase in temperatures and droughts from anthropocentric climate change, we have created a recipe for disasters, and they're not going to stop till there's nothing left to burn.",6년 전,0,

@justanidiotsodonttakewhati7248,"Actually, ""the forest floor"" is a more specific term that denotes an important part of the ecosystem which constitutes what we call a forest. It is the part of decomposing organic matter that establishes after ""the forest"" (the sum of trees) has been established.  Such as leafs, etc. which form a layer on the ground. Taking care of the forest floor in such a way as to not disturb the eco system beyond necessity and yet minimize fire hazard is rather important. If too much is left for decomposition in an area that gets very dry during summertime (or in other ways is susceptible to wildfires), it can act like an ""ignition / fuel mat"" by which fire spreads far more rapidly than by, say, from tree to tree. Hence becoming much harder to contain within as short a time frame as possible. Further, the denser a forest floor that catches fire, the greater the probability of extensive root fire. Which should be avoided.  I'm not a huge Trump fan, but give due where it is. Taking care of forest floors is important people. Here in scandinavia forest management is a five year university education. Not that people go around with rakes like 1600 century farmers, nor that inattention to forest floors should be solely blamed for an increase in wildfires.

Trump seemed the picture of health. He stood 6 feet 2 inches with an athletic build; had played football, tennis and squash; and was taking up golf. His medical history was unblemished, aside from a routine appendectomy when he was 10.  But after he graduated from college in the spring of 1968, making him eligible to be drafted and sent to Vietnam, he received a diagnosis that would change his path: bone spurs in his heels.  The diagnosis resulted in a coveted 1-Y medical deferment that fall, exempting him from military service as the United States was undertaking huge troop deployments to Southeast Asia, inducting about 300,000 men into the military that year.  The deferment was one of five Mr. Trump received during Vietnam. The others were for education.  His experience during the era is drawing new scrutiny after the Muslim American parents of a soldier who was killed in Iraq publicly questioned whether Mr. Trump had ever sacrificed for his country. In an emotional speech at the Democratic National Convention last week, the soldier’s father, Khizr Khan, directly addressed Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, saying, “You have sacrificed nothing and no one.” NOW TIME TO SHUT OFF YOUR BIG MOUTH N BABY BRAIN",6년 전,0,

In many Forrest there is potential for regular burnoffs but if we have burnoffs the temperature may raise slightly. But if we don’t have burnoffs then the Temperatures and fires rise substantially!! So by not burning off small places and dead brush irresponsible Forrest management which is politically correct but not ecologically correct. What he did talk about with Finland was  burning off brush so it doesn’t contribute to massive fire spreading, But he didn’t say that in order to avoid backlash, that was weaker than he should’ve been. California is irresponsible about forrest management it’s true their inability is due to the political climate , which is self fulling and primarily a major contributor to global warming.",6년 전,0,

They took one word (raking) out of context and tried to make it seem like Trump wants to cut all forests down. In Finland forests are kept under control by diving them in to smaller areas and surrounding them with effective road systems. I think the fact that Trump even discussed the issue with Finnish president Niinistö shows that he´s willing to learn & find effective solutions. Trump clearly pointed out that Finland had their own system for forest fires. He doesn´t have to know every single trivial detail.

Watch a Planet Earth episode.  Also, raking undergrowth prevents a ground fire from involving the tree trunks and canopy and canopy fires are what are spread so fast that people can't escape.  Make fun of how dumb he sounds (and saying the President of Finland told him about raking was pretty dumb sounding) all you want but he's not wrong.  California's fire problem does stem from a lack of management stretching back to the 50's.  One controlled burn got out of hand so they abandoned the practice, now they have 60 years of fuel and the climate is only getting drier and the problem is only getting worse; compound that with communities expanding right up to the edge of ecosystems where fire is a natural part of the cycle and you get large scale property damage.  I feel for the victims of these fires, I really do but the fires are the predictable result of a chain of events.  Laughing at Trump's remarks (while usually justified) overlooks the fact that the answer isn't to stop climate change (though, that's not a bad idea) it's to live in harmony with our ecosystem in general and understand environmental risk.

@lelandlewis7207,"Trump would have to diss Bin Laden since Bin Laden was an actual multi-millionaire and the Bin Laden family business is an actual construction business with actual multi-billion dollar cash flow and assets; and they didn't do it by bankrupting businesses, playing the tax system and screwing over contractors and employees, they did it by building.   Osama's father actually started out on his own with little to no education and built his business, not by taking millions from his father and bankrupting everything in sight.  Not only that, where did he think a man in hiding from the whole western hemisphere, Europe and most of Asia would be hiding?  The penthouse at Trump tower Pakistan, with gold toilets and a big pool on the roof?  With Trump's lack of common sense and lack of knowledge on how the world outside his towers works, that's probably where he would ""hide"" if he was on the run.  Then he'd blame Hilary, the Democrats and all of his aides for getting caught and throw everybody he could name under the bus.  Trump is an absolute hypocrite.  Look at his calling for Hillary Clinton to be jailed for running a private e-mail server, something that has been shown to not be a breach of security or illegal, but overlooks Ivanka using a PUBLIC e-mail account for government business which is as unsecured as you can get.  He himself uses a cell phone that is known to be open to hacking and probably listened to by the Chinese.  Trump is nothing but a blow-hard and an out-and-out liar.  He has already admitted to it in an interview, so it should be no surprise that he continues to do it.

@ILuvAyeAye,"The US doesn't really import that much oil from Saudi Arabia. As of 2015, the US produces 76% of the petroleum they consume (petroleum is a broader category that includes crude oil, refined oil products such as diesel, biofuels etc.). The US actually exports more petroleum than we (I'm from the US) import. And the majority of what the US does import comes from Canada, not Saudi Arabia.  Saudi Arabia matters to the US for a few reasons. When it comes to oil, it doesn't matter who ""gives"" the US oil - if Saudi Arabia starts exporting less oil, it will raise the price of our oil regardless of how much we buy from Saudi Arabia. The US doesn't buy Iranian oil when the sanctions are in place, but still, Iranian oil production affects our price of oil - because when Iran produces less, Asian countries (which still relied on Iran's oil) need to buy more from countries the US buys from, so there is less for everyone, so the price rises. That's how international economics works.  But I suspect the US tries to stay friendly with Saudi Arabia more because of military reasons than economic ones. This is grossly oversimplified, but Saudi Arabia is against Iran, Iran is against Israel, we're friends with Israel, and the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Saudi Arabia also helps us out in some ways when it comes to maneuvering with Iraq and Afghanistan, although they also seem to be helping our enemies as well. It's very complicated, and I'm not pretending to get all of it. But I think the focus on oil is a bit of a red herring at the moment. Stability in the oil markets is always nice, but I don't think it's the US's major priority at the moment.",6년 전,0,

@syror5000,Im from Finland and own forest. He is not completely incorrect.  By raking I think he means clearing the smal brushes. That is what we do two times in a 80 year period before we cut all trees and then replanting them. Finland has better forest management than Sweden. At least we have much less forest fires even in same climate. Trump seems to look how we in Finland manages forest and that's a wise thing.,6년 전,2,

There have been about 80 smal fires this year but got stopped thanks to fast reaction. But Finnish firefighters had to go and help Sweden this year. There it has been worse. If I understand it correctly we are using planes that checks for fire when there is high risk. So we can react fast.,6년 전,2,

@RLaraMoore,"The scientific terminology i believe is to refer to the ground level in forests as the ""forest floor"".  Finland correspondent was likely asked if he used the word raking? ... perhaps he didn't use the word rake,  perhaps used words like cleared or removed?  This comedy sketch is full of (albeit humorous) misrepresentations. People are mistaking humour for truth and accuracy. ThAT is very concerning.  There can be many truths in a Lie, there are no lies in truth.  This POTUS has been the most transparent, action taking, putting the country's long term best interests as priority, and that, while being the most interfered with President we have had in a very long while.  I suspect he might be the most intelligent president we've ever had considering his IQ and ""Chess Game"" like strategic thinking. And obviously a very successful individual in life and business.  Perhaps this is why so many do not relate to him, or have difficulty comprehending his foresight. He is not a typical politician; he lacks the salesmanship schmooze and charm that the too many Americans are apparently more familiar with and enjoy the being seduced by hidden self-serving charisma. (poor sentence structure, I know, but hopefully my point is clear)  I may not agree with everything this POTUS proposes, but I do appreciate and value his intelligence, honesty and integrity.  And forest management iS a huGe key to why the drought affected California fires have been worse than prior years. The forest floors shouLd have been cleared of excessive dry fuel long ago as these areas become more populated, instead of just recommending  meager ""defensible space "" clearing per individual choice. It would also be a wise to require fire proof or fire resistant roofing on all buildings in the areas, and to also find solutions to manage risks due to utilities, electrical wires etc, during high winds. It's not entirely the Utility companies' fault that wind causes trees to spark on wires that are there because of people choosing to live in these areas.  Of course it's not the dry brush and ""leaf litter"" fuel that cause these fires. The POTUS is addressing the immediacy of diminishing the damage and loss that occurs in these fires, and, it is logical that if the dry brush is cleaned, cleared, ""swept"" ""raked"" ""vacuumed"" or bulldozed away, that there  wiLL be less opportunity for the fires to travel and cause as much devastation.  just my thoughts. ^.~",6년 전(수정됨),0,

The biggest problem with forests fires is they are natural occurrences that used to burn the old dead parts of the forest now we are so good at fighting fire that the dry wood builds up more giving fires more fuel when they finally do happen. Basically we disrupted the forest fire cycle in a way that gives out of control fire storms more potential for destruction.

@ledward1248," @joyphillips1821  Did you only read the headline of the article you linked and not the actual article?   The article states that while Obama, on that particular Memorial Day, did not go to Arlington he went to honor fallen soldiers at Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery on that Memorial Day. Trump decided to stay in because it was raining. Obama showed up while Trump did absolutely nothing. (It's not in the article you linked but on the Wikipedia page for Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery there's a picture taken on that very day of Obama at the ceremony).  Most of the actual veterans quoted in the article you linked to (two out of three) applauded Obamas' actions.  According to the article you linked to Obama had a better record of attendance at Arlington than either George HW Bush or Ronald Reagan and equal to George W. Bush.   According to the article you linked to of the last 6 presidents only Bill Clinton attended for all 8 years of his presidency.   According to the article you linked to George H.W. Bush never attended.   Not only is your comment an irrelevant deflection it is a very bad deflection that completely disproves the point you are trying to make. If not showing up at Arlington Cemetery on Memorial Day is a sign of hypocrisy then it's Republicans that are the hypocrites - that is the conclusion to be drawn from the article that you provided.

@richarddefortune1329," @carmelochemtrailskiller8770  why do you need to know someone identify to have a constructive conversation? The admiral served honorably his country under Bush when Saddam Hussein was captured, then under Obama when Bin Laden was captured. How relevant is it to point out that he's a Hillary or Obama backer? Again, saying that Osama bin Laden could have been captured a lot earlier, as if that depended on the admiral, just proves how ignorant Trump is. As our president, he's supposed to know that was not the admiral job to locate Ben Laden. Some people, like the admiral, earned their right to speak by serving their country, while others, like Trump, are worse than politicians and only know to be critical of others.",6년 전,1,

@codyluke63," @emilyb.8219  people defend Trump with the stupidity and uselessness of Obama because you leftists have a double standard that needs to be called out. You'd rather Hillary was in office committing crimes and getting our servicemen killed than Trump. He's an asshole, but he has our best interest in mind. Why can't you see that? Your governor Brown is a disgrace. My sister was raped by an illegal immigrant and that man is hiding in your sanctuary cities. How many people did Obama and Hillary kill in the middle East with drones compared to how many people Trump has killed in the middle East? Now there's a fun comparison, right? The Bush family wins the who killed the most battle and they were corrupt Republicans. The reason I trust the bumbling Trump is because he's not a politician. Not a Republican or Democrat. This party thing has divided us, maybe the best way to unite is by finding the middle ground and create a new party, or get rid of the far right and far left. They're the cheaters, the killers, the racists, the fringe who's voices are the loudest on social media and the talk shows. The middle is where we should all live.",6년 전(수정됨),1,

Then I grew up and actually thought for myself and here we are, thank God. ""If you don't support Trump, then that means you want our military members to get killed"". That's a fucking bullshit argument and you know it. I didn't vote for either Trump or Clinton in 2016 because I didn't like either of them, though looking back, I regret not voting for Clinton over the serial disaster we have in office now. You are truly deluded if you think Trump gives two fucks about everyday, middle class people like you and me. He's lived in an ivory tower his whole life and has always been rich. But yeah, he's totally on the side of the little guy, right? That's why he appoints other wealthy, inept people to government positions, because he has our best interest at heart.

Trees and plants and insects depend on forest ground cover to live.If you raked the forest floor of it's ground cover you'd eliminate forest fires until the trees died from the floods laying their roots bare.No nation has EVER practiced forestry and fire prevention by raking ground cover.Do you have any idea what it would take to rake the millions of acres of forest in CA? That makes about as much sense as Trump saying forest fires are due to the lack of foresight of CA officials who allowed all the bodies of water to drain to the Pacific ocean.Remember that doozy? If only we'd dammed every river into a lake and never let a drop reach the ocean all we'd need would be giant 20 mile long fire hoses eh?,6년 전,5,

Mun ystävällä on yks kiva tuttu presidentti rapakon takana, joka sai mahtavat veroetuudet koko perheelleen. Ettekö vain kaikki rakastakin sellaista kaveria joka hankkii kaikille kivoille kavereilleen verohelpotuksia? Miten mahtava kaveri sellainen kaveri onkin. Ja tuttavallisille rouville ja herroille hankki myös verohelpotuksia, kun ovat niin kovasti tehneet työtä ansaitakseen rahaa. Olisihan se väärin jos ilkeä valtio antaisi niitä rahoja köyhille. Se olisi valevaltio sellainen valtio. Totaalisen valheellinen. Estäisi kaikkia tekemästä omilla rahoilla mitä  haluaa, vaikka ampumaan rahoja meren ylle kauniina väreinä, tai muurille kiipeäviä valemaahanmuuttajia. Ilkeä valtio olisi sellainen, totaalisen laiton valtio.  Sen isoisä tai jokin muu esihistorian sukulainen tuli joskus maahanmuuttajana maahan, mutta ei laittomasti. Se olisi väärin.

Mutta eivät valkoiset ihmiset tee mitään laittomasti, ne ovat kivoja ihmisiä, ne käyvät solariumeissa myös. Sitten ne muurit pitäs rakentaa ihan myös merien rannoille, lentokenttien ympärille. Voisi joutua vielä toritkin ympäröimään muureilla, että kansalaiset sais olla vapaita.   Ei olisi kivaa sillä mun ystävän tutulla presidentillä, vaikka siellä muurit ookin maailman parhaita, ei ole mitään Berliinin muurit sen rinnalla. Jännä muuri, muuri on jännä. Rajoittaa vapautta, mutta sen voi vapaasti rakentaa, se on jännä. En mainitse tässä että se maa on Usa siellä rapakon takana, koska siellä voisi toreilla ihmisiä harmittaa. Siellä on maailman parhaat yhdysvaltalaiset torit. Ei ole muualla niin yhdysvaltalaisia toreja.  En viitti tässä sanoa sen Trumpin nimeä, ettei sille tule paha mieli.

While California has a Mediterranean climate, with arid deserts to temperate rainforests and mountain ranges, but has been suffering from heat and massive droughts for years now, made worse by a lowering of the water table due to massive water consumption from agriculture and cities and digging of ever more wells. California's forests are adapted to regular small wildfires; the decade-long obsession of preventing the smaller fires, as well as increased growth of grass due to changing rain patterns in recent years, has let to flammable underbrush piling up resulting in huge fires that kill the trees. Climate change is real; it doesn't magically start fires, but it increases temperature extremes and changes air and rain patterns. But constantly ""raking"" the forests so that they look ""tidy"" would also be a bad idea ecologically, as animals and young plants are dependant on the cover and nutrients provided by slow rotting dead leaves and similar.  North American soils originally knew no earthworms, so flora and fauna adapted to slow recycling of lead litter by bacteria and fungi... all earthworms they have now are invasive species brought over from Europe over the past centuries.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@c.s.7521,"I am starting to wonder if Trump has Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome. Korsakoff syndrome, a neurological disorder with neuronal loss, caused by a lack of thiamine (vitamin B1) in the brain, which can be the result of chronic alcoholism, thiamine deficiency from dietary deficiencies, mercury poisoning, dialysis, chemotherapy, or just old age. One of the typical symptoms is ""confabulation"" (false memories): the patient will invent false stories about events that never happened and then become convinced they are true. Other symptoms include lack of insight, disinterest in new things (apathy), euphoria, fixation amnesia (loss of immediate memory, being unable to remember events of the past few minutes), blackouts, false recognition of places, mental excitation, and in severe cases anterograde or retrograde amnesia. Which is why Korsakoff syndrome (also spelled Korsakow syndrome) is called _amnestic-confabulatory syndrome_.  Korsakoff syndrome often comes coupled with Wernicke encephalopathy: damage to the Wernicke area in the brain's temporal lobe region, an area involved in the comprehension or understanding of written and spoken language. Wernicke encephalopathy is characterized by the presence of changes in mental states (confusion), unsteady stance and gait (ataxia) due to lack of coordination of muscle movements which can also lead to slurred speech, and a weakness or paralysis of the extraocular muscles of the eye (ophthalmoplegia) resulting in odd or slow eye movements.  Wernicke encephalopathy is also called receptive aphasia; patients demonstrate fluent speech output but have difficulty understanding the content of written text and spoken language. Therefore, they may produce a large amount of speech without much meaning, and are not aware of their errors they are making while speaking. Their writing often reflects speech in that it tends to lack content or meaning.  Those are all symptoms that fit what we have seen from Trump: Confabulation, inability to concentrate, confusion, unsteady gait (ataxia), slurred speech, rambling nonsensical speeches and tweets (aphasia), sudden emotional outbursts, disinterest in learning new things, lack of insight. And how much of his protestations, when caught in a lie, of ""I never said that!"" are conmanship and how much is caused by amnesia or dementia, we can't say for certain.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

He controls his supporters through fear and anger. And therefore, rot in hell for unleashing this plague on the rest of us, who hate and deplore him. He brings shame, dishonesty and disloyalty to a new level. His daily ramblings are total nonsense, make no sense at all and divide us further every day.

@arishasmile1905,"So yes no one is raking, specifically, but clearing of small woody shrubs and debris (to remove potential fire fuel) is basic forest management. I really hate trump, but I think we are so ready to jump on him that this is the wrong thing to focus on. ""The floor of the forest"" sounds wrong and weird, but clearly he was mixing up the phrase ""The forest floor"" which is a common term. Furthermore, while it is super dumb to deny and ignore global warming, forest fires are not caused by global warming. Rather, in California's case, it's due to a buildup of burnable debris. Fire suppression is such a big issue and goal, that rather than small, natural regular fires lighting, removing the debris and dying out - California does such a good job of suppressing fires that the debris just builds up and builds up. That means when a fire does get even slightly out of control, it spreads with unthinkable speeds, eating all of that debris. The only place global warming comes into it is that the air quality can make fighting fires tougher or easier, and the fires could potentially be caused by lightning, and there is an increase of lightning storms in California, I believe.

@EmilyPorter," @lilaclizard4504  Yes, the irony is Trump always says we need more guns to stop gun violence, but he neglected to argue that we need more fires to prevent ""fire violence""!  We do control burn in some places, but it needs to be done a lot more. Historically the landscape of America was more park-like in many areas because small fires would start periodically from lightning, and because indigenous people started fires to increase certain types of plant foods for themselves and animals, which benefited the whole ecosystem. The ash increases soil fertility, and big fires happen less because there isn't enough brush built up. Goats are another option used in some places. They can eat up the brush and poop out the nutrients. There is also a movement to reintroduce more  beavers to California to create more wetlands in areas that were historically swampy. And we know how Trump loves the beav! He's missing out on so many opportunities to be right for once.",6년 전(수정됨),2,

@lilaclizard4504," @EmilyPorter  rofl! I've never thought of that gun/fire thing, but such a great comment :))) Great info all round, thanks :) I wasn't sure the extent of traditional burning there, so sounds like it's probably similar to Australia, in which case there really does need to be more controlled burns. Goats are an awesome option too! Are there wild/native species who's numbers can be increased? We don't have that option cause all our trees drop poisonous laves (eucalyptus), but someone should REALLY look into that in more detail!   Here we had a situation years ago where National Parks would buy cattle farms where there were lots of endangered native animals to protect them, only to have the animals move out of the new national park & onto another cattle farm, because the conditions suited them better. Eventually they grew some brains & just started funding conservation programs on cattle farms instead, but makes me wonder if you may have a similar situation, where the right kind of farmers & right kind of subsidies might create more natural/traditional looking land & better land management in some areas, farming goats in forests maybe?",6년 전,2,
@lilaclizard4504," @mennovanderveen7086  yeh controlled burning in Australia is huge! It's summer here now, so totally wrong season for it, but with climate change, it's a nightmare to try to do even in winter, so we do it whenever possible, meaning even now some is actually happening. Here's a map of current bushfires in Sydney https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/fire-information/fires-near-me  7 bushfires,  1 grassfire  4 hazard reduction fires (deliberately lit controlled burns)  That site btw is always active & being updated, anytime we smell smoke/can't see out our door cause it's so thick, we can go there & see exactly what's going on in our area & if we need to think about evacuating. Once it reaches ""emergency warning"" sms's are sent to all mobile phones in the effected area advising of the fire, if evacuation is recommended/mandatory & where evacuation centres are located (it's very rare we have mandatory evacuations for fit healthy people who are prepared to fight the fire in well prepared homes, but for everyone else, they are highly recommended in many settings & centres set up to encourage compliance - not that you need prompting with the level of smoke & automatic fear that goes with that!)

The founding fathers did not think the American populace was capable of choosing a president (as most were uneducated at the time and perhaps at this time as well). It was a fail safe that failed because the delegates did NOT do their intended job. If at anytime the American people were to vote in a candidate that was unfit for office the delegates were SUPPOSED to vote for the candidate that was in the best interest of the country as a whole. Not bipartisan, not to enrich themselves but for the good of the nation. The problem is these delegates did not do that.  In the end the core of the American government has been forgotten or eroded over time. We are fast moving away from the brilliance of her Democratic structure to something that is a not even a pale comparison of what she ought to be. It deeply saddens me. Our democratic infrastructure is in dire need of reform for all our sakes.

There is an effort to collect twigs and other clutter to be burned in power plants and systems for monitoring the forests for fires so that they can be put off early.   California has 8 times the people of Finland for a land area that is just a third larger. Even if there are dry conditions around the year, there's no excuse for large areas of forests to be burning every few years.

@ivonedefigueiredo9301,"tdot22   The man stated a fact.  A fact about how the Finnish maintain their forests.  I don’t understand why you would think +jormapeikko is bigoted.  Of course Finland and California have different climates, but that does not mean that Finland doesn’t have climate change effects.  It may not seem as dramatic as those in warmer climates, but it will be dramatic enough for them (actually, for us world, we are world citizens and everything is connected).  Losing a glacier could be catastrophic and traumatic.  I’m not saying it’s happened, I’m trying to illustrate a point.  According to a study (4 years old, so may not be totally relevant now), Finland is the place on earth where temperatures are rising the fastest.  In any case, cutting down of diseased etc. trees is a way to manage a forest.  I have no idea what species of trees exist in California (except Redwood’s, everyone knows about them, but I’m not sure if they have them where the devastation occurred), but they may also be highly flammable due to their make up, as are many cypresses especially.  Trees high in oils and resins tend to be a problem, so the hotter the climate gets, the worse it becomes in terms of devastating fires.  The only thing to do is develop a strategy of sustainable management, or this will only get worse.  Something that isn’t often mentioned, is:  1.  just how much of your forest is “natural”,  2.  how many invasive species exist in the forest, etc.  We have changed our planet and even if we have purely natural indigenous forests, they are small pockets managed by us, so in reality, they are no longer totally natural.  This doesn’t help Australia too much because their natural forests are gums which are very flammable, but thinning out, sustainable harvesting, and a healthy forest floor is important.  In South Africa we need to do controlled burnings in certain of our natural areas because these areas are isolated and the animals that live in them no longer roam all over their natural terrain, causing imbalances, so we construct fire breaks and do controlled burning, which in itself is unnatural because it is done by humans and cause other complications.  All countries have to face complications due to climate change.  We should not bicker and should simply work together to solve the problem.  Cleaning the forest floor (which is a real thing) is a method, but you need to ensure enough is left to sustain a natural ecosystem, if possible.  I believe that logging causes buildup in areas because they fell the trees, remove all the branches and leave them lying around, taking only the valuable timber.  Forests are tinderboxes if we don’t manage them sustainably.  We have had hundreds of years of unbridled consumerism, so we have lots of data and expertise that knows what we’ve done wrong.  We must collaborate to fix it.  Sorry for the tome.  I guess it’s one of my pet peeves.  I still don’t think +jormapeikko was being bigoted.",6년 전,1,

Trump wanted to diss California, and that’s what he chose to do it, just like he blamed Puerto Rico’s economy when they were devastated by a hurricane. Then he cuts funding for maintenance of forests. Thanks for the input in what will become a point of ignorant contention among Americans, sadly.",6년 전,0,

I have not heard the story's that Trump is to blame for the fires. I do however know his comments about how to deal with the fire and blaming the fires on poor forest management. Trump also does not have a great track record for funding the Forest Service and BLM land. In Mt his 2018 budget  “More than 50 EPA programs” would be eliminated entirely. His proposal makes Forest Service and BLM land 100% responsible for payment of fighting forest fires. Just Forest Service bill alone will be around $2.4 Billion each year. That is on top of Federal Funding cuts to the services totaling in the Billions. So Mr Trump would like us to keep the forest cleaned to prevent wide spread forest fires but is cutting funding by billions of dollars and placing the cost of any Forest fire on the State... The solution is available to prevent these fires, We just need the people with the knowledge making the decisions and not Mr Trump. 💖💖💖💖",6년 전,4,

This and it was at this point sepparated in different fractions - from left to right. I mean Bavaria was mostly something like a sovjet state back then with Munich as heartland of the NSDAP... Gouvernment was splitted into 7 or 8 parties if I remember correctly, while moste people living back then didn't have any experience with democracy, as the German Reich just fell 12 years ago. Most people were born and raised under an absolute Monarchy and were craving for one strong leader to help them out of the ditch.

The extra embarrassing part is that the current California fires did not even start in a forest. How does ""raking"" the forest floor help with a fire that's not in the forest. Explain that. Also explain how the National Forest service is going to ""rake"" the forest floor after Trump cut their budget by $170 million dollars.",6년 전,0,
@arcajeth626," @LovinglfDesigns  Trump will have to increase the budget if this method is going to be used.   It isn't simply raking leaves and I think you know it.  Clearing underbrush and debris using machines and removing all that is gathered.  You do this in swaths, not to the whole forest.  Thinning the Forrest also helps.    The grass fires are much trickier, but I think planting trees to create a break through the huge patches of grassland could help.   Forests are a natural windbreak and once full grown, trees only really burn if there is a lot of fuel on the forest floor below them.  Many species of trees rely on fires to clear the brush from under them so that their seeds can grow.  Some species cones can lay dormant for decades until a fire blows through and opens then up releasing the seeds.",6년 전,0,
@LovinglfDesigns," @arcajeth626  I'm familiar with the process needed to create firebreaks. It's labor intensive and requires ongoing maintenance. Fires have always been with us as they can occur naturally with lightning for example. The question is whether this method of forest floor clearing is the most efficient or cost effective for limiting fires in a state that was stricken by drought for 6 years and where high temperatures are breaking records. Given that fires can occur anywhere, including outside the forest, a comprehensive, well-funded plan (that looks at all options available) is needed to address all eventualities. I see that we agree on the funding at least. Hopefully effective pre-planning can limit costly loss of life and property as just occurred in Paradise and other parts of California.",6년 전,0,

@blueckaym,"""forest floor"" is a real term, and it doesn't mean just the ground, but all the typical stuff that fall on the ground.  ""It mainly consists of shed vegetative parts, such as leaves, branches, bark, and stems, existing in various stages of decomposition above the soil surface."" (wikipedia) So in this sense Trump actually used the expression correctly (yeah I'm amazed too!) However the ""forest floor"" is also very important part of the forests ecosystem, and I'm not sure how ... err practical it is to rake it regularly (or what the effects on that ecosystem would be) Anyway my point is Trump is dumb enough to give you 10 new stupid things to laugh about before the end of the day, so no need to twist his words ... he's doing fine on his own ;)",6년 전,74,

It's an active dynamic ecosystem that is vital to forest growth holding water, preventing erosion and mostly being habitat for fungi and microbes that fix the nitrogen into the soil for plants to access. trump learned a word so let's not debate that let's hope he learns the other words too. Maybe he will learn the difference between forest Management and landscaping. If he were to say we should create fire perimeters around our towns, villages and outposts. Removing dead stand trees and fallen trees, thinning thickets, removing low hanging dead branches from mature trees. clearing woody material that can fuel fires to make a buffer perimeter to provide a cushion to escape an approaching fire then that would make sense and that is what we already do. Raking is not a very important part of fire prevention. Things above ground level burn better. A management plan doesn't stop the fire threat. The purpose is to slow the advancing fire enough to widen the window people have to escape. the Camp fire was anomalous with hurricane force winds driving an electrically sparked fire no management could slow or mitigate the event. It would be far cheaper to convert all remote locations to solar and remove all above ground high voltage feeder lines than to have 1 mile perimeters raked around all our forest communities. trumps comments and suggestions are insulting to forest managers deeply steeped in a fire management crisis caused by a changing climate that trump says is a hoax.",6년 전(수정됨),6,

@tetryl1,"Yea, we don't ""rake"" our forest's here in Finland anymore than any other country. By raking he might mean that we kinda do clean out the mess after trees are cut down. We do care for our woods very much. But honestly it has nothing to do with why we don't have huge forest fires, neither is that done for the purpose of preventing fires. The clean out is done only to use the ""mess left behind"" as an energy source after or to utilize it in other ways. Only reason we don't have massive fires here is because we do not have California's climate. Our climate is mostly utter SHiiieeeT, if it's not cold, it's wet. This summer we had almost a straight month of very hot sunny weather and this was most likely the longest hot streak ever and the hottest too. If some idiot would throw a cig out on to dry grass or anything in the woods it might be enought to start a fire even here in raking Finland and wild fires are very hard to stop unless you're very fast. If you're gonna blame something for the California's fires, start with idiotic people who do throw burning cigs out on dry land or maybe go camping and start grilling some food in the wrong place or don't put it out after...

@sevengenerations8879,"Raking the leaves ... 9:08  step back for a minute and realize what every media outlet is missing: the firefighters were creating a firebreak with a tool called a McLeod (not a rake). In optimum conditions, a bulldozer will clear the majority of brush, firefighters then clean up any flammable ""debris"", then ""fight fire with fire"" (Sometimes, a bulldozer is not available and the firebreak must be created completely by hand). Depending on a number of conditions (wind speed, wind direction, etc.) the firebreak can be made several hundred yards ahead of the oncoming fire line. After the firebreak is created, firefighters ignite that brush/debris with flares and let it burn back towards the approaching fire line while standing guard with hoses to ensure that the fire they created doesn't jump across the firebreak and spread further. This allows the fire to burn out in a controlled area which is then ""mopped up"" for hot spots. Fighting fire with fire this way is an effective technique that has been used for decades. It is stupid to try to ""chase"" an out-of-control fire; it is best to advance in front of it, create a firebreak, and burn the foliage in a controlled way to the fire line. Once it's burned, there's nothing left to burn.  ... the media should stop chasing after these Trumpian out-of-control fires of stupidity and start to be more pro-active about the extreme dangerousness of this orange buffoon with malignant narcissistic personality disorder because he is an absolute threat to our national security ...",6년 전,0,

For something to be an accomplishment you have to show some causal relationship between the effect and the proposed cause. We can demonstrate that Trump's attempts to castrate the ACA have caused millions to lose health coverage. And we can show that hos tax cut is doing very little for most Americans, and actually was an increase on many of them, and that most of the benefits go to the rich, and it is causing a massive increase in deficit spending. We can see that his tariffs are costing American jobs and hurting many American industries - especially agriculture - probably for years to come while also driving up inflation which means real wages are going down.

@AlashiaTuol," @Ana_crusis  Well here's an update to ""Modern Thought"" - maybe talking down to entire groups of people and thus creating an us vs. them mentality is why authoritarians are coming to power all over the world?  Here's another modern thought: when you lecture the obvious to a group whose members either, a). already know everything you're saying, or b). refuse to believe you, you make things worse, not better. You feed the victim mentality of those who disagree with you and like Trump and think that foreigners are the enemy, and you come off as a condescending asshat to we who've known since before Trump's election that he was bad news and did and still do everything in our power to subvert his authority, rubbing the horrible reality we actually live in in the faces of people who can't do anything anymore but hope and take action where possible.  I'm tired of people claiming this is funny, or condescendingly giving advice as if we're stupid for not doing the obvious. It's not funny. A lunatic with the maturity of a five year old who would watch the world burn rather than let someone else be at it's center currently has the US's nuke codes. The republican government is systematically challenging basic rights for women, lgbtq+, and minorities. The Supreme Court has been stocked with an illigitimate, stolen seat and an emotionally unstable, vengeful, clearly biased asshat with an agenda against the progressive party. Children are being locked in internment camps. Thousands died in Puerto Rico because the US government didn't care enough to send adequate help to its own citizens in the aftermath of total devastation, which the President blamed on Puerto Rico. Mass shootings are occurring everyday. And while all this happens, Republicans spend their time slipping through bills stripping birth control from health insurance coverage and making it increasingly difficult to for women to get abortions, because that's their priority when their country is literally on fire and hundreds are missing, and when dozens a day are being shot, and when the suicide rate has spiked in every state. And somehow, somehow, 35% of US citizens - or 80% of the Republican party - approve of this administration. And because of how corrupt  the system is, basically everything has been tilted in the favor of the Republican minority.  Our government doesn't care about us, and living here is hard enough, you condescending asshats. Go ahead. Continue laughing at others' suffering. Take a page from Mareen Logan up at the top and make fun of a country for its dead children.  And know that the part of you that does is justifying the victim mentality of the worst in our country by being just as unfeelingly, uncaringly evil as Donald Trump.",6년 전,1,

Not to mention, if u died in the line of duty & your widow/widower said anything that wasn’t “nice” about our President, he would ignore their grief, have no respect for their spouse who just died for our country, & would react by lashing out, bashing them & insulting them as they prepare for your funeral. He would not show any sincere grief or any respect for u or your family, & he wouldn’t even go to the cemetery to show he cares & supports the troops.

@burdine26.120,"5:02. Expect wildfire spending to increase with climate change inaction.  Expect “wildfire spending to continue increasing as climate change presses a trend of more and bigger wildfires nationwide.”  (AP 2013, Jeff Barnard, Associated Press, “$40M request to pay record wildfire costs deferred,” Seattle Post Intelligencer, Friday, November 22, 2013)  290 million metric tons.  Amount of carbon dioxide released annually by U.S. wildfires.  “Wildfires boost concentrations of carbon in the atmosphere for only a few years until the carbon returns to the forest in the form of new trees and vegetation. But fossil fuel emissions, mined from deposits hundreds of millions of years old and burned quickly to power electricity-generating turbines, are a much more significant source of increased, long-lasting atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. ‘From a human perspective, that’s new carbon,’ [said Jason Neff, a professor at the University of Colorado in Boulder, an author of a 2007 study that examined U.S. wildfire emissions.].  Neff’s study shows Idaho wildfires from 2002 to 2006 sent an average of 14.3 million tons of carbon dioxide skyward each year. There’s a margin of error of over 8 tons, given inexact data about the blazes’ extent and the nature of the material that burned.  Meanwhile, the state’s coal-fired electricity — produced in Nevada, Oregon and Wyoming by plants owned by Idaho utilities — likely emitted over 6 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2012, according to several reports, including one from Idaho Power Co., Idaho’s biggest utility.  Nationally, Neff’s study — funded by the National Science Foundation — estimated U.S. wildfires release about 290 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, amounting to 4 percent to 6 percent of America’s carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel burning.  Power plants account for 40 percent of the nation’s carbon dioxide emissions, with most coming from burning coal at plants such as the Jim Bridger facility in Wyoming, which is co-owned by Idaho Power Co. and PacifiCorp.”  (Rexburg Standard Journal 2013, “Otter takes on Obama over carbon dioxide rules,” Rexburg Standard Journal, Boise, Idaho, Wednesday, July 3, 2013)  In 2015, fires started by electrical lines and equipment accounted for more than half the area burned in Northern California.  “But humans are a huge factor in the fire equation. Climate change and forest mismanagement have exacerbated the danger in California and elsewhere. Moreover, human activity causes most of the burning; in 2015, fires started by electrical lines and equipment accounted for more than half the area burned in Northern California.”  (San Francisco Chronicle 2017, Chronicle Editorial Board, “Editorial - California fires’ overlooked consequence,” SFGate.com, San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco, California, Friday, November 24, 2017)",6년 전(수정됨),1,

BTW the high number of reported rapes is actually a good thing because it means that victims feel safe to report their assaults to the police simply put, Sweden is believed to have about as much sexual violence as any other place of its size it's just better at getting people to come forward and classifies what sexual assaults differently than the rest of the world",6년 전,0,

@KirstiStephenson,"My family is from Finland.....and NOBODY knows WTF Trump is Talking about!....First of all....Finland and California are Vastly different Ecosystems! Finland has a TON more Water in its Forests, lakes, rivers, and run off from snow in mountains etc. And most areas that are Forested are not densely populated like most of these California areas. So we have WAY Less instances of Forest Fires! Not to mention California is so over developed that has taken away alot of its natural water resources, but that is a minimal fact in relation to the increase in Temperatures over the last 20 years due to Climate Change! Combined with Incredibly strong, dry, unpredictable Wind Systems which can carry fire for miles in the air and start massive house fires from a lightning strike fire miles away.....It has very little to do with the ""Forest Floor"".... There are also massive valleys in between the forest areas that are simply miles of dry brush! So if a forest fire starts....you have miles of fuel for that fire.....That is a natural ecology....you can't 'Rake Up' miles of dry grasses that are an important part of the ecosystem, are too large to eliminate, and would totally destroy the natural growth! It's a major dry, arid climate. I have friends in the LA, Thousand Oak and Malibu areas that have tried to do things to their house like add metal roofing instead of wood, adding special glass and bars to their windows, trying to keep a water bumper around their property etc.....but these fires are the WORST in California History! If miles and miles of land are on fire and fire is being driven and fueled by the wind.....nothing will stand in its path, no amount of water or ditches can stop a Disaster of this magnitude.... People need to be more bloody careful with their campfires that's what started the one huge destructive blaze that claimed so many lives and destroyed the town of Paradise, but barring that....if there is a natural fire that occurs from a lightning storm and is near urban areas, there is not alot to do to stop it except get out of its path.....we don't have Fireproof Homes! These Fires are Massive and Devastating. Mother Nature will always win against Humans whether it's a massive fire, tsunami, earthquake etc. It's a horrible fact of Life.

@Kilmoran,"@UClkMG3hrBhik_-6LdCN4tYQ  I disagree that it is merely patience. But i also completely agree that it is my opinion that that is the case and I don't know what is going on through their specific heads. But let's use the Boss analogy as almost anyone can follow that. When your boss is doing something you /know/ is going to cause more grief for the employees and more losses for the company as a whole, and you also know that when ever this Boss is approached about such issues, respectfully or not, they tend to double down or ignore the problem to even worse results, almost no one will directly tell them that. Why? Because they are patient? No... because they know that only a few things are likely to happen. They will just be fired and removed (if they are reporting it to that boss directly, remember that there isn't anyone above this Boss though in this scenario), or they will, due to you knowing how they react to criticisms, make the situation even worse. This may be possibly looking for other critics of their plan and firing them or penalizing them in some way, or pushing forward even faster and harder because they are certain they are correct no matter what they are told which causes what ever issue that decision is going to cause.   I am not at all saying no one agrees with Trump, or that they are stupid or evil for doing so (at face value...), but I am saying that he has a record of acting just like how i've described. When the EPA and scientists working for the government speak about the dangers of certain practices regarding extracting gas or oil or climate change, he fired most of them, replaced some of them with people who literally have the exact opposite stance, and allowed for them to waste lots of money for stupid reasons for months at a time. Only to come back later and start to think that Climate Change may not /entirely/ be a Chinese Hoax after all. This is not making up stories or being hyperbolic... this is literally exactly what has happened during his administration.    So no... I don't really think it's just ""patience"" we are seeing for their boss.

@Palmieres,"tl;dr The POTUS has the RAM of a mechanical calculator.  Afforestation or forestation (which Trump apparently heard correctly) is the practice of planning wooded areas with specific species being planted strategically in order to define areas where potential fires are less prone to spread too quickly. Apparently what the President of Finland was talking about was how they draw a plan to make their forests less likely to feed a wildfire, by using the characteristics of certain trees which are not as combustible as others, to define borders within the forests themselves.  For example, the fact that much of California has seen an increase in numbers of eucalyptus trees in the last century makes it a high risk area for wildfires. Eucalyptus trees soak up a lot of the water in the soil, their sap is highly flammable and they grow incredibly fast, covering wide areas which end up with no botanical diversity. This means that any area where you have nothing but eucalyptus trees is going to burn almost uncontrollably. With trees growing too close to the roads any fire can cross them with just a little bit of wind, and the fire fighters have a harder time finding viable paths to fence the flames.  For contrast, the massive redwoods have evolved to grow their bark in a way that makes them less liable to burn (almost like asbestos). They also contain no resin or pitch, so they have virtually no fuel to feed a fire, compared to pine or eucalyptus trees. Sadly, trees with these characteristics are disappearing and being replaced by more economically viable species. There's also the issue of cleaning up the forests, which is basically something people used to do when they collected firewood, and no longer do in modern times, leaving the forest floors covered in dry material that adds to the problem. As for climate change, yes, it's relevant. Higher temperatures in later years have dried out the vegetation faster and in larger quantities, and rain is coming later, so there's no humidity to help prevent the potential for fires and a lot of stuff that's bone dry and just waiting to burn. So Trump heard the words, recorded some random ones and failed to understand cleaning a forest isn't done like his gardeners at Mar-a-Lago clean the golf courses. It's not with rakes, it's with massive initiatives which involve privately and publicly owned wooded areas being trimmed, cut or burned in a controlled manner during colder weather in order to avoid fires in warmer months.",6년 전(수정됨),3,

@LordOrwell," @justsayin5209  I can't what i said that you asked that about, so i'm going to assume it's vet related.  Trump has done, among other things, the following for vets:  In 2017 he increased the GI bill to cover an entire college education and housing.  He extended the voucher program for veterans who want to use their own doctors, and in one year it will be replaced with a better program.  He also increased the funding for it.  He signed an executive order guaranteeing free mental health for vets returning home for one year minimum.  He just donated three months of presidential salary to the Dept of Veterans Affairs and another three months to a non-profit that helps veterans.  We've never had it so good.  My step dad is also a veteran and not only is he getting free treatment for ptsd, they helped him find an apartment and paid application fees at every place he applied at.  They also put him and his wife in a motel for a month while looking.  These are all new benefits that didn't exist two years ago (except the voucher).    It makes me SICK that people talk out their asses saying he's done nothing for us when he clearly has done more than anyone else ever did.  Heck he's even got a program going to help vets with felonies.",6년 전,0,
@mow1416," @swirvinbirds1971  I disagree. When Hillary commented about the Trump followers so negatively, anyone on the fence went for Trump. In my opinion, Hillary took to much for granted, especially in the swing states. And as for the blue wall, she totally ignored these states altogether, and this was her doom. I believe she also lost, because of Obama's 8 years. All the racist whites who hated him, because of his color, came out of their holes and voted for Trump. I hope our country is ready for a female president. I have given up on the males. It was the perfect storm, for the lunatics to take control. I actually wanted Bernie, but the Democratic party got their way and lost all of his voters support. I am hopefully optimistic, after seeing the results of the mid term elections. I now predict a victory, for us in the next election. Why? The women and young voters have had enough of the orange plague.That said, I also predicted Trump would never win, and was i totally wrong.

What I'm afraid of is that we're seeing a lot of the bigotry, racism, white nationalism etc mindset coming up here.   When Ontario voted Doug Ford in, my heart sunk. He is literally using the same playbook as his  brother (which I personally think 4-5 saw how popular Rob became by doing crap and saying ""ya, so what?!"" & then getting an invite on Kimmel, he prob thought 'hey, I've done way worse, I can win! Or be extra popular' That's basically how he ran his campaign.....and won)   Think of who Doug was pandering to when one of his stupid campaign promises was the 'buck a beer' thing. Ugh - I'm all for cheap booze but the quality has got to suffer, no? And is that really a reason to shift the government? I would support whomever had a sensible campaign. Kathleen Wynne had to go, she really should have passed the torch to someone else because she was so disliked, then maybe Liberals wouldn't have lost to buck-a-beer dude.  Doug Ford is Canada's 4-5  We need to be careful. I'm not against the Conservative party, I'm against him as the leader of the party. I've voted for both parties in the past  - like I said, if someone comes along with sensible ideas, a great campaign and will right the wrongs, I'll seriously consider them.

@TMercan31," @BlackEpyon    oh totally - I honestly think that Ivana is the reason he got as ""famous"" as he did.   She was the one with the work ethic, she was the one that whipped that hotel into shape. He repaid her by taking all the credit & partying all over town with women that weren't his wife, having his babies & running the business.   After they divorced and he had to commit bankruptcy all the dirty laundry came out. That's when all of his super great ideas came out and fizzled away - because she wasn't there to see them into fruition.   He just had ""yes"" people around him telling him what a great idea NY tap water in a bottle labeled Trump Water would be, so he probably said ""tremendous! Do it!"" but maybe it was Eric or DTJ who were in charge? Cause he sure af didn't do any work.  I heard that - allegedly - he got fired from The Apprentice and that was the real reason he ran for Resident (he doesn't deserve a P in front of that because he literally is just a resident, he does no work.... Except for Put in that is) plus he hated Obama & he saw he had ppl supporting his bid.  I don't think people realize how disasterous he is for both Canada and Mexico not just America and for the rest of the world for that matter. Everything he says and everything he does affects everybody else around him, every other country in the world. For some countries it's great what he's doing but for most it's horrible.   The worst part is it's impossible to avoid him or ignore him because he talks 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year, most of the time it's nonsense because he's trying to distract from what a crap job he's doing or the illegal things that he's doing and getting away with.

There you go again, spouting all those liberal lies about how Trump hasn't been the greatest presidentever, and asking those silly questions like ""Has Trump benefited our economy?""  I mean, isn't it obvious?!  Just look at the way the economy has continued going up on his watch, at or slightly below the slope of the line established by Obama!  ""Has Trump given us more jobs?""  Of course!  I mean, not as many as Obama did, and they're mostly in industries like coal that are on the wrong side of history, where there's not a lot of room to make new jobs in the industry and there's a lot more room in renewables.  But, still, he's given us plenty of jobs.  And boy howdy has he been good on the military front!  On Trump's watch, ISIS has lost the supermajority (>80%, last time I checked) of its territory,  and there's no relevance in the fact that that success was based on plans that Obama made and set in motion that didn't have enough time to come to fruition before he left office.  It happened during Trump's administration, so he gets the credit!  And sure, the lying media might point out the fact ( https://www.macrotrends.net/2488/sp500-10-year-daily-chart ) that the stock market has lost all the value it created in 2018, but that isn't Trump's fault because...reasons!

One synonym for stupid in Spanish is pendejo. He says that his grandfather who was a colonel and a fearless man only feared the pendejos. He feared them because they were too many that it was nearly impossible to take them on, and no matter how early you went to anyplace the pendejos were likely to be there already, and they were dangerous since there are so many of them, they could elect the president.

That ticket would have had a lot more pull-power with young voters, and it might have worked.  Anyway, in 2020, Democrats have to pick somebody who can WIN.

@moniquelafontaine4028,"kimberly s - You are so clueless. Trump is the best thing that has ever happened to the US regarding presidents. You are so blinded by all the fake news. Who do you think owns 95% of news media ? Who do you think owns the banks ? Who do you think owns and funds these late night talk show shills ? Who do you think owns all these Hollywood actors and the music industry ? George Soro's and his crooked greedy globalist pals.....that is who. They have had all of the power and have owned ALL of the presidents over the years (that is except Trump). Trump stopped the big globalist money making machine , and Soro's and his pals are pissed, so they use the most powerful tool they own (media) to convince you Trump is the problem. He's not. They attempt to brainwash us 24/7 with anti- Trump propaganda so that fools like you will vote him out, so that they can regain control. Wake up silly little girl !!!",6년 전,0,
@ramonascott-kemp4799," @rogerpalacios6131  thank you for the compliment regarding my name. Odd that there are two of us kids and my father's Latino name, we are Scot-Irish a little Welsh. Not that I would care if we were. I'm sure you probably know a little bit of history of how the Irish were treated when they got off the boat in Ellis island or in South Carolina, Savannah or New Orleans especially during the civil war. Back to your comments - You're absolutely right in that Democrats need to get a hold of themselves and I'm not a Democrat honestly, I want a third party and I want these two parties to just go away! Neither have done anything for the people what they do, they do for corporate America. We need a grassroots movement - including our constitution it is antiquated. We need to change the way our campaigns of run, I've told people on Twitter and everywhere else the best thing to do is ignore Trump. Ignore his rhetoric his childish rantings on Twitter (oh yes it's hard to do!)  just act like he doesn't exist don't play into his hand. In my opinion it's not his anyway, he's being played by the dictators who ""love him"". you just listen to the way he talks about these people and how highly they think of him oh, these are enemies of the state who gives a flying flip if they adore him or not? Democrats must concentrate on what they can and will do for the people and to heck with everything else. I don't want to hear anything about an impeachment, we don't have time to concentrate on that. We have an election coming up a year that is half gone & 2020 will be here before we know it. He's been working on 20/20 since he took office in 2017.  My hope is to someday see a third-party. A Progressive movement forward in  OUR country - We the people. Progressive  positive change to make this a better country. ""Again""? If these people wearing the ridiculous shirts and hats and all the marketing materials sold by the Trump campaign, again know what does that mean? Merriam-Webster's it means to repeat as in other dictionaries - to repeat. Who the heck wants to ""repeat"" what we've already been through? They're not thinking, they should be asking questions, okay Mr. President just exactly what is it you want us to repeat? nothing President Obama did because he like to wipe everything he did from the facts of history!  There's not a problem with asking questions and we should be asking questions everyday. We should be asking questions regarding the cyber-hacking and cyberwarfare - we've already been attacked, what are we doing about that? Not much. I'd have to look it up but you can Google it - the Naval carrier ship Trump wants to ""beef up"" & the Navy came back with no that's not what we need to spend money on,  we need to beef up cybersecurity and that's exactly what we need to do because that is the 'way of the future' that is the new war. I think we're getting the sox beat off of us already, yet so many trumpsters still don't want to believe we were hacked by the RF in the campaign. they think we say that because we wanted Hillary to win, that's really got nothing to do with it the fact of the matter is the RF has a cyber foothold in our country and no one is doing anything about it. Our president will not take a stand. In Helsinki when Putin was asked about his oligarchs hacking into the campaign, his comment I'm paraphrasing but not by much, 'so what if they did they are not the state.' Oh yes they are! if Putin needs money and he needs something done he calls on his billionaire oligarchs to give him money and they do it or go to prison or worse! Obama's biggest screwup was not Benghazi, it was Crimea. even today Trump will not take a stand in regard to Putin and his threats of invading Ukraine just as he did Crimea. of course crimeans are going to say everything is hunky-dory, they dare not say anything else. They are under State sanctioned news they have lost their freedom of speech and freedom of religion. I know missionaries who were there and who had to watch everything they had worked for for over 25 years be toppled to the ground and not only that some of their teachers murdered. KGB style. We have a long way to go, but until we can come together on issues that affect our country and there are so many Democrats out there that are truly conservative people, but when I was in the Republican arena working in the GW campaign, it was as if I couldn't be a Christian if I were not a republican I had to get down off that pedestal and it took one woman to bring me down in that was my Granny God rest her soul. She straighten my little self-righteous and judgmental ass out that's for sure! I'm glad she did she knows that my principles and integrity r conservative yet I am a realist and I know that sometimes people have to make hard decisions and that should be between them and their God! I truly believe Trump brought out their (Republicans) hatred in their hearts a it's become okay to hate and to talk about that hate as if it were okay. I know it was talked about and the campaign 4 GW, and I'm shaking my head thinking what is going on here? I worked for my church as a pro-life liaison until the judges really came down on women who had abortions in the past. Leave them alone they came to the church to repent and to try to get over what they had been through and then these women want to judge them because they are high and mighty self-righteous Christians? Hell no! glad I'm out of that of course I never did go that far, I am an open book I was an unwed mother and I know what it's like because 40 + years ago things were a whole lot different!  I don't understand my fellow Christians because hate is the same as murder and any Christian who has been a part of any Bible study - whatsoever, knows that. I'm a Christian, I try to follow the teachings of Christ, whether one chooses to believe he was a prophet or the son of man, almost every religion recognizes him. I don't thump Bibles. I'll tell the story of the Gospel, which is evangelical -the great commission & one can take it or leave it. I do not believe in forcing my religion upon anyone else, that's wrong and I don't believe in these scare tactics by these moronic television so-called evangelicals - which are supposed to be the same as Christians. The greatest commandment is to love my neighbor and everybody in the world is my neighbor. I am greatly concerned about the world and who's going to get attacked next, is the United States going to invade another country? Yeah I'm concerned about it. The key to what you've said shows me you think for yourself. we just don't have enough people who are thinking for themselves they are following the media, who owns the media? Corporate America. who owns most of our government officials? Corporate America and who owns our president, corporate America. I worked in the corporate arena for a number of years crooks, no integrity do anything to get by and it doesn't matter whether it's right or wrong the bottom line is the profit and doesn't matter how they get it. Christian's keep saying we are a Christian Nation. I know and you know that's not true it's unconstitutional. They keep on because right now religion is running the country big time and they keep this up and we will become a religious State and then they're going to back off and wish to God they had never even thought of it! Separation of church and state is a must especially in a country that has had freedom of religion since its inception - so what are we going to be like Israel and the Palestinians? is that what these people want because that's what they're going to get! As you know religion religious wars have spilled more blood in the world than any  political agenda. Distorted and man-made rules thrown into basic common Sense religion of Christianity which is outlined in the book of Acts and that's it. Again thank you for the compliment, your comments are thought-provoking. that's another thing these people need to be real careful only comes to having a religious state, and they're not going to be able to think for themselves, they're not going to be able to read the Bible and commentaries that go with books of the Bible or verses and come to their own conclusion nope nope they're going to come to the 'states' conclusion and that's it! We have a lot of work ahead. I wish the country as a whole could come together, that's a dream world - I don't think that's going to happen, not in my lifetime, I've lived a hard-and-fast life of 60 years. We must concentrate on winning the battles we can, and perhaps someday we'll win the war. Pick your battles, the ones you can win. What a mess and God have mercy. Thanks! More like you. please look over any grammatical I use text to speech or whatever oh, and this cough I have is driving me up the wall so? Yeah I know my English haha by the way if you ever want to look up something amusing I'm working on and has to do with the way I write in my novel - Google Southonics (suth-on-ics) not yet in the dictionary, but I haven't given up 😉 they actually had the meaning wrong, because it includes southern slang. When I was a kid I called substitute cuss words, I got in trouble for it too. always the little rebel, curiosity killed the cat, but it made a research analyst and a good paycheck! Keep in touch!

Physical evolution has mostly stopped: we change the environment to suit us, not the other way around, but it is interesting the way athletic records keep getting broken.

@dr.redpill353," @barbnecker3054  Barb, while I get it . . . you don't personally like Trump.  I want to ask you. . . do you like Hillary?   Also, there is no way the electoral college can be ""runaway"" any more than voters can be.   BTW . . . BOTH Bush dirt bags voted for Hillary.   BTW Hillary destroyed evidence, Tried to sell US Weapon Grade Uranium to Russia, Ran a criminal enterprise selling her secretarial influence for ""charitable Contributions"" (hence the need for an illegal server to begin with) (Hence the need to destroy evidence under subpoena)   BTW Hillary AND Bill were on the Lolita express.  Her at least once, him 26 times at the minimum.   BTW Hillary's employee was caught smuggling children out of Haiti for purposes of trafficking them.   BTW the body count associated with people  who were ABOUT TO testify against them is at least deep in the 30's by now.   BTW Hillary Clinton AND the DNC purchased and edited the content of the fake Dossier and did so to illegally spy on an opposing candidate.   Number of people murdered / suicided by Trump or to protect him = 0   Number of Children Trafficked for or by Trump = 0   Number of dirt bag deep state Bush scumbags who voted for Trump = 0   Number of times Trump committed an ACTUAL crime while in office = 0   Number of time the Clintons or anyone in the democratic party though the economy could get better prior to January 2017 = 0   The actual likelihood that the Green New deal could work in reality = 0% chance   The idea that open borders is a good idea = 0% chance that its anything other than a complete disaster   Number of countries succeeding with open border policies = 0   Number of countries succeeding with socialist policies = 0   Number of countries with strict gun control with a LOWER Violent crime rate = 0   I'm not saying shootings, I'm saying violent crimes.   There are 70+ nations with more restrictive gun control policies.  100% of them have a higher violent crime rate by population percentage.   Under democratic control: The US has had a many thousand fold decrease in the quality of education   The US has lost military dominance over China AND Russia, making the world a MUCH more dangerous place.   The US had (until Trump) been in a absolute tumble in terms of economic strength in every way to measure it.   UNDER TRUMP: We have the lowest rates of unemployment for : Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Homosexuals, Disabled and Veterans,    The lowest unemployment since WWII for women and White men.   We have the strongest stock markets, the least international aid going to countries that use those dollars against our interests.   The strongest Dollar   Fair Trade globally for the US   The highest personal Income and savings since the 1960's   The death Tax is gone   The capital gains tax now only affects actual millionaires and not small businesses   The Veterans are FINALLY being treated like human beings, because the people who work for the VA can FINALLY be fired if they suck.   We FINALLY have some traction toward enforcing our border laws (with more to go)   We have FINALLY filled over 140 Federal Judge positions NOT filled under Obama.   We finally have a President that has people smart enough to put forth a budget each year.   We Finally have a President that isn't being protected by a left wing whack job liberal media.  That alone is a sign that he is a good man.   You need some waking up.",5년 전,0,

@dr.redpill353," @barbnecker3054  It wont matter if you do. Trump is going to win.  The Republicans will keep the Senate and maybe gain 2 seats, and they will win back the house thanks to: 1) The fake Dossier 2) The Russia Hoax 3) The Fake Impeachment, which every republican hopes Nancy will send to the Senate, even though the battleground districts gain more and more points every week she sits on the fake impeachment.   The best part is the the Republicans will exonerate Trump when he can actually defend himself and call Schiff and Nadler as witnesses and get them to perjur  themselves regarding the invention of ""facts"" during the Russian collusion scam and the fake Ukraine scam.   So go ahead and vote, and participate in the protest of the uninformed.   You are supporting liars, and criminals who supported Bush, Clinton, Bush and Obama for doing EXACTLY the same kinds of things Trump did, only he did it WITHOUT committing crimes, destroying evidence, lying to the FISA court, and INVENTING (fabricating) fake evidence to spy on a political opponent.

@waegele, @matwinner9708  millions of Americans believe he won the 2020 election because Trump says we have election fraud. He has filed dozens of court cases and lost them all. He has no proof but his followers still believe he won. Now I hear he plans to stay in the Whitehouse on 1/20/21. This is the day our president elect is sworn into office . It is crazy here. Trump ran for office as a publicity stunt for a TV reality show. It was meant to raise ratings and was considered a joke. Somehow we got stuck with the idiot for 4 years and he has a cult of angry idiots who  believe that he is great. Hopefully you can enjoy this. We all aren't this stupid but if you go by votes its 45% Trump and stupid people to 55% Biden and people smarter than Trump. I  know that isnt saying much.  Take care and enjoy the show.,4년 전,0,
