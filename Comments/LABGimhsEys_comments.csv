Couldn't find it for years, but I seriously thought this before I saw the tweet, and it's always engraved into my mind whenever i see her in any movie. It's so accurate. Liker her skin tone and the way her lips are shaped just look like a tight butthole about to get wrecked. so gross. If you agree please don't let this die and let everyone know. I can't be the only one who CLEARLY sees the resemblance. Not so much here in this specific video, although I still think so, but in old pictures of her, especially when shes not as made up.

@Abyx_Lycan," @ansh0133  I bet you just feel bad that you didn't grow up in a civilization where technology has advanced and you're stuck in the past. Millenials and Gen Z's have always been put on load. We're fixing YOUR mistakes with climate change. If you think you're so entitled, then DONT bring disabilities into this conversation. You have been incredibly rude to people, and something that people learn in school now is the t-shirt rule: if you wouldn't wear it on a t-shirt, don't say it online. Autism is not a joke. Some people have tough times to do with it and it can effect their future choices. I have a friend who is autistic and his dad died. His temper would always rise and he hated everyone. I've been helping him with this because the world has enough old, sour, dickheads like you. I know right now, that you're probably not reading this, because you're too blinded by your hate for our future generations, that you don't want to be proven wrong. I'm not judging the 'boomer' generation, I'm here making sure that you know that there are real people behind these screens, and that what you say could really effect their life. You say that Millenials and Gen Z's are addicted to their phones. Half of that is true. What you don't know is that phones are very advanced pieces of technology, and every day people are trying to discover new things. You can use phones to make things more convenient, such as you don't have to send letters and wait for a reply. You can just text or call. If you're in trouble, you could call 911. There are educational games for kids that can help extend their learning progression. While I agree that there are some cases where you should learn to have a cut-off point, with certain moderation you can achieve great things with modern technology. If you truly feel that people are still addicted and they won't ever change, read a book. Escape to a world where you don't have to criticise people and you won't be bothered by them. I hope this advice helps, and I'm really sorry if you still can't understand.",5년 전,1,

You said, “...but since this is about a celebrity that’s does not give a damn about anyone on this thread, then I too am not going to give a damn about anyone on this thread” I know that Kim Kardashian probably couldn’t give a care in this world about us, the people in this thread but that doesn’t mean you don’t have to give a damn about us. And how you speak to other people What can I say 🤷‍♀️ human beings like respect, they crave for a bond. It would be much easier for people to respect your opinion if you didn’t weren’t so forward about not giving a damn. And you didn’t fire back at people who think Kim is pretty.

Anyway, negative opinions from people shouldn't be valid to anyone, because it doesn't make you a better person and only has a negative effect. Haters make their opinion as important because they only think of their own feelings and opinions towards something. If you show that you don't care about the horrible comments, they will be more hurt and not you. Anger is a pain and haters relieve from it by hating. So, 1. if you feel sad from what they say, they succeeded, 2. if you stay positive and not care, they fail, and 2. is more important. Who agrees with me?",9년 전,0,

@underground360,Its literally impossible to get this many views in a few days Its been proven and on National News already that Google was busted for manipulating views on many videos to attract attention making the videos look popular so they can run their ads on them to generate revenue. Thats pretty pathetic really with all the videos on youtube showing views in the millions. If you don't believe me research it ITS KNOWN FACTS! Youtube has gone to shit after google took over and won't be long when a new site comes along people will jump the youtube ship like many who already have and went to other social sites. Its an insult that views are manipulated especially for the hard working people who make videos and have their videos frozen at 301 so they don't have to pay partners like us for our monetized videos!!,10년 전,1,

@TheTardisDreamer,"Noah Brady She's always irritating when I see her. Basically she's an exceedingly spoilt precocious moron from what I've heard who's spent her entire life being given everything and has no clue what normal life is. She's one of those people whose family buying her into the industry is the reason she's in it, not her own effort. She's always boasting about her privileged life or complaining about some stupid thing, or claiming that her uneducated, bigoted views on things are always right. She's a total idiot. She said once she couldn't do her six year old's maths homework and yet she claims to be an expert on culture and politics and a high end guest. Imagine a ""Daddy's little princess"" and she's the adult version.    ""We're human beings and the sun is - how can it be bad for you? I don't think anything that's natural can be bad for you.""    “I am who I am. I can’t pretend to be somebody who makes $25,000 a year.” Ugh  She's also constantly making herself out to be Mum of the year in every interview for her occasional (and awful) roles in films and being a Mother, when her children are being raised by a nanny and if she has the horror of having to look after them she'll spend thousands and thousands on absolutely ridiculous means like hiring chefs to keep them entertained or holding private screenings. Then she claims she's incredible for being able to work out when again her children are being looked after by somebody else and she has proven she can't figure out how to look after them without wasting endless money. Her ridiculous claim to be an amazing Mother when she sucks, is her ideas that her children could pick avocados for two years instead of going to school. It's just a culmination of stupid things she's said and her snobbery that people hate. Also one of her kids is called Apple.",10년 전,2,

@LetssTailgate,"That's the thing though. I absolutely love AC/DC (so don't think I'm hating on those bands) but the point is that you can only remember the days of artists like them, because they're in the past. They're not really relevant anymore. You can't have the radio playing The Beatles and Queen forever; eventually people want to hear newer things. Some people, like you, prefer shows/movies/music from before, but you can't expect the new generations to want the same things. Imagine if it was still the 80's and you had people saying ""why don't people listen to Bach or Beethoven anymore, why are they all listening to this rock music?"" In 50 years time you'll have people saying, ""man, what's with all this crap music, what happened to the days of Maroon 5 or Rihanna?"" See what I mean?

@AuronFtw,"belenbutt I agree. Used to be a fan of her, and got mad when she was cast in shitty films like Hick with mostly nobody actors. But then she landed starring roles in stuff like Carrie and If I Stay and they turned out awful - because of her limited range. She wasn't able to play a shy, nervous teenager in Carrie, or any of the range of emotions in If I Stay. She was pretty much just hit-girl the whole time.",10년 전,1,

@mishoa1,"Charizarzar It's not just the tomboyness it's the whole personality and the way they talk is similar. You're clearly a fanboy who can't handle one of the characters you like being compared to someone with obvious paralleling character traits. Naughty Dog looks like they watched Juno and based a character around it and then tried to cover their tracks when people started finding similarities. Ellie is a lot of things ,but I wouldn't consider ""bubbly"" one of them use a better adjective. ",10년 전,0,
@Charizarzar,"Marques Kelley I'm not clearly anything. I don't particularly like Ellen that much as an actress, or at least I don't think she suits this role, and I think Chloe would do better. I can't even name many of her movies, but when I saw Ellie I was instantly reminded of her. If anything you're being an Ellen fanboy/girl. I don't mind if you think she'd be a good Ellie, but your opinion isn't universal fact and I don't really see how her character in Juno is so unique character-wise that Ellie was based around her. And you're getting mistaken. They found similarities in looks, not personality, especially considering the fact that they hadn't even released any information on her relating to what she'd be like as a character.  'Bubbly' is used over here in the UK to describe quirkiness/likeability. Better?",10년 전,0,
@mishoa1,"Charizarzar When did I ever say Ellen Page would be a good actress to play Ellie in a movie? she is clearly too old at this point being close to 30. I was just pointing out the clear similarities between the two. Multiple people including Ellen herself noted the similar look and voice inflections in the first trailer. ND than changed her to look more like Ashley Johnson to avoid lawsuit. I said Ellie has similarities in personality to the type of character that Ellen protray's the majority of the time in her films that's all. Having played TLOU at least ten times and the DLC left behind three times It's safe to assume I'm familiar with who Ellie is. I'm not trying to degrade her character and any way I'm pointing out obvious parallels. As for your choice of actress for the role of Ellie Chloe would be poor from what she has shown us. Her performances in If I stay and Carrie have already proven she lacks the acting skills to pull off emotional depth. That said she is talented, young, and is growing with every role she does. Somebody like maisie williams who already has the experience with GOT and that ""bubbly"" quality you seem to love so much would be better IMO. Now if you're done being misinformed and snarky have a nice day.",10년 전,0,
@Charizarzar,"Marques Kelley I don't see these ""parallelling traits"" though. The original look was the only similarity to me.  Not sure why that's relevant, I've played it around the same amount of times too. we interpret Ellie differently; no need to get defensive.  I think she could surprise you tbh,  but I'm sure there's an undiscovered actress who could also play Ellie just as well. Just as long as it isn't one of the Fanning sisters!  Not sure what I've said that's ""snarky"", especially considering the fact that you immediately addressed me as a ""fanboy"", so don't be a hypocrite. Not sure why you're getting so uppity over my choice of words either. It's a discussion about actresses, it's not supposed to be a heated debate.",10년 전,0,
@mishoa1,Charizarzar you yourself already said you're not a fan of Page and couldn't name her movies how could you possibly debate against weather or not Ellie has similar traits?  I didn't  immediately address you as a fanboy I did after you tried to discredit my claims of similarity with no logical reasoning.  What's wrong with the Fanning sisters? they at least can give believable emotional depth. Not that I would want either one as Ellie they don't have the look or mentality. ,10년 전,0,
@Charizarzar,"Marques Kelley I was talking about Chloe's movies. I was just specifically talking about the roles she impressed me in. Regardless, I've clearly mentioned a few times that I've seen Ellen's performances, so that makes no sense.   I haven't tried to do anything. In fact it was you who entered my conversation with another person in the first place expressing bewilderment at someone daring to have a different opinion.

Someone they apparently don't like or don't have an interest in and say something mean to them? People these days... I'll never understand. If you don't like or have an intrest don't look at them. I swear some people spend more time lingering around shit they dislike than the shit they do like. you would think theyd be paying more attention to the things they do like and not so much their dislikes. NOPE. Lastly... Famous people are human too. They have feelings too. They're the exact same as you and I only they're known and rich. People disgust me. I can't even. ,10년 전,0,

Those that do believe that are either just too young to understand or they are just ignorant (to put it mildly).

He rebelled against God/Jehovah (even though God gave him a high station in Heaven, he was not satisfied and rebelled) just like you rebel against God. When Satan rebelled, he became the father of evil. God wants you to make it & wants you to be saved and to have a new character about yourself. He is giving you time to change through Christ (2 Peter 3:9 speaks on how people are mercifully being given time to be saved & repent). Satan does not want you to make it. He is against God and Satan is determined to not end up in Hell alone...he is going to make sure to take lots of people with him (so he works on people to turn people away from God and Satan also helps people to do other wrong things).

@CalLady79,"naihanchin Kempo Nope. Lily Jane is sharing God & Christ because she wants to share the gospel to help others come into faith. But when you are an unbeliever (as you are), you would try to make something negative or silly about being being of faith. People are free to comment about all kinds of stuff on Youtube (or any site allowing comments, for that matter), but I bet you won't pounce on people for commenting on everything else. As soon as someone wants to share faith in God & Christ, all of a sudden it is a ""problem"". And there's nothing arrogant about wanting to spread something as life-changing and good as God & Christ. But being insulting (which you do unsuccessfully, since people will continue to share God's Word and continue to seek faith) is an example of arrogance. The false bravery people get when they are behind a keyboard and a screen causes them to do all kinds of weak and negative things like faith-bash. It makes you look bad, not us.

@CalLady79,"jamn610 The things mentioned in the Bible are actuality and as far as the parables, they are for teaching lessons in spiritual and moral growth. The Bible also includes the good news of salvation which can only be gotten through acceptance of God (Jehovah, that is) & Christ. No other religion (others being false) has the hope and salvation that is found with Jehovah and Christ. God & Christ exist regardless of your unbelief, but it is your free will to accept or not. But your choice will carry consequence. Also, you tell Lily to have some sense, but her faith IS actually her having sense. Atheism contains no hope and many atheists have even told me people have no purpose and life has no meaning; which means atheists value themselves WAY less than God Who made you values you! People have purpose and life has meaning. You tell Lily to do something ""worthwhile"". I believe her spreading hope is more worthwhile than you spewing your hate and profanity.

@CalLady79,"Micic00 The Word of God is God's Word which He gave to people of FAITH to set down in writing (2 Timothy 3:16 -""All Scripture is GOD-BREATHED and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,...""). When you are not of faith (like yourself), you cannot understand the truth of this, obviously. Have faith and you will begin to understand things that those of us who have faith understand. You should care what the Bible says because firstly it contains the knowledge of free salvation (which can only be gotten through accepting God & Christ). The seeking of salvation not only saves but it also changes a person. The Bible also is what will help you to CORRECTLY (and not accusingly) understand God, Christ and understand the righteous  reasonings of God. The Bible is also a spiritual and moral growth guide. Without God in one's life, one is good only according to their self-satisfying desires and limits. With God, one can truly work on improving for God's sake and; therefore, for the sake of true spiritual & moral growth. And guess what? God provides our conscious. It's just that believers use our conscious in connection with God Whom gave it. Nobody is perfect, but believers make effort to apply God's teachings to our lives. ",10년 전,1,

I'll bet you a 100 bucks you haven't even read your bible properly let alone many.

Oh yes let's overlook that and tell everyone that its the old testament. Some one realized how fucked up your excuse of a religion was and decided to rewrite the book. See that's how bad your religion is. Faith means to believe in things without evidence. Sorry but that is what fools do.

The majority of people of faith are people you do not even know personally (including me), so it is useless to think you know of our intellectual level. Do you hear how intellectually shallow your opinion of our intellect is, then? Atheists think you know it ALL, but logically you do not know it all. There are areas (and in this case, the area is God and faith) that others have come to know that you do not know. It is unintelligent & even lazy to dismiss God just because you haven't bothered getting to know Him in faith. It is also not very intelligent to only accept what you SEE. You limit yourself to a finite box without ever trying to understand that God is INfinite (He is eternal Spirit) and cannot be boxed in. He also provided evidence of Himself in things you can see (what I mean is all of creation).

@CalLady79,"jamn610 You show just how little you understand God and; therefore, His Word. First off, spreading hope is VERY worthwhile. I guess you don't like hope, but prefer the misery that humankind has shown to be prone to committing to self and each other. In God & Christ, there is hope. Yes, the Bible does promote moral growth. As far as the accusations you mentioned, they are all false: 1) People in the Bible are like people today: imperfect and sinners. The Bible mentioned that sleeping with your brother's wife is a SIN. It does not promote it. 2) When Egypt was punished, for example, they were punished for their atrocities AGAINST others (in this case, the Israelites). Pharaoh ordered their children to be slain...so they reaped what they sowed (and God FIRST gave Pharaoh a CHANCE to stop his error). I don't see you complaining about murderers being executed in today's penal systems. And as far as Psalm 137:9...that has to do with the psalmist speaking about revenge on enemies who first hurt his people; God did not even approve this and it mentions nothing of the sort. 3) Towns (like Sodom and Gomorrah for example) were reasonably destroyed because the people were NOT seeking to TURN FROM from their wicked ways EVEN WHEN God gave them a chance to (that shows God's mercy; when God gives us chances to turn from evil by doing His will). But you must think that continuing sin and evil is okay; you must not mind if evil cycles forever without ANY correction ever. Just like there are jails to help correct wrongdoing, for example, God has FAIR ways to correct us so that we learn and do and be BETTER. ONLY by accepting God & Christ can one be saved & also work at correct living. I don't think you can speak about morality when you are here cursing people out. That being said, I don't think you are qualified to throw around the word ""hypocrisy"".  Seems to me that I am using my intelligence to explain things you don't even understand. You could understand if you wanted to (that'll happen only if you stop being negative and seek Christ instead). There's no hypocrisy in anything I try to explain. You only see it that way because ""hypocrite"" is one of the key words atheists like to use to try to guilt-trip Christians or try to intimidate us so that we stop speaking. You are not the first atheist I have spoken to, so I have become aware of all the tricks. You use trickery and hate when instead you can use that energy to seek faith in God & Christ. When you do that, then things would be clear to you instead of COMPLETELY misunderstood. You don't understand now because of anger clouding any desire to have faith. By the way, comparing Barney to the importance & seriousness of God does not make you look any smarter than anyone else.  And it is not disrespecting other religions by saying that hope and salvation are only found in God & Christ. It is the just the truth. I notice this about many (not all, but many) people: people will give you high-fives if you tell them what they WANT to hear (even if it'll hurt them, but they like it because it is what they DESIRE to hear), but people hate you when you tell them the truth (even when it will help them). Christ said his followers would be hated as he was hated and he was right. But it is worth it when people are saved and come to realize God's love.  Through your anger and hatred-fueled profanity (which shows you in a negative light), you have shown an example of a couple of the reasons why people need God & Christ (with God, one has PEACE & can handle things better instead of being so angry). Nobody is forcing you to, but I hope you will accept FAITH. If you accept faith in God, you will also better know of God's LOVE for you. Right now, anger & constant misunderstanding blocks you.             ",10년 전,1,

And god ordered someone to sleep with his brother's wife. So much bs in the bible. They even had to rewrite the book as a new testament after they realized that it was full of crap. I could sit and read all the crap you just took to type but I got work, unlike you I dont sit back and thump bibles. And yes you are a hypocrite. Back when I believed in god, I had friends who were of different religions and they respected my religion, they never told me Christ was the path to salvation and bullshit. Even after I turned into an athiest they respected me as I respected them. They were truly good people and I'd spend time with them in a heartbeat. Now back to you, nope.

You are not worthy of the respect, when you act like a hypocrite. ",10년 전,0,
@CalLady79,"jamn610 I am well-educated in the Word of God that I follow (so no cherry-picking here; I accept all of it; but you go beyond cherry-picking because you do accept any of it and you do not apply ANY of it to your life). You, the atheist, do not know the Bible. Like all atheists, all you do is mention quotes and events in the Bible, but you are completely not capable of explaining what it means and the background on all of it. You don't understand God (since you choose not to try), so you don't understand the Bible either. An atheist apologized (VERY rare) to me once for misinterpreting the Bible. I explained something she got all wrong and she apologized. To address what you don't understand: 1) Sodom & Gomorrah was full of evil. God even said if there would be 10 good people, He would not destroy (Genesis 18:32). See how merciful God is? But there was not one good person, so He wanted to cleanse the place of evil that refused to CHANGE. You don't seem to like evil being purged. You seem to think unremorseful/unchanging evil should stick around in a cycle that never gets fixed. God gives people chances, but when those chances are wasted, punishment occurs. God is so merciful that there are many times people don't get punished to the extent they deserve. Like when God punished Egypt for their evil acts toward the Israelites; God could have completely wiped Egypt off the map, but He did not. He understandably punished Egypt harshly, but did not wipe them out. The Egyptians also saw that their false gods were nowhere around to help them. 3) 2 Kings 2:23-24 speaks about young men or boys who were punished for mocking a prophet of God. This is probably not about children. The translation refers more to young men and not kids. And they mocked Elisha whose mentor, Elijah, was caught up while alive to Heaven. So they were punished for mockery and for ganging up on Elisha. When they mocked a prophet of God, they were also mocking God. And it says: ""tore up forty-two lads OF their number"". The word ""OF"" in there means there were more boys, so not all of them were mauled. 4) The babies bashed on rocks (Psalm 137:9) I already mentioned in my last statement and that was the psalmist SPEAKING about revenge against peoples who had done evil toward his people. Nowhere here does it say God approved any revenge. It makes sense to not blame God for thoughts and actions God did not even approve. Stop blaming God for stuff. 5) This is more example that atheists don't understand the Bible correctly. (I edited this part to include exactly why Onan was punished.) JUDAH told Onan to be with his brother Er's wife (before that time Er had been punished by God for being evil, so it is not like Er was still alive when Onan took her, most likely, as his WIFE; it was not an affair). Genesis 38:10 shows God punishing Onan with death because what he did was WICKED (spilling his seed; WASTING life; wasting a child that could have come to be). You do not understand God (since you deny Him & are spiritually blind right now) nor do you understand God's Word. The Bible has not been re-written, but you would say that so you can give yourself reasons to not have faith in it & you say that because you don't even understand the Bible. People go the route of dismissing things JUST because they lack understanding. And you don't like to read what Christians explain to you, so then don't wonder why you continue to misunderstand. I bet you read books and comments on other subjects that are much longer and you have no problem with it, but as soon as someone speaks on God you have a problem reading. You are bent on misunderstanding God so that you can point a blame-finger, but God is not at fault for the errors and ills in this world.",10년 전,0,
@CalLady79,"jamn610 I explained all of the verses (the ones you referenced) above and you certainly did misunderstand all of them. Since you are not in spiritual bond with God, you will not understand the Bible, either.  And like I said before, I am not a ""hypocrite"" just because I tell you the truth that Christ is the path to salvation. I would be a poor Christian if I decided to appease you and tell you that there are other paths. There is no other path and I am not going to lie to you because that won't even help you to seek spiritual and moral CHANGE which can only be found with God (Jehovah, that is) and Christ. You say you used to be a believer. People stop having faith when they want things THEIR way instead of waiting for God's good and right timing. People quit faith when they do not maintain & nourish their faith. People quit faith when things go wrong and they do not work with God to get through it; they have no patience. You quitting faith is not God's fault. Your Christian friends might not have verbally told you that Christ is the path to salvation, but they KNEW it. Do you hate them for knowing and accepting that?? There is nothing pretentious in any of what I say. You are just angry because I am not telling you what you want to hear. If I tell you what you want, even though it would hurt you, I would not be a concerned human being. I am also a good person, but you don't see it that way because you have a cloud of anger over your head (it shows) & you do not want God's truth...you want to create your own truth. You speak of ""respect""....but then you bash and mock people for having faith. Where is the respect in that? In everything I said, never did I belittle you. And further on respect: I don't live to gain your respect because if I lived to gain your respect (which would mean telling you wrong things for your sake), I would be doing wrong against God and Christ. I won't do that for you or anyone. I hope you seek Christ & then you will have faith and come to understand that God loves you more than you realize now. Please stop bashing people for having faith. Faith-bashing is based on severe misunderstanding and lack of FAITH.",10년 전,0,
@jamn610,"CalLady79 isn't it ironic that you say atheists quote the bible? Very ironic. Wait let me get this straight, if there were 10 good people, he'd have left the town to stay? Oh shit, that's merciful as fuck. Get out of here, recheck your mental health please. And your god punished the dude for not impregnating her. And bashing the babies can be justified by revenge for the evil men? So revenge should also make your god evil. I don't like what Christians read to me because the first bullshit they come up with is that Jesus died for our sins. Get the he out. You know who else died for us? Martin Luther king, Gandhi, unsung heroes, etc and the difference between them and your Jesus is that they existed.

@CalLady79,"jamn610 You can't learn about God if you block and deny everything that a person (who knows God better since I don't run from Him) tells you. And atheists quoting the Bible is not ironic because you quote it, but you don't know any of the meaning or lessons BEHIND what you only quote.  Yeah, it was merciful of God to say he would spare an ENTIRE area of UNREMORSEFULY sinning people if even TEN righteous people were found. And before that, He would have spared it if more than 10 were found. You are a militant atheist (seeing how hell-bent you are against our faith), so of course you will misread everything, on purpose, for the sake of distortion due to being so against God. Also, you are an atheist, so you don't have that understanding of God. You don't due to being in a spiritual death right now; you haven't bonded with God spirtually, so then you won't have faith nor understanding. As far as what happened with Onan being punished (entire event is describe in Genesis 38:6-10), he was punished for spilling seed (semen), yes. I recalled that story but had to also recall the reason why Onan was put to death, so I read it, again and yes it was because of spilling seed that he was put to death). But the reason why Onan was put to death is not wrong. Tamar was Er's (Onan's brother) wife, but Er was evil and so God put him to death. JUDAH told Onan to be with Tamar. Onan then took Tamar as his wife (it is not like Onan was having an affair with his brother's wife; in those days, people took God's plan of marriage more seriously; people weren't sleeping around all over the place pretending to themselves that there would not be consequences). Because Onan WASTED LIFE (his seed; semen) that God creates, that is sinful and so he was punished. He wasted life and did not give Tamar a child. He reaped what he sowed. In order to understand God and the righteous reasoning behind why He does things, you must have faith. By the way, when people are sent to prison and executed, do you complain (even though mankind has no authority to take life)?  The bashing of babies on the rock (Psalm 137:9), again, was the PSALMIST speaking on revenge against people who did ill-will acts toward his people (acts that might have included killing babies). Why do you keep equating a person's personal vengeful feelings with God? I see you are intentionally trying to avoid learning because you have a vendetta (wrongfully so) against God & faith in Him. Vengeance belongs to God; we are not to take life which God created, so vengefulness is not a sin for God. He is in control and is also in control of punishment and blessings. When he punishes and blesses, He does so fairly and with REASON. And do you sit around blaming God for the evils that people CHOOSE to do?? And what happened to being mad with Satan? If you are ging to be mad at God (which is wrong), why not be mad at the OTHER side: Satan? You've said nothing against him and the evils he has brought into the world. I wonder...  Jesus died for our sins & brought SALVATION, whether you accept that or not. He did waht noone can do since he is perfect. He took on the sins of all people in order to atone for them. SO when someone comes into faith in Christ, they can receive the free gift of salvation. Afterwards, a person of faith must also work to live right by God; becoming a changed person in progress. MLK, Jr. and Ghandi are technically not ""unsung"" heros. There are many accolades and songs about him and there accolades & maybe some songs about Ghandi, too. Martin Luther King, Jr. (whom was also of faith, was one of the most well-known ministers ever & also loved God & Christ with everything he had) and Ghandi did great things for the people, but they did not do what Christ did. No one can do that & so Christ is well-deserving of high accolades and praise. Christ defeated sin. Christ existed and exists still (MLK, Jr., whom you admire, knew what you don't know...he had faith). Rational thinking includes choosing and I chose to have faith. Rational thinking includes the reality of God. You don't accept God because you want what you can readily SEE, but you don't get that God is so VAST that you can't just put Him in some limited box. Still, you can see Him in all of creation and in the lives of believers. But you keep ignoring this.  Again, I am not a hypocrite. And I know, as atheists do, you use that word to guilt-trip and also you say it over and over to upset me or to rile me up, but it is not working. That is what atheists do: you try to drill the negative. You do not respect religion because you come off as very bitter and angry with a negative attitude. I don't think you can accuse me of arrogance and pretentiousness when this whole time I have had a positive attitude while you go on being angry & mocking people. By the way, through all I have said I have not once FORCED you to convert and return to faith. That is a choice you have to make, but God is still good and still present whether you accept or not. He waits for you and loves you, but you don't even realize it because you keep fighting.  You quit faith because you don't understand God or you stopped trying to (that relates to you thinking it is silly). Of course you think it is silly because you have no faith and no understanding. That would be your error, not God's. God already gave you evidence of Himself in His Word, His works, in creation and in the lives of believers but you turn from it. So are you going to spend your life trying to mock & ridicule people for having faith in what you ignore or will you use that energy to try, again, to have faith? It is up to you. And unless I am repeating to you over and over again that you MUST convert (I am not), I am not ""prosyletizing"". So that accusation can drop. Lily Jane wasn't ""proselytizing"". All she did was share the good news ONE time (and was not DIRECTLY speaking to YOU) and you jumped under her post with a nasty comment about Jesus. So all someone has to do is mention God & faith ONE time and you go off on people, so it doesn't matter whether someone tries to convert you or not...you will still bash them for having faith. We can explain (which is what I have been doing) to you things about God's truth all day, but at the end of it all it is up to you. All I can ultimately do is hope and pray for you to receive God & Christ into your life.  With a temper such as yours, how can you help ""mankind advance""? Faith in God is based on sound mind and peace. That is what helps people. I hope you'll come to understand that. Will you still go on & on, here (after all, you invited yourself to post an abusive reply to Lily Jane for simply posting about God & faith) or will you just accept that people are going to choose fiaht whether you like it or not? Again, I hope that you decide to seek God & Christ, again, then you will have faith & understand. God loves you. Also, thanks for the apology.",10년 전,0,

If God would have just ""snapped His fingers to get them good"" (I asume you mean to get people to do good), then we would not make ANY EFFORT of our OWN to be good &, in that case, we would be weak-charactered and not LEARN anything. You accuse God of being mean (He is not), yet He does not even FORCE us to do anything. He won't force us to do good, we have to WANT to be & true good (good that is not self-satisfying) is found when one receives God & Christ into one's life. God tells us what we ought to do, but He will not force our choices (that is where free will comes in). God knew Adam & Eve would disobey Him, but what you do not get is that they CHOSE to go against what He TOLD THEM NOT TO DO. Blame them, do not blame God. If someone told you to not jump off a bridge, but you go and do it anyway, you need to blame yourself. You do not blame the person who TOLD YOU AHEAD OF TIME NOT to do it. God has all-power, but He does not FORCE (if He did that, I betcha you'd complain about that, TOO!). I defend God because He loves me and all humankind. I defend Him because He has good reason to do what He does (whether He is punishing or blessing). HE is God and He does what is best. I don't see you doing what is best. You sit here, hiding behind a keyboard, mocking & bashing faith (and you did; look up to your first comment to Lily, for example, you were very rude). That is cowardly and even inhumane. You do not know what is best with such a foul attitude and outlook. God knows what is best, you just want to live life as you PLEASE instead of living it in a way that is RIGHT and so you don't understand God's ways. His ways (which are righteous) are not like ours. And by the way, since you miss the WHOLE point of Christ, again, God does love and forgive us (but only if you have accepted Christ can you receive forgiveness, so if one does not seek to fix their sins or if one sits around denying and hating God all day-like you do-then do not expect forgiveness).  Aaahh, yes, Satan! You are unknowingly on his side (when you deny God, you are feeding into Satan's tactic to separate people from God). You also don't know Satan is messing with you because you don't know the signs. When one is of faith in God, we pay attention to God's warnings needed to help us avoid Satan. You are not in bond with God, so you don't even know when Satan is breathing down your neck. You unknowingly allow (because we have to allow it) Satan to guide you. And YOU said: ""I'm not blocking people from preaching their faith to me, I'm blocking people from giving me ______ (your profanity in that blankspace)."" That is not true because all  one need to do is simply mention God and you go off. Lily Anne was not even dircectly talking TO YOU & she was also very kind in her words and yet you (and a legion of other atheists) replied something severely nasty to her. So you DO have a problem with people even mentioning faith. SO you're ""I don't have a problem"" talk is not true. She simply posted a nice invite to Christ for people to read and you and other atheists went off on her. That is inhumane, even. Atheism already is not helpful, but then all your attitudes do is show even more why atheism is not good & is empty. Look how you go off on people for simply INVITING (not forcing) people to faith in God & Christ.... Christians, like everyone, are not perfect, but thanks to our relationship with God we do admit when wrong is wrong and we try to work on improving self spiritually and morally. Atheists try to convince themselves something is right EVEN when it is wrong! And the truth of God is not the profanity that you call it (do you know how to express yourself without profanity at all??). The truth of God is something you do not like, but just because you do not like it does not mean it stops being true and right. You just haven't accepted it. You are angry. Angry and annoyed and a bunch of other negative feelings based on your lack of understanding. You can blame yourself for not trying to understand. And you are ""annoyed"" because Lily posted an unrelated subject (faith) under this comedy video? So annoyed that you felt the need to spew a hateful reply to her EVEN though she was not rude in her post?? WOW. WOW. Shame. You just tried to JUSTIFY your abuse (the peace of Christ is not in your spirit)! So you certainly can't speak to anyone about what is ""good"" and ""right"". If you know anything about Youtube and stop making excuses, you will admit that people post unrelated sun\bjects under vids ALL the time (people have that freedom on a public forum). And lots of times those unrelated things are nasty, racist, perverted and bullying; yet I bet you NEVER  complain about OTHER unrelated subjects that are posted under videos. When people post about God, all of a sudden you have a problem.....  Rational thinking does include the reality of God. No matter how many childish ""hahahaha"" sentences you post, God exists. I have noticed when atheists are asked to explain where basic building blocks (to be general about things) come from, you can't even explain it. Instead they avoid answering by going silent or by going off on a berserk spree of profanity, insults at one's intellect, name-calling & a whole plethora of insubstantial, hate-based verbosity. I am used to it. You are not even just the 200th atheist I have come across online and offline. I don't have to resort to profanity, hatred or put-downs to your intellect just to explain things because being hateful & insulting is wrong and useless. The level of extreme ORDER and ARRANGEMENT found in all of creation did not happen from NOTHING and did not happen on its own. SOMETHING (in this case, SOMEONE) had to exist FIRST to PLAN and ORDER everything. DNA is a most complex design with each of its element ARRANGED. God is the DESIGNER/CREATOR. I can't force you to have faith in this. I can only tell you about it. But it remains the truth whether you want it to be or not. I also notice atheists like to use the same, negative words OVER and OVER for guilt-trip and instigation purposes. I see it all the time. You have said ""pretentious"", ""arrogance"" & ""prosyletize"" so many times that it is old now. You are not bothering me. Oh, and you have said the ""s"" word so many times it is a shame, but then you have the nerve to question the intellect of others when all you d half the time is use your brain to curse people. So, I think you have no place to call anyone arrogant. And no matter how much I would pray for you to change, I have not forced you to convert so your ""prosyletize"" accusation is null & void. And the only pretending I see is you wh pretends God does not exist so that you don't have to deal with CHANGE nor ACCOUNTABILITY. But He does exist. Like I said, He said so in His Word (none of which you understand right now due to having NO faith), He shows Himself in creation and in the lives of believers (lives you don't have; personal walks with God that you do not have).  You are being rude to bash anyone for posting about God & faith under any video. Lily Jane was doing as those of faith were told by Christ to do: spread the Word and this is just one way to do it. She wasn't being forceful. She was simply sharing. Lily was not speaking to any one particular person; it was a post that anyone was free to read. Plus she was being nice, actually. So yeah, you and the others ARE rude. How do you say yu are helping ""mankind to advance"" when you sit there justifying HATE?? You sit there being foul (again, hiding behind a computer, giving you false boldness) and then you try to justify being abusive toward someone who had nothing but good news and kind words to say?? You are showing poor character; there's no love in anything you did. You do not have any peace in you, but with God and Christ, you'd start to use peace. Then you bash someone (who was explaining God & Christ and who was not forcing conversion on you), but then expect nobody to defend her?? WOW. Nobody is scared of you, though. Especially when you are making sure you do your abuse safe bejind a computer. Who can be scared of someone who hides & who speaks hate and abuse? People post unrelated stuff all the time under videos (a lot of those things foul & abusive), but I bet you never complain about those posts. As soon as someone brings up God, you have a problem. Another person replied here complaining about what Lily Jane posted and I told her the same thing I just told you (that she probably has NO problem when unrelated posts of OTHER subjects are posted, but ALL of a sudden she had a problem when the unrelated subject is about faith) and she never replied back to me. Maybe she saw I had a point.  As far as the starving kids in Africa (and anywhere for that matter); that is one of the ""go-to"" subjects atheists use to guilt-trip the faithful about God. No, you do not understand God (and being that you are an atheist avoiding God, that should be obvious). God provided MORE than enough resources on earth for generation upon generation. That being said, you can blame greedy government, badly-run government and corrupt corporations for poverty. PEOPLE HURT EACH OTHER. Stop t\blaming God. It is wrong and old. And many of the starving people you speak of have faith in God (gonna knock them for this, too??) and they have faith that He will protect them and bring them out of their struggles when no one else cares to help them. God has brought many people out of struggles. It takes faith in Him and patience to hold on. I have seen what GOd does for struggling people who become successes. We are so NOT in control as vulnerable human beings, that we need a hand and that Hand is God's.  I don't see you doing anything to help ""mankind advance"". Is typing profanities, childish insults and hate on a keyboard helping mankind to advance?? You sit there complaining about the hatred in society, but then you JUSTIFY your hatred! Huh?? As for me, when I am not on this keyboard, I like to spread the Word and also do other activities to help people. When I am on this keyboard, I partly use it to help spread God's Word and I can also use this keyboard to say that despite all the hatred you have shown, I do not even hate you. I hope you seek Christ and learn the faith and peace that you do not have in you at the moment.  Anyhow, hope you are done. I got on here to stand up for God & to defend a person (Lily Jane) who simply KINDLY invited people to Christ.  I believe in God & Christ Whom are real. It is just up to you to accept it.  ",10년 전,0,
@jamn610,"CalLady79 first of all like I said, cut down your long comment, I'm not jobless like you to sit down and read all the bullshit you type. Oh now its I who is forcing people to now to have faith. Hahahahahaha You know faith is like a penis, good to have one. Just don't whip it out in public and wave it across everyone's faces. That's why Jane did, and you defend her. Typical ignorant Christian. You wish to teach me? About what? The stories written in the bible? Oh please verify its authenticity first, its just as authentic as the spiderman comic next to me. I could go about telling how badly your Adam and eve logic is flawed. Heck how badly the bible is flawed, with the poor plot. But then again you'd run all your bs over again and tell me that I refuse to understand. Yeah sure. Oh please, you are SUBTLY proselytizing. Denying it won't help.  Yeah the Satan trump card, lol explain why the god concept and bible is stupid, and automatically we become Satan's minions. Like i said before faith is like a dick.... No atheists don't try to convince themselves that something is right. If you had at least half a brain, and if you have had a proper education in science and not Scientology, then even a 5th grader will see why your religion is based on utter illogical horsecrap. Blahblahblah wow. Wow. Shame. Blahblahblah. Just as much as she has the freedom to post anything, I have the freedom too. Just because she posted something religious, doesn't mean that it is entitled to respect nor is it immune to criticism and ridicule.  If we really knew where basic building blocks came from, we'd have a jump in technology. So tell me lady, where did the building blocks come from? Oh yeah it was god. Isn't that your claim? Your proof is? How do magnets work? Can you tell me how the stars are formed? How babies are made? What is DNA? Oh wait scientific questions appall you. I honestly dont give 2 fucks if I'm the 200th athiest you've come across. I mean congratulations, no one gives a flying fuck. Blahblahblah profanity blahblah Jane blah blah. You just repeated everything you just said. Good job. Oh yeah lol justifying the starving people with the problems of the government, since you realized that your god didn't do jackshit to help them over the last century.  I help people in old age homes on a monthly basis. I provide free tuition to my neighboring kids who can't afford extra education. I always do my best to donate to the blind charity. My college team and I are trying to work on designing the cheapest computer that could be built, so that anyone could afford it. I could go on. And what do you do? Oh yeah let me guess, proselytize, thump bibles, pray for miracles, tell people that god loves them, indoctrinate kids, spread bs and scientific illiteracy, what more and what not. Let me just stop here, not because I want to fuck off, its because its useless talking to you. I remember someone saying, arguing with a theist is like playing chess with a pigeon, no matter how good you are a using your logic or plating chess, the pigeon will still mess up the board, shit on it and strut triumphantly. ﻿",10년 전,0,
@CalLady79,"jamn610 You haven't cut down your comments, so why ask me to? You have read books, I am sure, longer than what I typed but since this has to do with telling truths about God, you all of a sudden are incapable of reading. Your mindgames and selectiveness. You can't learn that way. Anyway....  I actually typed this while on break at my job. So thanks for doing as atheists like to do, which is pretend you know EVERYTHING. Also, thanks for not asking if I have a job or not. Anyway....  I see that you are still not capable of communicating without cursing people. Does that add weight to your words? Nope. Not really. It adds false weight. What you say has no validity (since you do not know God in your life), so you try to force your words to have weight by cursing at people. Sad. All that does is further prove you are angry, but God is not to blame for your anger. Your misunderstanding is to blame.  I said you are trying to force people to not have faith; to even stop talking about it, but you don't control anyone, so that will always be a fail.  Now penis references. You really have a poor way of speaking. Anyway, I don't think you can get mad at people for ""waving"" around faith when you are waving around your hatred and atheism. And like I have been saying, people can tell you about God & Christ and about the way to salvation, but no one is FORCING you here. Jane did not force you because she was NOT EVEN TALKING TO YOU DIRECTLY. I bet if someone posted about ANYTHING ELSE, you would've been just fine with it. So you can quit those false accusations. She spoke with LOVE. You chose to respond with HATE. You defended your nasty comment to her, so don't even talk to me about ignorance. You have a lot of hate in you toward those who choose faith and so that is why you come at us like you do. Hatred blinds and it blocks you from understanding God correctly.  If someone is not good at math, then it makes sense that someone who knows math better to explain it. You do not have a spiritual bond with God, so you don't know anything correct about Him. You gave up trying to understand (you said you were of faith once) & that is your fault, not God's. So, since you do not understand God, it makes sense that those of us who have faith in Him can help one to understand. The Bible is not flawed. You just pick the easy and lazy road to dismiss things due to not even getting what is going on and not getting why. It's like this is how you think: ""I don't get it & I don't spend time to try getting it like other people have! Forget it! Since I personally do not understand, t's flawed! Now time to go and smash on people for having faith! YAY!!"" Seriously. That is how you act.  There you go with that ""proselytize"" word, again. It is rather used up by now. And has no validity since I did not even force you once. I say that the truth is whether you accept or not, God is truth, but I never forced you to convert. Did I drag you to church and threaten to beat you? Nope. Did I yell at you: ""Convert!""? Nope. Did I say: ""You BETTER change NOW!""? Nope. I said I hope and pray you will seek Christ, but it is up to you. Even God does not want us to force because force is not an act of love. I have no time to hate you like you hate me.  Satan rebelled against God (God made him to be good) and he wants to drag people down with him...right now, he is using you very much. You just don't see it. I see you pounce on God (Whom is righteous and created you, but you created your own hatred) very easily, but you always give ole Satan a break. Hmmm. Satan hates you. Just letting you know. Atheists are being used by Satan. He is wrongfuly against God and he wants people to be, too. That is where sin and also unbelief comes in. Atheists DO try to convince themselves that something is right even when it is wrong (or did you ""forget"" that you justified your perverse words toward Lily Jane EVEN THOUGH she was not forcing anything and EVEN THOUGH she was very nice, actually). Ummm...I don't follow Scientology. So....what? Scientology is also false. It also has nothing to do with God, Christ and salvation for humankind. There are 5th graders who have the backbone to step out of their limitations and accept faith in God. And here is another thing about Lily Jane (since you keep mentioning her): no matter if anybody reading liked it or not, what she shared she shared with kindness. All you and others did was meet that with HATE. You unequally reciprocated love with HATE!  I should ask you how magnets work, how babies are made and what is DNA and what you will do is do what I have seen 1,000s of atheists do: explain the particle or organic origins, but be unable to explain the origins of the particles, organisms, etc. Those things, which also have an ORDER and DESIGN came from God, The Designer. You are so against your Creator (due to not understanding Him at all & due to not liking the thought of being accountable), that you deny everything about God. Hmmm. And about starving people.....what have YOU Done to help the world's starving people? Have you brought anyone from the brink of death? Have you changed MULTIPLE lives throughout time? Or have you just been sitting around complaining and calling names? Even if you give donations, which is nice, you can't save people from dying and you can't bring someone from poverty to prosperity. Only God can do that and many people have testimonies of that. So tell me...would you, with that faith-hatred of yours, bash formerly poor people who chose to have faith in God and credit Him with their survival? Because guess what? You do not have THEIR walk with God and the nerve of you to even pretend you can take away (using your hate) from them what they KNOW.  I am not sure to believe what you say about how you help the community, but if you do those things, that is nice. But if you wer in bond with God, the good you can do would be on another level. He could really work through the energy you have to do the kind of good (that you haven't realized) within His will and plans. And guess what? God provides the long lives of the elderly, He provides the money that people use in charitites and donations. He provides all that we use in positive acts. You just do not credit the Provider (God, that is). And thanks for asking me what I do and THEN answering for me. I notice atheists do that...you answer for us. It is like you are afraid that our answer will make sense or that our answers will get you thinking. Or maybe your tactic of answering for me is used to test me & trip me up, but that does not work on believers if the believer is strong and I am strong. I have helped in many ways, but here I would only name a few: I have donated to charities, I have initiated and run donation drives for the needy, I have worked as a volunteer at a ministry involving mothers with no home (they lived at the Christian ministry, which also helped them by giving them a place to stay & helping them find jobs), I have walked a few miles on foot raising money for people after the big tsunami in Southeast Asia hit one year, I have tutored people and I plan on running an arts-based charity for kids in unfortunate areas. So before you geefuly pounce on people, try asking them a little about their life or involvements, first. Also, I credit God for all that He provides in all of those endeavors (I don't provide any of it, I use it and I am the vessel God uses to do these things since I am in bond with Him; because of faith in God, I am able to do good in ways that only those of faith can see). I credit God for giving me the energy to do good things for His sake and the sake of those He created. Matthew 5:16 - ""In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.""   And yes, I do continue to pray for miracles (I have seen the results time and again which have happened in God's good timing, not my timing), speak on the Bible & I do tell people that God loves them (I can't spread the hatred you seem to go about doing). I do not (to use this worn out word of yours) proselytize and I do not indoctrinate; both of those words have to do with force and I don't force. We believers can tell you about God up and down & all day, but it is up to you to decide you want to open up and accept His truth. If you did, you'd be changed and you'd have faith. Faith would also bring understanding and a calmer way of dealing with life (instead of being bitter). I see you drilling people with your hatred, though. You seem to admire Martin Luther King, Jr. (you mentioned him a while back in one of your replies), but he also, of course, had high faith in God. You don't know his walk with God. He knew his own walk with God and the love he had for God motivated his work.  Despite all of your profanity and negativity, God gives me the love I have in me to still say that God loves you. He hates your sins (and all of our sins), but He loves you. You don't wake on your own. His mercy wakes you up to give you a chance to CHANGE (2 Peter 3:9 ""The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.""). Judgment could have come already if God wanted it to, but He gives people chances to repent in Christ & to also live lives according to what is right and good (not according to what we want; which is flawed & hurts us). If you decide on faith, you can live a life of working away from sin (through forgiveness & through living in God's way).   I see you say you are stopping (of course you decide to end things with profanity while I choose love; your hate is helping no one and it does not help you). ",10년 전,1,
@CalLady79,"jamn610 There goes the usual, atheist ""insult believers' minds"" game. I am used to it, so it does not bother me. I don't depend on you to determine my intelligence. It sure isn't too bright to assume that people of faith don't have intelligence due to us haing faith. There are people who are more intelligent than you who have faith. I know it might tick you off for me to say it (because apparently, EVERYTHING makes you mad), but atheists aren't the only ones with active brains.... And I made a statement about you complaining about my lengthy replies because it made no sense for you to complain about it when you aren't exactly writing 2-line replies yourself. Now, use your brain and think about that.  Anyway, you have a hardcore hatred. It shows in your poor approach to people (but your negativity is heightened because you cower behind a screen). Your hatred is all due to Satan (yep) and yourself. That is who to blame. You said you ""can't waste time"" with me...........yet you are STILL commenting. Methinks God and people who know God better than you (you obviously have no understanding of Him since you avoid Him) piques your interest. Hm. And I get what your ""penis"" reference was about (just because I didn't agree with it or address it, does not mean I don't get it). You have foul, nasty attitude. You speak of intelligence, yet you can't manage to speak to someone without having a disgusting way of doing it. But guess what? YOU are the one who looks bad. Thanks for showing everyone how nasty you are. Sad. You ""helping mankind"" (as you have claimed)?? Please. Atheist ""love"" is limited & it hits a dead-end in you somewhere. That is not helpful. You sit there COMPLAINING about the badness in the world while you are APART of it! You JUSTIFY your nasty reply to Lily's message of love & while you justify your bad attitude in general. If you are like this online, I bet you are even more negative in person. Dude, I am not scared of you, so you can knock off the fake, tough-guy (or girl?) tone. And I still don't hate ya. I have no time to sink to your level of hatred. Hate is useless, a waste of time and for the weak.  Proselytize means to try to convert someone. I am not forcing you, so you can stop using that dry word over & over (atheists like to drill people; it's not working). Typical atheist. Always accusing us of forcing you to receive Christ WHILE the atheist forces their hate. Hm. If you had Christ in your life, you'd be CHANGED and a lot less bitter. But yet, I cannot force you. I have said I can't force you a billion times, so your accusations of force fall flat.  Proof of Satan is showing even IN you. Look how angry and negative you are. Satan is loving it and you keep allowing it. Anytime we do wrong, that is us allowing Satan to use us & the atheist allows it (unknowingly) EVERYDAY. But since you don't accept God, you can't heed God's warnings about Satan and you can't see the signs. Guess what about science? IT CAN'T EXPLAIN EVERYTHING. You think because you take some science classes, read some science books and watch some science channels, that you know EVERYTHING EVER KNOWN TO MANKIND. Give me a break. There are hardcore, professional scientists with hard-earned degrees who humbled themselves enough to admit they don't know everything! God knows all, though, but unless you accept God, you can't understand this.  So, you admit you have done ""nothing"" (your word) to help starving people. First off, God provided more than enough resources for mankind to eat. So, God's not to blame for starvation. God is always helping the starving (many of them have faith in Him)! When people survive times of starvation, that is God doing His work right there. If you are as intelligent as you believe you are, it is common sense that people cannot control life nor death. No matter how much health food we eat and doctors' visits, we still can die anytime. People can't control it. So when someone survives things and also survive things we think they should not have, that is GOD at work. And when people die, it is thanks to our imperfection (we were made perfect, but Satan brought sin and now we suffer thanks to Satan). You did not directly say that you ""admire"" Martin Luther King, Jr., but you did MENTION him in one of your comments as someone who did great things (and he did). I guess you have selective memory. You mentioning him as having done great things MEANS you must admire him. Ummm. And MLK Jr. loved God & Christ. His work was motivated by God's love & goodness.  ANYWay...you KEEP saying over & over you were ""stopping"" (you said it in your last reply, too), so stop. Besides, YOU INVITED yourself here at random for NO reason but to be nasty, so stop.",10년 전,0,

Next, it's not ""idiotic"" to share the gospel knowing that the responses won't be good. As a Christian, you came into the faith most likely knowing persecution would arise, but also knowing God protects & realizing that persecution only serves to make us stronger for God. Sharing God's Word is something that can help & save people who want to be helped & saved, so it is not ""idiotic"". Think about it like this...just like you took the chance to admit you are a Christian here (even with knowing how nasty people are toward Christians on the internet), Lily took a chance to share the gospel.

He could not care less how much you suffer in this life.  God-given brains are where scientific breakthroughs come from, but there are still so many illnesses and disease that modern science still knows nothing about, and no cures are on the horizon for many; and yet people have tumors and cancers that disappear with no scientific explanation and still others recover from illness that modern day doctors told them would kill them and that science had no answer/cure for.",10년 전,0,

If you are looking for memes. I can tell you I don't have any. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my meme go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you.

@TheRizGuy,"I'm not an expert or anything, but I think the number of mean tweets tweeted about celebrities have escalated since the ""Celebrities Read Mean Tweets"" segments started, it won't only be by people who like being mean for the sake of it, but those who want their names or usernames or whatever they tweeted to be seen on tv or internet.  Even though sometimes its funny as hell, some celebrity reactions are painful to watch and certainly painful for the person the tweet has been directed towards.  Gwyneth Paltrow's reaction makes me sad, Chloe Grace Moretz's is kinda hot and scary, Chris Pratt's is adorable, Lisa Kudrow's reaction is hilarious, so I'm not sure if I want to see ""Celebrities Read Mean Tweets"" again, but mean tweets will be tweeted, the videos will be made, and I'll end up watching them.",10년 전,0,

@CalLady79,"Freddie Stranger True. Celebrities are idols (like money and material things for example) that some look up to rather than look up to God & Christ (Turning to faith is what actually really does change lives). God wants none to perish, so He gives people time (just by Him waking people up each day) to receive Christ & be saved; time to repent. He wants none to perish (2 Peter 3:9). God is very merciful to give humankind time to change. For the faithful, each day is a process toward honoring God better (and when we honor God, we also improve ourselves).I pray that more people will receive Christ and be changed. I hope nobody will be rude just because you posted about God under this video. People post comments about whatever they want on Youtube (whether the subject is related to the video or not) & nobody says anything, so when someone posts about faith in God, people should not be rude.",10년 전,1,

God loves you more than you love yourself. Then you said all that temper tantrum, unintelligent stuff behind a screen, so you're also a coward. You are that Angry Atheist Keyboard Commando. You only hurt yourself, but inviting the love of God & Christ into your life would change that. Having faith in God & Christ does mean I take responsibility for my actions because faith causes one to admit being a sinner & causes one to make efforts to improve. You are not of faith & it shows. You spew hatred and filth & THEN try to convince yourself it was the right thing to do when it was not right. YOU don't take responsibility for your actions. Grow up.",10년 전,1,

Maybe, but then again there wasn't really a ton of parental supervision from what I can gather and her intentions were exploratory rather than malevolent.  http://www.salon.com/2014/11/04/child_therapists_stop_freaking_out_about_lena_dunham/",10년 전,3,

That being said, she is clearly too old to actually play the character in a movie.   It's also worth noting that Ellen Page only ever mentioned The Last of Us, because people kept bugging her about in on Reddit, saying shit like, ""Whoa they ripped you off!""  She never threatened to sue and probably would have never even heard of the game if people didn't bother her about it first.  She's not a gamer.",10년 전,4,
