Russian cargo ship owner trying to default his creditors and on the side , trying to make undeclared income via in middle of the set course ,..... he ordered the captain of the ship to make a quick unplanned stop to carry some heavy construction machinery to be picked up from Beirut and dropped off to Jordon !  The old ship marooned on the port and had taken water and needed expensive repairs and abandoned by the owner and Beirut port officials in full red tape mannerism,..... ordered the containers of the ship to be be seized ! 3.

If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them.  30 Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back.  31 Do to others as you would have them do to you.  32 “If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you?

Even sinners do that. 34 And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full.  35 But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back.

Greedy port officials in the year 2013 , when they seized the Russian cargo ship over just a little amount of fine and did not give any due regards towards the request of the Captain of the ship  that it was carrying the same explosive chemicals headed for Mozambique ! 2. Russian cargo ship owner trying to default his creditors and on the side , trying to make undeclared income via in middle of the set course ,..... he ordered the captain of the ship to make a quick unplanned stop to carry some heavy construction machinery to be picked up from Beirut and dropped off to Jordon ! The old ship marooned on the port and taken water and needed expensive repairs and abandoned by the owner and Beirut port officials in full red tape mannerism,..... ordered the containers of the ship to be be seized ! 3. Since 2014,...... every field port official/inspectors and chief is guilty of neglecting the fact that in their yard , there is a massive hold out of Ammonium Nitrate and things can go south very quickly if not auctioned off in a proper safe manner !",5년 전,3,

@xyz-kz6rx," @MLB291  Radiation levels suddenly spiked more than TEN TIMES HIGHER in areas of the Mediterranean Sea yesterday, after an enormous blast leveled half of Beirut, Lebanon.  Initial intelligence analysis indicated the explosion in Beirut was a failed-to-maintain-critical-mass NUCLEAR BLAST.  That means the blast started as a nuclear chain reaction, but the chain reaction FAILED partway through the event and nowhere near all of the radioactive core was used-up in the explosion.  That failure of the chain reaction would significantly lessen the blast itself, but would leave lots of radiation, which we are now seeing at places hundreds of miles away . . .",5년 전,0,

Yes, it is a bomb attack, but no terrorist group has the capability to carry out such a powerful attack and does not have that weapon. But Israel and America must be behind it. Because a few days ago, Lebanon imposed sanctions on the US ambassador, then the US-Israel embargo on Lebanon was accompanied by a joint threat from Israel and the US. Now they are behind the series of explosions in the Lebanese capital. Because accidents can never be a series of explosions simultaneously in different places.

It was 10:30 pm when my mom called so we talked for about 2 minutes and then i heard a loud bang. The call just ended after that loud bang so i was worried for my mom. I tried to call her for 30 min straight then she picked up and said ""well talk tomorrow bby"". Then i went to my aunt's house for brunch and told what happened yesterday. She also said that if i wouldn't have called her my mom would've died/injured because the house that my mom lives in is close where the bomb exploded. (How you might ask? Well she went somewhere that has phones so that she could call me.)  Ps: sorry for my bad english",5년 전,0,

We need to step off of our high horses and humble ourselves, acknowledge that we need God.

@matthewmarsicano9854,Tjeerd Eijsink The building at the epicenter of the explosion was a port warehouse not a military run weapons storage facility. As of right now though the likely hood that this was an attack is extremely low. Warehouses storing various chemicals are prone to explode and it just so happens that the building that exploded in Beirut was not meant to be handling such dangerous products. At this moment I write the explosion off as a failure of the governments that was caused by people with little knowledge of chemicals having the job to decide where it is cheapest to store chemicals.,5년 전,2,

@pjukas,"It was ammonium nitrate that was not stored properly, several warnings had been voiced by inspectors to the authorities but they did not fix the problem in time. And now this sad thing happened. Ammonium nitrate is used as fertilizers and can explode if it is exposed to extreme heat and is stored in the wrong way.",5년 전,0,
@yapandasoftware," @pjukas  Ammonium Nitrate must have a catalyst to explode. It must also be compressed. (No room for expansion). I'm from OKC.. I was in the Murray bombing blast when it occurred. I use to work in Geo seismic doing shot hole and I've packed more explosives than most people.  This explosion was not Ammonium Nitrate in my opinion. The compression was more like hydrogen expansion. The plumb was from dirt so I can assure you the blast came from underground blasting upwards as i view from the videos I've seen. I say this because it blew a ""Smoke Ring"" caused from the narrowing of the blast upwards. Now if the blast went out in all directions, it wouldn't have made a smoke ring. That smoke ring is like when you shape your lips like an ""O"" and puff the smoke out of the opening of your mouth. If you study blasts from a tube, they do this same effect.

@matthewmarsicano9854,Both explosions look very similar to me. It appears in China though there was a series of explosions which suggests the volatile chemicals were not contained in one holding space like in Lebanon. This is also why in the Lebanon explosion you can see a wave of ash and smoke being push out from the shear contained pressure from the epicenter of the explosion. There was also three times the amount of ammonium nitrate stored in Lebanon compared to the Tianjin explosion which explains why much more destruction was caused throughout the entire city.,5년 전,0,
@lizily3317," @matthewmarsicano9854  yeah you're right, like I said, I'm not an expert, I have very little basic chemistry background, I think what seemed to make a difference between the two explosion for me was the mushroom cloud, and I didn't take into account other factors that played a role in the explosion, but thanks for clearing that up",5년 전,0,

That is going to overflow their hospitals' ICUs and make handling the coronavirus much more difficult. 4. The first explosion was set off by fireworks. The much more massive second explosion is the 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate that was nearby, that wasn't secured. It had been there for 6 years, and the people who were meant to secure it never did.

@moalmo8370," @imkuelllgremlin  It's hard to assume that all things happend unintentionally; especially given that no one clarified what is exactly happenning. Corona pandemic, as an instance, is known to be intentionally released to the world. I'm not accusing China or any other country, but just thinking logically through it, and recalling all the events, It's trully hard to not believe so.   Anyways, 2700 pounds of Ammonium Nitrite. Is it also a chance to be exactly there and to prepare all the conditions and the scene to be as precise as we've seen? The weird thing is, we have all seen the Ammonium explosion happened in China before, and this is an exception; it doesn't really look like anything similar to the one happened in China; the magnitute and the range is horrible. Do you still believe it is a chance sent by the God himself to sentence us? Even if we believed in the credibility of that, still, God won't punish us with no reason. So in either ways, humanity is the monster here, the universe is just trying to live in its own way and we are preventing it.",5년 전,0,

@ilyleforever3366,"Get right with GOD while you are still alive - here’s a start - ❤️ GOSPEL - REPENT of your sins and Believe on THE LORD JESUS CHRIST (Yeshua the Only Son of God - the God of Israel and creator of all creation), the only begotten Son of God and HE will save you from your sins upon repentance.  We are saved by GODS GRACE through FAITH in Jesus Christ. Good works cannot save you. It is a free gift from GOD. The LORD JESUS CHRIST died on the cross -  HIS Blood was shed to make atonement for our sins to redeem us, to save us from condemnation. He rose from the dead 3 days later and now sits at the right hand of GOD the FATHER.  Romans 10:9 says - That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. HE did this to pay for YOUR sins IF you believe in Him.  Read the GODS Word - the Bible to get to know HIM and to walk in HIS ways, following HIM. If you believe in Him, He will send His Holy Spirit to dwell within you, to guide you, instruct you, teach you HIS Word. Repent of your sins, ask forgiveness. Be baptized in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. All have sinned and fall short of the Glory of God. We ALL need a Savior the ONLY true Savior is Jesus Christ who died for YOUR  sins IF you put your faith in Him. We will all stand before Gods judgement seat with The Lord Jesus Christ - God Himself - judging us. You either have HIM covering your sins or else YOU must pay for them yourselves and will be unable and therefore condemned by the very one who gave HIS LIFE to save whoever will believe upon Him. We all stand guilty and condemned without HIM, no matter how good of a person we think we are. But God the Father so loved the world that He sent His only Begotten Son to die for our sins to all who will believe in Him, we shall never perish but have everlasting eternal life. The Lord Jesus Christ is returning soon as judge. If you die tonight, whatever state you die in is your eternal destination. There are NO second chances NO - purgatory as taught by the Catholics. You either belong to Jesus Christ when you die or you don't. Please don't delay in seeking His salvation, you are not promised tomorrow! ❤️",5년 전,7,

And considering how unstable Mankind is I came to the conclusion that humans are gonna be the cause (or at least part of it) of the demise of the earth. It may not happen for a very long time but with the power we have there is no doubt that we will have some part of the complete destruction of the planet.

@Authorkaylarose,Bruce Robertson You’re ignorant. If you look at the “perspective” of how long corona has been around it’s been half a year meaning as you say 700k AND COUNTING has died in that short amount time. It’s the time span that’s making the difference.,5년 전,4,

@biblebot8473,"Bricks Without Straw  1Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘Let my people go, so that they may hold a festival to me in the wilderness.’ ”  2Pharaoh said, “Who is the Lord, that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know the Lord and I will not let Israel go.”  3Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God, or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword.”  4But the king of Egypt said, “Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor? Get back to your work!” 5Then Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working.”  6That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and overseers in charge of the people: 7“You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks; let them go and gather their own straw. 8But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don’t reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’ 9Make the work harder for the people so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies.”  10Then the slave drivers and the overseers went out and said to the people, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I will not give you any more straw. 11Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all.’ ” 12So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw. 13The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, “Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw.” 14And Pharaoh’s slave drivers beat the Israelite overseers they had appointed, demanding, “Why haven’t you met your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?”  15Then the Israelite overseers went and appealed to Pharaoh: “Why have you treated your servants this way? 16Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told, ‘Make bricks!’ Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people.”  17Pharaoh said, “Lazy, that’s what you are—lazy! That is why you keep saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.’ 18Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks.”  19The Israelite overseers realized they were in trouble when they were told, “You are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day.” 20When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them, 21and they said, “May the Lord look on you and judge you! You have made us obnoxious to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.”  God Promises Deliverance  22Moses returned to the Lord and said, “Why, Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Is this why you sent me? 23Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people, and you have not rescued your people at all.”",5년 전,0,

@taureanwooley,"I remember when I was a little kid there were several people who were brought there because there was a new technology that was going to come out and they may have needed or may have not needed it, but the real problem still exists in Beruit. Then they drugged everyone that was there and showed them how God could still exist and it would be a human problem and not a God problem because there would be nothing left. There were numerous casualties but they would usually warn people, but it wasn't the government warning people it was the people warning people and they didn't know if it was a joke or not.  This one appears to be a similar thing, although the guy who took us there said that if the cars are flipped over in a specific area where a car accident was perceived to have happened then they would know that they didn't flip over the cars when they were little kids, especially if they touched the cars. Plus a large amount of other little tidbits left inside of it, dealing with some very odd things occurring with life that no one could perceive outside of themselves because they didn't know how else to explain it correctly.  Said that it helps with a possible new language for proper discussions outside of France, since all nations have issues not just France.",5년 전,0,

But in a lot of the other videos, they zoom in and it shows lights going off within the smoke, and I believe it was a firework explosion. Fireworks use gunpowder just like bombs do, but they are just toned down. With enough fireworks though, that gunpowder becomes a lot more than you would think and could easily cause this explosion. The reason there are no bright lights during the explosion is because fireworks have a certain amount of gunpowder and other chemicals in each rocket, but when there are thousands of them, and they all explode, 99% of the chemicals that create the fun lights are incinerated away, that's why at the beginning of the video, before the full explosion, you can see flashing lights going off from the fireworks before they are incinerated.",5년 전,0,

The number of attacks this country has suffered in the last decade is utterly absurd.

@Blossom_S666,"For those wondering, lemme clear some things up, the country is used to explosions that is true and sad Iknow, but they've already had to rebuild their port. Since the end of the Lebanese Civil War in 1990, the port has gone through a major updating and expansion program with the rehabilitation of existing port facilities, the construction of new administration buildings, and the construction of a new container terminal. During these expanding phases, they'd have explosions and things that don't work out anyway, so the port is pretty well known for being a destructive zone. Now then, the port has been said to have a warehouse with Ammonium Nitrate, a chemical. The smoke can only be that colour due to the chemicals inside it. The chemical was stored within a warehouse which is odd because statements from the Interior Minister in Beirut say that the chemical was not allowed anyway so they don't know why it was there, don't let false news of ""fireworks"" persuade you, those sparks were electric due to it being at a warehouse and a chemical which started the fire as if fireworks being kept in a facility would go up like that, blue sparks that look like lightning? make the correlation yourself, it's electric. So. that's about all the info I have from my research, live updates are being provided too so you never know I might be proven wrong, either way, #PrayForBeirut",5년 전,0,

Hopefully it was just a freak accident, but we all know, blame will be cast one way or the other I'm sure, we will just see how the accused will respond to said accusations. I did just hear that Israel is offering aid to them which was nice to hear, but again we don't really know anything going on behind the scenes...

@lucassmith1886," @pauloli4341  I mean, I technically think you're correct in that the ""world war three"" has started quite a while ago with 9/11 as the catalyst. And yes we have seen varying levels of intensity as well, however mostly engaging in proxy wars, and smaller drawn out engagements instead of all out war, which is something sadly I believe we will continue to see for a very long time as no party is willing to bend or make any sacrifices for actual deescalation negotiations. Every time one group builds a base somewhere, or does something to secure their ""defenses"" more, then the other groups inevitably do the same, which in turn makes the initial group take another step, in a perpetual state of stepping just on the line, not crossing it, but getting as close as possible without pulling the trigger.",5년 전,0,

If this was caused by fireworks,  the explosion would have sounded like many firecrackers going off with rapid and visible sparks from individual devices. From the video included in Phillip DeFranco's video on this, it did not sound like that could have been the most probable cause. An explosion that big was probably due to large, LARGE amounts of explosives...  If this was not terrorism, it could have been state run, but who knows yet.. this is just my speculation.",5년 전,0,

@JustChillin227," @awakenthedawn-seaglasswors6739  The gospel by which we're saved. We're under Paul's ministry today. Therefore we're not under the law of the old testament. 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 (KJV)1 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures. And that takes us back to John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that WHOSOEVER believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Ephesians 2:8-9 (KJV) 8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast. So it's only by GRACE that we are saved not by works. Jesus did all the work and gave us GRACE (unmerited favor) as long as we have FAITH (believe) in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ for SALVATION (trust in his blood). That's the gospel. Jesus said, Ye must be born again to enter into the kingdom.(accept Jesus as your SAVIOR)",5년 전,0,

@Kellynganga," @cowchow4u  when i said turn from sin i did not mean you will never sin again, neither did i mean that turning from sin is what saves you. Salvation is already paid for through the suffering, death and resurrection of JESUS. However after this we are called to repent(Matthew 4;17, Acts 2:38), to be holy as our HE who called us is holy(1 Peter 1;15), not to sin wilfully after receiving the knowledge of truth for there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins(hebrews 10:26).

@BalkanGunsmith,"Looks like a nitrate explosion, judging by the size and smoke. Fertilizer stockpile. They do stockpile fertilizers in harbours. By the shockwave I'd say the explosion was equivalent to about 2 kilotons of tnt. I've seen piles of nitrate fertilizers as big as 2000 tons in way smaller harbours, waiting to be loaded onto trains and trucks. Seems like there was smoke before the detonation, probably the place caught fire. It's unlikely for fertilizers to go of by themselves, but if there were other explosives present at the spot (for example fireworks) those might have initiated the detonation.   An awful tragedy, especilly in those hard times. Best wishes to all people on the spot and their relatives, Condolences to relatives of those who are no more.",5년 전,0,

@iguiste23,"I could be wrong, could be however. Now unless the cargo ports are shipping in Nova bombs or tomahawrks which I doubt sounds like some kind or organised explosion act of war) or some sort of bomb! It takes a million and one things wrong for industrial materials and shipping to cause an explosion that shatters windows over 9.5 miles away and overturn cars. Whatever caused that shockwave was not caused by an exploding cargo ship or some dodgy port shipment and I doubt they're importing and exporting chemicles like uranium or close enough to cause such a long distance shockwave nor do I see any mini small time low level nuclear power stations there. It sounds like someone kenw what they were doing and wanted to cause an explosion or was aware of something illegal being shipped over or something doesn't add sorry. I'm no bomb or explosion expert but I know alot about this sort of genre. The only other explanation of something that could cause such a long range shockwave but small short term damage is a small asteriod impact or metoer like the one in Russia in 2013.
