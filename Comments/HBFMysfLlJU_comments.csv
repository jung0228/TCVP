@MrCowabungaDude,"Yo, my name isn’t my name! I don’t know how to remember people’s names because I can’t remember my own name without my actual identification card stating my actual name! I do have my social, but I don’t feel safe around “socialists”? What are even them?! Is that even a real people? Or are they alien-invaders from the planet Uranus? Their butts? Their planet is butt’ual oriented? Their casualties are into customary bug eating with their mouthy-butts?! I’ve seen movies. I know how to watch movies… but? The character’s names I can’t remember. Seriously. I’ll watch a movie and forget the main character’s name… except for that movie Zoolander. I like that movie so much I remember that Derek is his name. But what about my reality name? I can’t get my real name back? I have to live as an easily identity thieved name for a girl? But everyone claims it’s a boys? You know the weird clownface name… not John. I need my life back on track and it seems like the whole city I live in needs to file for bankruptcy. But I can’t get my real name back, I really need it. It’s like I’m living in a bad Simpson’s episode… the one where Lisa stole Bart’s soul and he couldn’t get it back. I have a good kinetic-energy level, but crazy people keep ruining the environment around me and I cough blood sometimes… I think my inside body is coming out the water kind, but blood. I’ll be going in my room and my brain starts feeling like it’s squeezing hard inside. My nose’l bleed and I start gushing both out my nose and throat… I don’t even go that way as to say I like sucking down low sweat meat, I don’t. I believe god gave me meaning to be thankful, but the blood in my body keeps flowing out after I go back to my room to smoke weed. I know it’s the carcinogens not the weed I been smoking so heavily! Do… I smoke so much the blood I was spewing dried up and I rinse it off after I get so high I’m hungry. I’ll order pizza and by the time I’m eating it… I’m not bleeding anymore! It’s the cars of the world ruining the air and climate change is because of the amble parking spots accumulating radiation as it sits in any California or Washington summer sun! I hypothesis, car covers and restricted automobile movement would help a bit about global-warming and icebergs melting. No one is brave enough to purchase; from their local car dealership; a car-cover and avidly put it over their car everytime they park out near the sun’s rays. I’m sure it’s theft proof too! They’re scared to get targeted for having a strange car shaped umbrella car. Come to reveal it’s just a plain Jane regular non-victim person’s car. I bet it’s probably so advanced that it’s fun to do. AND… it helps the environment from turning our planet into a Muslim hell.",2개월 전,1,

@nanascorner1806,"I'm possessed, which forced an awakening. I'm for the lord, so when it began, I clapped my hands and rubbed them together! Now I'm possessed by the lord after angelic beings and all my ancestors came out of the shadows. My soul left my body and went to hell where 2 giant demons dragged me through dung 💩 on my back. They told me they were going to dismember me and I was laughing hysterically bc of what i was thinking and just the whole situation.   Before this, I lived a whole life not knowing if this was all real and then actuality seeing it made the Bible make sense.  When you die and go to hell, you go on what you have on. I recommend good boots bc after I chased then down abs scared then off for trading my tennis shoe, bc there's all this trash and literal dung bc they are hooved beasts covered in it. That's why they angel like that.  Being there and our being real.  They look a lot like the beasts on ""Where the wild things are"" but they are like dogs that roll in it.  I'm observing their behavior and then I was like, ""Wtf! Yak are retarded!"" And started laughing. I have lived too long and been trig wise hell in this life. My early childhood neve the terror of off me.  Christ was down there and he was (i think) trying to save me.  His face told me more tab his wife could, bc I'm laughing at demons (13 ft tall x 5 ft wide, by my estimate).  They told me they were going to dismember me abs showed me by the fact they had me on my back and we're dragging me by my feet life out was nothing, so it was very obvious. I asked them why they needed to tally about their plans if I wasn't in their future. I figured well if this it, here goes.   I came back to my body laughing my as off.  My body was under my bed.  then a demon calling himself ""Robert"" came ""unto me"".  I wasn't really religious, just for the lord.  I'm about the ""be and do you"" God made me AND you.    I got up and walked out of hell, laughing.  I locked the gates behind me. Then returned back to my body, that apparently was pulled under the bed by my feet.",2개월 전,0,

Obviously we don't really know where we would be on the calender cause it's not like the universe is over or starting again. Also pretty sure they can say we been around much longer than 412 years.

@maizestudios9733,"This Key and Peele skit is just another cringe-inducing example of their so-called 'comedy.' I mean, seriously, making fun of the government's decisions like they have some insider knowledge? It's not only idiotic but also painfully unfunny. It's like they're trying to be these pseudo-intellectuals, and it's just embarrassing.  The lack of creativity is astounding. Mocking geopolitical issues and pretending they have some profound insight into the world? Please. It's as if they googled 'controversial topics' and decided to make a skit about it without any real substance. It's a pathetic attempt at relevancy, and frankly, they're failing miserably.  If Key and Peele put even a fraction of the effort they exert in these poorly thought-out skits into crafting genuinely funny content, maybe they wouldn't be relegated to recycling tired political clichés. Their attempts at satire are so surface-level that it's painful to watch. Maybe they should take a break from pretending to be political pundits and focus on creating something that doesn't induce secondhand embarrassment.",1년 전,0,

@persona2grata,"I had an experience not entirely unlike the French restaurant. After high school me and my best friend traveled around Europe for a couple months, something we'd been planning and saving for for years, and I was the designated ""German"" guy because I'd taken a couple years. Anyway, we were in Austria at a restaurant and I was supposed to order for us when I realized that A. people speak a lot faster when actually conversing in a language than they do in a class and B. once you learn the grammar and whatnot for a language, the main barrier to understanding a conversation is knowing words well enough that you can follow a thread when someone is talking quickly, because there are things like tense and gender, plurals, etc. that sound just different enough that you don't instantly make the connection to the root word. Anyhow, we wanted steaks and we got them, sort of. Technically what I ordered was the ""Hunter's Platter"" that was this absurd dish for a table that contained like 4 steaks, a dozen sausages, and like 3 other types of meat. The plate must have weighed 25 lbs. Fortunately it was just a couple of friends and not a date, so could laugh about it and pack like 10lb of meat each in to-go bags for meals for the next few days. My friend also wanted a salad, so we ordered that and what we got was a ""meat salad"" which was rolled slices of ham with cream cheese filling. Needless to say we were both laughing pretty hard by that point, and fortunately for us we walked everywhere, so we actually managed to burn a lot of those calories.",1년 전,1,

What good thing shall I do, I've obeyed all the commandments! Jesus said:  If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me. 22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions. 23 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. 24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved? 26 But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. This culminated obviously In jesus sacrafice for the sin of man so that anyone who believes and repents will be forgiven and saved as a gift rather than anything we could do because perfection was impossible, and full forgiveness was required.

@mini2713,"Who Is Christ? Your Question Will Be Answered Today.   ( Jesus The Messiah/ Yeshua Ha Mashiach) Our Living Passover Acts Chapter 4 verse 12: ” There is no salvation through anyone else, nor is there any other name under heaven given to the human race by which we are to be saved.” Isaiah 9 vs. 6, ” For unto us a Child is born. Unto us a Son is given, and the government will be upon His shoulder. And His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. “ Who is Christ? Who is Jesus? Born of a virgin, Mary. Matthew Chapter 1 verse 20: ” behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to him (Joseph), in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for that (Christ) which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. Jesus, the Christ, is God’s word made into flesh. 1 John chapter 5 verse 7: ” For there are three that bear a record in heaven, The Father, The Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one.” John chapter 1 verse 1: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."" John chapter 1 verse 14:  "" And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.” John chapter 1 verse 10:  ""He was in the world, and the world  knew Him not.” Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12:  ""For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.” How beautiful and awesome is God’s Word, who is our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, magnificent in all His glory, is He.  Amen! John’s Vision Of Christ Seated On His Throne In Heaven: Revelation chapter 4 verse 2 to 3:  ""Immediately, I (John), was in the Spirit, and behold a throne sat in Heaven, and One sat on the throne. And He who sat there was like a jasper and a sardius stone in appearance, and there was a rainbow around the throne, in appearance like an emerald.”  Why did Christ Jesus came and sacrificed His precious life for sinners like us? Christ (God’s Word made into flesh), came because through flesh (Adam’s flesh) sin entered the world, and then because of sin death entered the whole earth. Through flesh (Jesus Christ’s flesh), the earth will be saved, sin is destroyed, and the curse of death  shall be broken, death and the grave shall be cast into hell. Christ, who is God’s Word made into flesh, sacrificed His life for us. He was crucified for our sins and transgressions. Christ died, and on the third day He resurrected in the flesh, conquering death and the grave. Now,  Christ is seated in Heaven, at the right hand of Power (God). Through Christ’s sacrifice we gain Salvation through God’s abundant mercy and grace. We are reconciled and recompensed back to God, through the shed blood of His beloved Son Christ Jesus. John chapter 3 verse 16: ""For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life.” Romans chapter 5 verse 8: ""But God demonstrates His love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.”  Christ came to undo the sin and eternal death brought upon the world through the sin of Adam. Death in Adam, Life In Christ: Romans chapter 5 verse 19: ""For as by one man’s disobedience (Adam), many were made sinners, so also by one Man’s (Jesus) obedience, many will be made righteous.” Romans chapter 5 verse 18:  ""Therefore, as through one man’s (Adam’s) offense judgement came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even through one Man’s (Christ’s) righteous act, the free gift came to all men, resulting in the justification of life.” Romans chapter 5 verse 17:  ""For if by the one man’s offense (Adam’s offense), death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in the life through the One (Jesus Christ)."" Romans chapter 5 verse 12:  ""Therefore, just as through one man (Adam) sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned.” Romans chapter 5 verse 21:  “So that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”  Through Adam, sin and death entered the world, so that is why Christ Jesus came to give life, and give it more abundantly. Yes, Christ came to give eternal life through Salvation. The Salvation of His shed blood, and resurrection. Adam’s flesh brought sin, death, destruction, and condemnation. 1 Corinthians 15 : 21-22, “For since by man(Adam) came death, by Man(Christ), also came the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ, all shall be made alive.” Christ’s sacrifice, the crucifixion of His flesh, brings reconciliation of sins, resurrection, eternal life and salvation.  Christ is coming back again, not as a sacrificial lamb. He is coming back as a roaring, warring lion, to destroy sin, death, and the grave once and for all. Amen! Halleluyah! Revelation chapter 22 verse 12 to 13: ” And behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be. I am the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last. “ Now do you see friends, why Christ Jesus is so Important for our Salvation? Yes. Now, do you understand why there is only one way to God, and that is only through Christ Jesus? Yes. Christ is Salvation. Christ is our Lord and Saviour. Christ is the only way to God. Christ is the only Mediator between God and men (us humans). God loves us so much, He does not want anyone to perish in hell. God wants all sinners to be saved. That is why He sent His Word to save the world. God’s Word became flesh, and dwelt among us to save us. Christ is God’s living Word. Will you accept Christ and be saved? Your eternity depends on it. What happens after death, is what's  important. Where will you spend eternity? Romans chapter 6 verse 23: ”  For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” John Chapter 3 verse 16: ” For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.” Salvation is free! Christ already paid the price, all you have to do is receive salvation through acceptance of Jesus Christ, Yeshua Ha Massiach.  So who is Christ? He is The Word Of God. He is the Son of God. He is God. He is the image of the invisible God. He is the Alpha and Omega. He is the beginning and the end. He is the Great I Am. He is Emmanuel. He is The Christ. He is The Messiah. He is The Creator. He is our Lord and Saviour. He is our Mediator. He is the Lion and the Lamb. He is The Rock not cut out by human hands. He is the Root of David. He is Salvation. He is the way, the truth, and life. He is the promise fulfilled to Abraham. Amen!   I love you Lord!  God created the heavens and the earth with His spoken Word. Did you know that Jesus is that Word, through which all things were created? Yes. John chapter 14 verse 6: ""Jesus said to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” Colossians chapter 1 verse 15 to 16: ""He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him.” John chapter 1 verse 1 to 4: ""In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.”  I hope that you now know and understand Christ better, without any doubts, to the glory of God. Amen! Christ is for all who will receive Him. This is how our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ said we should pray. Matthew chapter 6 verse 9 to 13: “Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be Your name, Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, As we forgive our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.” Now that you understand who Christ is, share Christ with others. Christ is The Good News. What do we do with good news? We share it. Amen!  Repent of your sins. Sin no more! Be baptized in Jesus Name. Submit to God. Love God with all your heart, mind, body, soul, and spirit. Keep God’s Commandments. Love one another. Forgive one another. It is written, “resist the devil, submit to God, and the devil will flee from you.” Hate sin with all your heart, mind, body, soul, and spirit.  Rejoice Our King Is Scheduled To Return  Revelation 19 verse 13-16, "" He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God, and the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him on white horses. Now out of His mouth goes a sharp sword that with it He should strike the nations, and He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron. He Himself treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And He has on His robe, and on His thigh a name written: King of Kings And Lord of Lords."" Ride on King Jesus!

@777lucifero,"11:30 sadly that applies to ''protests'' too, 99% are there just because it's ''the place to be'', not because they really have anything to say. That was the case in the 60's 70's too, don't be fooled. Frank Zappa was adamant about that. He was hoping in the future technology would help young people to be actually informed, rather than just coming for the personal social aspect of it. That's just how most humans are, and there's no way around it. Because if you had a society with less sheeps, you would not be able to steer it anywhere.

Also, being the FIRST to do something...doesn't make them the best.   They are historic. Not timeless like maybe a Dick Van Dyke and a Mary Tyler Moore or any other number of comedic duos in various forms, but sure, they'll EXTREMELY well regarded.  That doesn't make them the ""best."" Even you, in your moment of weakness where weren't just oozing arrogance, you used the word SUBJECTIVE.   So to pretend there IS one right answer? My answer goes to you.

You should question why you can't handle someone thinking K+P are not that funny and not that original.   But, you are a fan ..and by fan, I mean Fanatic.   I'd advise you, watch more comedy outside of your safety zone.

@scourge8097," @meatyp09  Well...good chance their bodies would leave their souls when the two white guys who got their starts in vaudville in the 1930's so black men on TV in white face(which...LOL...sounds silly and I am NOT equating to blackface) mocking black people!  I'm kinda kidding, but...I imagine they'd probably lose their shit over a whole lot in comedy now. They were clean comics and IIRC, I don't think they were big fans of Lenny Bruce and the political comedy. Or at least those two genre's seemed to be at odds.   But honestly...I don't think they'd feel a bit of sympathy for Dave. Getting fucked by the promoters or the managers was part of business...so a giant corporation that offered Dave a ton of money, I'd bet they jump all over that. Those guys had to work like...230 days a year(I'm going off a very vague memory of how often they performed). They'd probably look at what Dave did and think he was crazy(and...lets be honest, he was a little crazy...that took a lot of balls to walk away from that money over principle).   I'm not sure what you mean about Key and Peele though. Did they get screwed by Comedy Central or...are you just talking about the evolution in kinda partner comedy?   Anyway, definitely gotta respect the old guys. They paved the way for the Lenny Bruce's, who paved the way for the Carlin/Pryor's who paved the way for...Eddie and...I guess Sienfield, though I've always thought his standup was overrated, he just had a great shot, but they all kinda make it easier for the next generation.   Well, until Amy Schummer came along. I think she made it harder for future female comedians!",3년 전,0,

@meatyp09," @scourge8097  nothing happened with Key and Peele their show just replaced Dave’s and Dave wasn’t crazy for doing what he did. It’s his show, doesn’t matter how much money you throw at me you won’t control my show. For the comedy today, we get a lot of things raw. That does not mean the people wouldn’t like the the comedy it brings. Everyone won’t like it, it’s that way now. A lot of comics today make people uncomfortably, but what we’ve figured out that they weren’t thinking about then is that is the point. Taking things that would be uncomfortable and making them funny. I think a good bit of people would come around to our comedy, some would be scared to admit it but they would give in especially when they see the others who enjoy it without worrying about what others think of them. I’ve seen that happen.",3년 전,0,
@scourge8097," @meatyp09  Well...it wasn't his show, they named it after him, but he did walk away from 50M dollars over creative differences. Which...I think is crazy. That's generational money. But I don't say it in a derogatory way.  I wasn't using a medical diagnoses, just an opinion...  As for the second part...I'm not disagreeing with you. Comedy has been used for decades to make people uncomfortable and shine poke fun at uncomfortable things. I thought I kinda listed a lot of people who did that...from Bruce to Carlin, Pryor...maybe not Eddie so much or Seinfield, but later Patrice, Bill Burr...and you've also seen a lot of comedians transition into more serious political commentary or even into politics like Bill Maher(who's ""comedy"" is debatable, but he does exactly what you've suggested) John Stewart, Oliver, Trevor Noah, Jim Jefferries, Oliver...etc...  Edit-Obviously Key and Peele kinda fit that crossover between the partner act and the social commentary and pushing people outside their comfort zone. I THINK that's what you're saying...and I don't really think that's a controversial take. Of course they take things that are uncomfortable and make them funny.",3년 전(수정됨),0,
@meatyp09," @scourge8097  I never said i thought you disagreed. I was also saying the making uncomfortable things funny as a in general thing with comedy. I think you misunderstood the whole thing. When I was talking about people having to change their look on comedy because of the way people mostly got clean comedy, I was just saying they could have changed their minds like people did eventually. I wasn’t just talking about Key and Peele, as for Dave it wasn’t just putting his name on it he was the show. 50 mill is generational money but he was already a millionaire. He is the best to ever do standup comedy. I had him right behind Pryor, until recently. He made double that from all the specials on Netflix. It’s crazy if it was somebody other than Dave Chapel. The show was amazing but he don’t need that show he’s still Dave his shows will sell out until he stops doing it. Can’t really say it’s crazy when he already had money and could easily make more elsewhere. It was the principle, I get you don’t agree with what he did. That is a lot of money but that’s speaking for me and you, he didn’t need it. They went back on their word and tried to control the show. They fucked up a good thing. Don’t fix it if ain’t ain’t broke.",3년 전,1,
@scourge8097," @meatyp09  I didn't say I don't AGREE with what he did...but you're presenting it quite a bit differently than it was.  I literally said I respect his decision to do so...but he hadn't made the type of money at that point where he could live the life HE wanted without having to worry. You are obviously a fan of Dave. You've heard him talk about howbue though he'd made a mistake, or he wondered if he'd just fucked up.  Also, yes, obviously HE was the show. There's no Chappelle show without...Chappelle.  I was simply saying he didn't own it...as you normally don't when you're young and you're just breaking in. You sell a show.   Anyway, best of all time...as always, these things are subjective. I'd probably go with Carlin, but I think he's universally regarded as being in that group as the best.  His past few specials though...I don't think they've been that funny, they've been more....kinda funny lectures.  It's not just stand up comedy. He has an agenda, a point he wants to make about certain issues and he's still certainly funny, but it's just been unique.   He's become less stand up and more....story-teller. Fittingly he won the Twain award....but it's like the best actor. They're going to differ, but MOST people are going to include him in a very small group as the best.",3년 전,0,
@meatyp09," @scourge8097  Carlin is up there, and unlike most I like the story telling aspects of his new stuff. Subjective yea, but in everything we do sports or not we name someone who is universally know as the best in that said thing. The person who is named the best isn’t thought to be the best by everyone just the majority. Carlin is funny, his older stuff being his best it still doesn’t stack up to Pryor, who is universally know as the best stand up comedian to ever do it. Dave in my opinion passed him, also I wasn’t presenting anything differently, I know how Hollywood works, they don’t give a damn about anything but the bottom line if data is telling none funny people to do this and add that, you do exactly as Dave did and get the he’ll out of their. It’s his name attached to the corny stuff they wanted him to do. I know what you were talking about when you said it ain’t his show, again I know how show biz works as you see he left, and the show was over. They kept Siri g reruns but you can’t replace him and it ain’t because of the name. It’s simply because of his talent, he light years above anybody doing comedy right now. Like I said 50 mill is a lot to walk away from if ya name ain’t Dave Chappelle, he didn’t have to have 50 Mill in the bank he was still a million who could make more. That’s my point, he could make more, he didn’t have to wait to do it. He chose to take some time off when he left the show it was his decision. He came back like he never left. He could of capitalized off how they did him he was at his peak, it was nothing stopping him from making money if he wanted to work. I’m a fan of most of these comedians not just Dave, you mentioned Bill Maher earlier watch his show all the time it’s the only way I can tolerate talk about politics. Like his stand up too, Bill Burr love him too. Dave ain’t my Favorite that’s Katt Williams, Dave just happens to be the best.",3년 전,1,

They have an endless supply of great story ideas that are unique and different from one another and flesh all the details of the production out to a wonderful extent. They truly are keen observers of human behavior and amazing at portraying an unbelievable range! They bring in great supporting cast members. Never laughed so hard for an hour straight!

One of the leading causes of death, not to mention some of the health conditions that are the top causes of death, would be reduced if people had more practical options and didn't use a car to get everywhere.  My comment has nothing to do with the skit being funny or not and little to being outraged by it (I'm not)..just a tad annoyed by society that something like that traffic related incidents are too common..nice reading comprehension skills..just that it was predictable given how common such incidents are and how generally acceptable it is by gov. and policymakers + how long the skit went on for..only ending was something dramatic..getting run over by a car.

I don’t think it was cool how chappelle acted like they copied his show, he didn’t come up with sketch comedy he didn’t even come up with that format, but he was absolutely the pioneer for a black ran sketch comedy show. And yes key and peele were on a sketch show before Dave (Madtv) but they didn’t create that show, nor was it nearly as influential as chappelle or even their own stuff. Take out chappelle, as funny as they are I don’t see what they brought that wasn’t in comedy before, and that’s normally what “once in a generation” means. Mr Show change how this generation looked at sketch comedy, Tim and Eric pretty much pioneered aspects of meme and internet culture, key and peele didn’t even have a show until like the 2010s.

@drseuss5407,"Agreed! For overpopulation the problem is there's no good way to go for those who want, 65 prevent of this planet has been waiting all their life to go, they're forced to be here, and we overpopulate because it means you get 60 percent of someone else's income in child $upport, kids mean money and multiple partners and children   Don't make available a fentanyl euthanasia drink by the 10,000 gallon vat and the 65 percent of the planet that world say thanks won't get to go yet, but might even replicate after some bad one night stands, and you won't more than double available resources, or you will keep 1M in insurance and state aid money never paid out, and social security they paid into, to the end you create some cool jobs for people and dispensaries and no more crime, and everyone in the world that remains will be people that actually want to be here without botch job suicide attempts for a worse existence, and everyone in the world would have two houses, two cars, an oil supplies to last the planet, and they could have a cow, with ice cream on top, unless they eat the cow, then they need another one   Just saying..   Or get an ass graft on your face when they keep trying and you get black fungus necrotizing your facial tissue, why get a facial? They keep trying   Make euthanasia   1/3 off the world population starving may reach 2/3. Dump ocean water into dry rivers with ocean fish, have an ocean river, desal at farms, steam distiller at the kitchen sink, disinfected and salt free   Collect America's lawn mower clippings for more cattle, new jobs. Instead we export corn and beef and have a storage and import meat from other countries  They tried to make viruses to eliminate half the world, they are unsuccessful, wait till a mobster has to get an ass graft on his face from some  black fungus sprayed, unreal. 65 percent of the world would say thanks for a synthetic opioid euthanasia drink by the 10,000 gallon vat, I could have done agenda 21 better 8 years ago   If you won't be compassionate to the majority, nor will the the ruling minority to all. To them it is a matter of choice: Theirs   Soon your cities will be without water, unless you hire people for US currency which costs the same to print as unemployment without a future and pump desalinated water from the ocean into river systems   we're not being drawn to the sun,  There's two black holes on the surface, whatever was gravitationally drawn to the core went there, and the overall gravity of the sun increased but it got hotter but we're moving away and angry solar flares and CMEs are coming after us for leavingg   Heat pushes clouds causing flooding on other parts of this planet while coronal mass ejection and solar flares from magnetic connections from the sun to the earth are increasing. One day maybe it will arc weld this iron ball if we don't cross elliptical orbit line with the moon. Tell NASA about the moon and a year and a half later they make Moonfall. They should make a euthanasia for everyone who wants to go, or be stuck to endure the future even if you don't want to be here at all???   With the moon it'd be a tsunami one way and a volcano the other, the future of our relationship with the sun is a different issue    However,   65 percent of the planet would take a synthetic opioid drink by the 10,000 gallon vat and say thanks,     1/3 off the world is starving to death, 5 percent need bones they can't or don't want to get replaced, 5 percent need organs they can't or don't want to get replaced, 5 percent are terminally ill 5 percent chronic pain, 5-10 percent never wanted to be here anyway, and everyone else will have a peaceful way to go when they want. There's no good way to go, some are 18 and 0 and going through death and not actually dying is not fun, some attempts are violent to go through.  Instead of making a euthanasia available to everyone who wants to go they kill .08 percent of the world population in two years.  Everyone was the target. I would have helped the 65 percent go 8 yrs ago.     They're getting a dime instead of a dollar in creating good   There needs to be a peaceful easy way for everyone  when they want to go. Guy saves 1M in state aid, paid 600k in social security, doesn't have to die every day, just gets to leave before suffering. The guy with the kids gets 800 k from Uncle Sam in life insurance he never signed up for and Uncle Sam keeps the other 800k. Free euthanasia. Cut inflation by more than half, more than doubled available resources. Have a job by a company which pays all the taxes and picks up grass clippings M-S to take it to fields now with cows on it, 4x your US cattle with lawn mower clippings from every years, save 2500 on property taxes and make sure your clippings are out in your neighborhood on Tuesdays   Pump desalinated water from ocean wave current into river systems ASAP. It costs the same to print unemployment and section 8 as it fits a job with a paycheck that won't even take your house away   Here's your check if you love your neighbors and don't want to leave your free housing, and here's your bigger check if you want to rent on the private market   More confusing paint corporations pay all the taxes making useful cool jobs like a mint company your paper actually goes somewhere and a quarter turns back into a dollar   Dig out 10 ' of river bed and cast and set two 10' pipelines to being Atlantic ocean water to every house, use steam distiller for salt free disinfected water at the kitchen sink, dump waste water into sealed pipelines. It took a turn 2 years to dig out 10' of riverbed, everyone could be back to work working in every town and we'd be at with new infrastructure. Don't put salt in your water, have more salt for more roads in the winter.  Send salt water straight to homes, they'll use a distiller for their few gallons of driving and cooking water and they're off toilet to tap loop. Use electrolysis for energy from salt water.  At the very least, feed rivers with desal water immediately to quickly overcome drought shortages, no problem   Make a grass and corn crop that grows in ocean water hybrid with say, oceanic grass root structures, best genetic corn crop growing in salt water in Texas and Arizona while you solar desalinate more oxygen and hydrogen into the air in a 24/7/365 grow season with ocean water and no weeds growing in salt water crops or lawns, fill your swimming pool with ocean water and water your lawn with salt water, don't put salt in your what salt water put it in the roads, use a small steam distiller made of glass and stainless to get disinfected and salt water free water for cooking and drinking, maybe an ocean let for your pool, were have to deal with ocean water rise, how about a Dolphin?       Make more indoor fish farms, clean fish into a flash freezer, people eat fish, kid makes 90 k a year running fishing equipment not $9 an hour people eat well   People could be cremated visible to the public and the smoke can be required in a gallon of water and the ashes and cement combined and people can be made into a concrete cast or flower pot. Otherwise, if they get cremated, without a filter, or dissolved in alkyld they go down a drain?   And they had that place giving fake ashes and selling bodies   Maybe you could make a wireless Tesla bridge (like when you touch a Tesla ball and the current comes towards you, though you are in the millivolts) to draw CMEs from the sun to say, Mars, maybe you'll stop the earth from frying   Only on this planet are you forced to exist by the people that want you gone and say they want to reduce world's population by half, I'd say it's irony but that's why people want to leave earth and go to Mars, they secretly secretly want to steal the iron , shh don't tell anyone",2년 전,0,

@midcitycool3946,Look up black act 1722 The Black act The black act was a law on the books in parts of Europe that prohibited people who wasn't brown or black to put black face on their face they were incarcerated some were killed a lot of them were sent to the Americas the penal colonies so the settlers and the colonists were prisoners do you understand sellers in colonists were prisoners so they were sent over here by the thousands and thousands they were sent over here to the Americas they were sent over here to be indentured servants slaves don't sign contracts indentured servants sign contracts they were indentured to do years due to the fact that they bartered and made a deal with their jail sentence they were sent over here The people who sent them here were the brown and the black skin Moorish people who were in control back then and we were on both sides of the continent when the prisoners came to the Americas they were greeted by more brown and darker skinned it black people I hate using that term black people because black is a construct Black is not a race slowly but surely the revolutionary war was fault by the colonists against the British elite meaning the Moorish people who sent them over here that what the revolutionary what was about and to be frank about that Abraham Lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation that released the induction servitude of the Caucasian people not the black people who were slaves but the Caucasian people who were indentured but the funny thing is this post have been the new world a lot of those so-called Caucasian people didn't know about the new world there wasn't a lot of Caucasians over here they were few if any so this great big landmass North America South America and Central America was governed by Brown in dark skin people just think about that so when the civil war happened and like I said Lincoln signed their emancipation proclamation and it did help the slaves that were caught up in that but the slaving of so-called black people didn't start in America's until the 1830s to the 1850s because the Caucasians who were colonist s were let go from the jails because they took over then that's when they started enslaving us it's just like when the inmates overtake the prison The prisoners become the controllers of the jail so that's what happened it's all in the library of Congress look it up or you got to do is read it look what white indentured servitude just look it up look up black indentured servitude,10개월 전,0,

@StefunnyStrange,"@YOUTUBE I'm not liking the new ""upgrade"" where you group videos/notifications together. Why are yall always changing s**t that literally NO ONE on the planet asked for or needed. It didn't improve the app, it actually discourages me from clicking on videos when there are 3+ new uploads. I dont have time to watch literally EVERY video from every creater I subscribe to so I kinda depend on titles and thumbnails to determine if I'm interested in clicking on the video. Especially with channels like this where I have already seen most of the sketches. You showing me that Key & Peele uploaded 3 videos means nothing to most people like me. I wouldn't be surprised if creators who upload multiple times a week are actually getting less views now because of yalls need to add upgrades that make the app worse. FIX IT.  /rant over",3년 전,2,
